====================================================================

CONCLUSION

This homeschool co-op configuration faces moderate-high regulatory burden primarily due to San Francisco's restrictive zoning laws regarding educational activities in residential areas. While the small scale (5 students) reduces many compliance requirements compared to larger educational facilities, the fundamental question of zoning approval remains the critical success factor.

The estimated regulatory burden score of 6/10 reflects:
- Moderate complexity in navigating zoning requirements
- Reasonable costs if zoning approval obtained
- Potential for project termination if zoning denied
- Limited ongoing compliance burden once established

Success depends heavily on early zoning consultation and willingness to adapt the business model based on regulatory constraints. Alternative structures (informal cooperation, commercial location) should be considered if residential educational use proves problematic.
