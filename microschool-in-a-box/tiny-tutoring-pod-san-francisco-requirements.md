### CRITICAL RISK FACTORS:

## CONCLUSION

The tiny tutoring pod configuration represents a **significant improvement** over larger microschool operations in terms of regulatory compliance burden. The elimination of food service requirements and reduced building code impacts create substantial savings in both time and cost.

However, **zoning compliance remains the critical success factor**. The determination of whether this activity can occur in a residential setting will dictate the feasibility and cost of the entire operation.

**Success Strategy:** Focus early efforts on zoning consultation and approval before proceeding with other permits and licenses. The small scale of the operation may work in favor of obtaining residential business permissions, but this must be verified through proper channels.
