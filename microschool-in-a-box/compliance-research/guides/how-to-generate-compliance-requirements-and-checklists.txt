HOW TO GENERATE MICROSCHOOL COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS AND CHECKLISTS
================================================================

This guide explains how to create complete compliance documentation for any microschool scenario (parameters + location) in a single comprehensive document.

OVERVIEW
========
For each microschool scenario, you will create ONE consolidated document containing:
1. State-level compliance requirements with sources
2. County/local-level compliance requirements with sources
3. Ordered compliance checklist with dependencies and timelines
4. All supporting documentation and citations

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: SOURCE DOCUMENTATION
==========================================
ALL factual claims must be supported with specific sources using this format:
[URL; specific location on page]

Examples:
- "California requires private schools to file an affidavit annually" [https://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/ps/rq/psprivateschools.asp; Section "Annual Affidavit"]
- "Maximum occupancy is calculated at 50 square feet per child" [https://up.codes/viewer/california/ca-building-code-2019/chapter/10/means-of-egress#1004.5; Table 1004.5]
- "Alameda County requires a conditional use permit for more than 8 students in residential zones" [https://alamedacounty.gov/sections/zoning/Pages/default.aspx; Article 17-18.050]

Acceptable source types:
- Government agency websites (.gov domains)
- Official regulatory codes and statutes
- County/city official websites
- Professional licensing board websites
- Official fee schedules from government agencies

STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS
===================

STEP 1: PREPARE PARAMETERS FILE
-------------------------------
Create or select a parameters file that defines the microschool model:

Required parameters:
- State: [STATE]
- County: [COUNTY]
- Number of teachers: [NUMBER]
- Number of children: [NUMBER/RANGE]
- Age of youngest child: [AGE]
- Age of oldest child: [AGE]
- Parents present: [YES/NO]
- Food served: [YES/NO]
- Building type: [RESIDENTIAL DWELLING/COMMERCIAL/RELIGIOUS/OTHER]

Example parameter files are located in: compliance-research/parameters/
Template file: compliance-research/parameters/parameters-template.txt

STEP 2: CHECK FOR EXISTING DOCUMENTATION
----------------------------------------
Before researching, check if compliance documentation already exists:

1. Navigate to: compliance-research/[STATE]/[COUNTY]/
2. Look for: [county-name]-microschool-compliance-documentation.txt
3. If file exists and covers your parameters, update as needed
4. If file doesn't exist OR doesn't cover your specific parameters, proceed to STEP 3

STEP 3: RESEARCH AND CREATE CONSOLIDATED COMPLIANCE DOCUMENTATION
----------------------------------------------------------------
Create a single comprehensive document following this structure:

DOCUMENT TEMPLATE:

END OF TEMPLATE
===============

STEP 4: DOCUMENT CREATION PROCESS
---------------------------------

1. Use the microschool compliance research guide as your framework:
   File: compliance-research/guides/microschool-compliance-research-guide.md

2. Research all 7 state categories plus local requirements
3. Document EVERY factual claim with a source in [URL; location] format
4. Verify all fee amounts with official sources
5. Confirm all contact information is current
6. Order checklist steps by dependencies 
7. Test dependency logic: can step X be done without step Y?

3. Create the consolidated file:
   compliance-research/[STATE]/[COUNTY]/[county-name]-microschool-compliance-documentation.txt

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
================

1. Always reference the exact parameters file you're using
2. Focus on mandatory legal requirements, not best practices  
3. Get specific fee amounts from official fee schedules, not estimates
4. Include processing times for applications from official sources
5. Order checklist steps by what must be completed first
6. Test dependency ordering - can step X be done without step Y?
7. Include agency phone numbers and email addresses from official directories
8. Note when direct contact is required for current information
9. Keep language simple and actionable
10. Update files when regulations change
11. CRITICAL: Source every single factual claim with [URL; specific location]
12. Double-check all URLs are active and point to the correct information
13. Use official government sources (.gov) whenever possible
14. For fee amounts, always cite the official fee schedule page
15. For contact information, cite the official agency directory page
