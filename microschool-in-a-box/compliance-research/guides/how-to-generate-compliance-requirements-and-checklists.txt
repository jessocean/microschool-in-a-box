HOW TO GENERATE MICROSCHOOL COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS AND CHECKLISTS
================================================================

This guide explains how to create complete compliance requirements and actionable checklists for any microschool scenario (parameters + location).

OVERVIEW
========
For each microschool scenario, you need to generate:
1. State-level compliance requirements file
2. County/local-level compliance requirements file  
3. Ordered compliance checklist with dependencies and timelines

STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS
===================

STEP 1: PREPARE PARAMETERS FILE
-------------------------------
Create or select a parameters file that defines the microschool model:

Required parameters:
- Number of teachers: [NUMBER]
- Number of children: [NUMBER/RANGE]
- Age of youngest child: [AGE]
- Age of oldest child: [AGE]
- Parents present: [YES/NO]
- Food served: [YES/NO]
- Building type: [RESIDENTIAL DWELLING/COMMERCIAL/RELIGIOUS/OTHER]

Example parameter files are located in: compliance-research/
Template file: compliance-research/parameters-template.txt

STEP 2: CHECK FOR EXISTING STATE REQUIREMENTS
---------------------------------------------
Before researching, check if state requirements already exist:

1. Navigate to: compliance-research/[STATE]/
2. Look for: state-regulations.txt
3. If file exists and covers your parameters, proceed to STEP 4
4. If file doesn't exist OR doesn't cover your specific parameters, proceed to STEP 3

STEP 3: GENERATE STATE REQUIREMENTS (IF NEEDED)
-----------------------------------------------
If no suitable state requirements file exists:

1. Use the microschool compliance research guide as your framework:
   File: compliance-research/guides/microschool-compliance-research-guide.md

2. Research all 7 categories for your specific parameters:
   - School licensing requirements
   - Employment law requirements  
   - Business registration requirements
   - Tax obligations
   - Building and fire safety requirements
   - Food service requirements (if applicable)
   - Accreditation requirements

3. Create state-regulations.txt file with these sections:
   - Parameters used (reference exact parameter file)
   - Date of research
   - Legal requirements by category
   - Compliance criteria for each requirement
   - Mandatory fees with specific amounts
   - Enforcement agencies and contacts
   - Statutory citations

4. Store file at: compliance-research/[STATE]/state-regulations.txt

STEP 4: GENERATE COUNTY/LOCAL REQUIREMENTS
------------------------------------------
Research county and local requirements:

1. Create county folder if it doesn't exist:
   compliance-research/[STATE]/[COUNTY]/

2. Research local requirements focusing on:
   - Zoning requirements and permits
   - Building permits and codes
   - Local business licenses
   - Food service permits (if applicable)
   - Local enforcement contacts

3. Create county requirements file:
   compliance-research/[STATE]/[COUNTY]/[county-name]-requirements.txt

4. Include these sections:
   - Parameters used
   - Date of research  
   - Zoning requirements
   - Building permits
   - Local business licensing
   - Food service permits
   - Enforcement contacts
   - Local code citations

STEP 5: GENERATE COMPLIANCE CHECKLIST
-------------------------------------
Create an ordered, actionable checklist:

1. Combine all state and county requirements
2. Order steps by dependencies (what must be completed first)
3. Include processing times where known
4. Note dependencies between steps
5. Include all mandatory fees and contacts

6. Create checklist file:
   compliance-research/[STATE]/[COUNTY]/[county-name]-microschool-compliance-checklist.txt

7. Checklist format:
   - Numbered steps in dependency order
   - Processing times for applications/approvals
   - Dependencies noted for each step
   - Contact information for agencies
   - Estimated total timeline
   - Mandatory fees summary

State Requirements File:
☐ References specific parameters file used
☐ Includes date of research
☐ Covers all 7 compliance categories
☐ Lists specific legal requirements (not recommendations)
☐ Includes mandatory fees with amounts
☐ Provides enforcement agency contacts
☐ Cites relevant statutes and regulations

County Requirements File:
☐ References specific parameters file used  
☐ Includes local zoning requirements
☐ Covers building permit requirements
☐ Lists local business license requirements
☐ Includes food service permits if applicable
☐ Provides local agency contact information
☐ Cites relevant local codes and ordinances

Compliance Checklist:
☐ Steps ordered by dependencies

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
================

1. Always reference the exact parameters file you're using
2. Focus on mandatory legal requirements, not best practices
3. Get specific fee amounts, not estimates
4. Include processing times for applications
5. Order checklist steps by what must be completed first
6. Test dependency ordering - can step X be done without step Y?
7. Include agency phone numbers and email addresses
8. Note when direct contact is required for current information
9. Keep language simple and actionable
10. Update files when regulations change
