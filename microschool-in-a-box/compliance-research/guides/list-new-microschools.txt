**Goal: Estimate how many microschools have opened in California since 2021**

what “microschool” means (for your project)

We're defining micrischools as "private K–12 schools with ≤100–150 students” and/or “small teacher-led networks (Acton, Wildflower, KaiPod, etc.).” That choice determines which data sources you can use and how “opened” is inferred.

the core data spine (what’s actually published)

CDE Private School files (6+ students only).
Download the annual XLSX files for 2021-22 through 2024-25 from the CDE “Private School Data” page. These are the only statewide, school-level private-school datasets; they include only schools that reported 6+ students on their Private School Affidavit (PSA). 
California Department of Education

Important limitation to note in your methodology.
We're ignoring schools with fewer than 6 children for now. The CDE explicitly says it only compiles and releases data for schools with 6+ students; schools with ≤5 students are not in the public directory. 
California Department of Education

Their FAQ also clarifies that data for schools under six isn’t made public unless you submit a Public Records Act request.

how to infer “opened in the last 4 years”

Because the files don’t include an “opening date,” you infer it by first appearance:

Download the four files (2021-22, 2022-23, 2023-24, 2024-25) from the CDE page. 
California Department of Education

Match and dedupe by CDS code where present (only for 6+ schools) and then by normalized name+address.

For each school, record the first year it appears. Treat that as the “opening year” for public listing purposes. (Caveat: a school might pre-exist with ≤5 students and cross the 6-student threshold later; note this in your limitations section.)

Filter to first‐appearance year ≥ 2021-22 (i.e., Sep 2021–Aug 2025).

Apply your microschool size cap (e.g., ≤150). You can also flag likely microschools by keywords or network membership (below).

fill the gaps the state doesn’t publish

To catch small/brand-new microschools (≤5 students) and confirm networks:

Network/directories to confirm microschool status (coverage is partial):
• KaiPod’s California pages (lists partner microschools by city). 
KaiPod Learning

• Wildflower Schools (network list; NorCal page and “Our Schools” list include CA sites like The Dahlia School SF, Little Tree in Hollister). 
Wildflower Schools

Little Tree

• LA Catholic Schools Microschools Network (named member schools). 
lacatholicschools.org

• Acton Academies operating in CA (directory + entries in the CDE site for specific campuses like Venice Beach and Tej Acton).

Note: the National Microschooling Center deliberately does not publish a public list (safety/privacy), so don’t expect a master directory there.

step-by-step workflow you can run

Build your base table from CDE files (’21-22 → ’24-25). Keep fields: CDS code, name, address, city, county, grades, total enrollment, phone/email, file year/source. 
California Department of Education

First-appearance logic: group by CDS/name+address → min(file year). Mark first_listed_year.

Size filter: keep ≤100 or ≤150 enrollment (whatever you decide).

Network flags:

Look for substrings: “Acton,” “Wildflower,” “KaiPod,” “Microschool,” “Academy,” etc.

Manually cross-check a sample against network pages above; add network and source_url. 
KaiPod Learning
Wildflower Schools

Under-six augmentation: file your CPRA to CDE’s privateschools@cde.ca.gov (listed on the data page) asking for the fields above for first-time PSAs since 9/1/2021. Add those rows with a flag under6_psa = true.

Quality checks:

spot-check websites / Google Maps to verify they’re full-time K–12 schools (not tutoring/enrichment only).

de-dupe multiple campuses of the same brand if your definition treats a campus as a separate “school.”

Document your caveats: explicitly note that “opening year” = first public listing (≥6 students) unless CPRA shows earlier PSA.


quick tips & gotchas

Don’t rely on “microschool” in the name. Many will simply be “Academy” or “Montessori.” Your size filter + first-appearance year does the heavy lifting.

Home-based schools filing PSAs with ≤5 students won’t show up without the CPRA step. Ignore them for now.

Charters: if your definition includes tiny public charters, use the Charter School Locator (export directory, then filter by small enrollment / new schools since 2021).
