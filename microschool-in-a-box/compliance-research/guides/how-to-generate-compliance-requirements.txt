HOW TO GENERATE MICROSCHOOL COMPLIANCE REQUIREMENTS
==================================================

This guide explains how to create complete compliance documentation for any microschool scenario (parameters + location) in a single comprehensive document.

OVERVIEW
========
For each microschool scenario, you will create ONE consolidated document containing:
1. State-level compliance requirements grouped by category
2. County/local-level compliance requirements grouped by category
3. All supporting documentation and citations

CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: SOURCE DOCUMENTATION
==========================================
ALL factual claims must be supported with specific sources using this format:
[URL; specific location on page]

Examples:
- "California requires private schools to file an affidavit annually" [https://www.cde.ca.gov/sp/ps/rq/psprivateschools.asp; Section "Annual Affidavit"]
- "Maximum occupancy is calculated at 50 square feet per child" [https://up.codes/viewer/california/ca-building-code-2019/chapter/10/means-of-egress#1004.5; Table 1004.5]
- "Alameda County requires a conditional use permit for more than 8 students in residential zones" [https://alamedacounty.gov/sections/zoning/Pages/default.aspx; Article 17-18.050]

Acceptable source types:
- Government agency websites (.gov domains)
- Official regulatory codes and statutes
- County/city official websites
- Professional licensing board websites
- Official fee schedules from government agencies

TIPS FOR SUCCESS
================

1. Always reference the exact parameters file you're using
2. Focus on pass/fail criteria, not recommendations
3. Get specific fee amounts from official fee schedules; include URL if fees not published
4. Include processing times for applications from official sources
5. Identify all prerequisites and dependencies with reference URLs
6. Include both form URLs and PDF copies when possible
7. Rank submission methods by preference (email, online, fax, mail, phone)
8. Note when submission methods are unavailable
9. CRITICAL: Source every single factual claim with [URL; specific location]
10. Do not use "may be required" - find specific conditions or document evidence with sources
11. Double-check all URLs are active and point to the correct information
12. Use official government sources (.gov) whenever possible
13. For fee amounts, always cite the official fee schedule page
14. Requirements without specific approving bodies need source evidence and URL
15. Sort by enforcing jurisdiction - do not duplicate state requirements in local section
16. Delete agency contact sections - contacts now listed with relevant approvals
