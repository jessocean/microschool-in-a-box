Guardrails Claude must follow (policy + etiquette)

Honor CDE’s posted policies.

Conditions of Use explains monitoring and acceptable use. Don’t try to evade security; interact like a normal visitor.

Check and respect robots.txt.

CDE’s robots file blocks only certain paths (mostly legacy docs and utility pages). Claude must avoid any disallowed patterns and never treat robots as a “bypass” mechanism.

Throttle generously.

If the site does not specify a crawl-delay, follow Digital.gov’s guidance: default to 1 request every 10 seconds for non-Search.gov bots. (Search.gov’s own usasearch bot is recommended at 2 seconds, but Claude is not that.)

Identify yourself.

Set a descriptive User-Agent string (e.g., “your-org-research-bot/1.0 contact: you@example.com
”) and include a contact email in case rate limits need to be discussed. CDE lists a contact for Private Schools data (see page footer on the data page).

Be cache-friendly and gentle.

Use If-Modified-Since / If-None-Match to avoid redownloading unchanged files, back off on HTTP 429/503, and keep concurrency at 1.
