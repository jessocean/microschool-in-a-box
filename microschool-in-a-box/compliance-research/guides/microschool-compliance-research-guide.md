## File Organization & Documentation Format

### Single Consolidated File per Research Project
Create one comprehensive text file per research project containing both state and local requirements:
- File name: [county-name]-microschool-compliance-requirements.txt
- Location: compliance-research/[STATE]/[COUNTY]/
- Content: Complete requirements documentation for both state and local levels

### Documentation Requirements
Each compliance file must include:
- Parameters used (exact reference to parameters file)
- Date of research
- State requirements grouped by category (zoning, building permits, fire safety, etc.)
- Local requirements grouped by category (zoning, building permits, fire safety, etc.)
- Specific regulatory sources consulted (with citations)
- Precise compliance requirements (not recommendations)
- Mandatory fees (exclude estimated costs)
