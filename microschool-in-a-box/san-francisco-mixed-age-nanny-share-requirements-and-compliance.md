---

## CONCLUSION

The mixed-age nanny share configuration in San Francisco faces **significant regulatory barriers** with an overall burden score of **8/10**. The primary challenges stem from:

1. **Zoning restrictions** on educational use in residential areas
2. **Fire safety requirements** for Group E occupancy
3. **Mixed-age complexity** spanning preschool and K-12 regulations

**Success probability is estimated at 40%** due to high likelihood of zoning denial. **Total costs range from $14,000-40,000+** excluding professional consultation fees.

**Recommendation:** Strongly consider alternative configurations or commercial location to reduce regulatory burden and improve success probability.
