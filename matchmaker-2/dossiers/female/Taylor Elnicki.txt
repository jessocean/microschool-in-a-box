## TYPE QUESTIONS: WHAT THEY BRING & SEEK

### How do they orient to time and commitment?
The tension between biological urgency and relational patience emerges as a central theme. Taylor's timeline consciousness has sharpened post-Baylor—she now leads with her desire for children in dating contexts. Her experience of "long and painful" extraction from misaligned relationships suggests someone learning to honor temporal realities while still struggling with the execution. The NYE 2022 incident reveals how unmet temporal promises (Baylor prioritizing Uber driving over their plans) become symbols of deeper misalignment.

### What is their relationship to uncertainty and change?
Taylor demonstrates iterative learning through relationships—each partnership revealing clearer boundaries and desires. Movement from oppressive platonic living situation → loving but ultimately insufficient romantic relationship → post-breakup clarity about non-negotiables. Her multi-modal healing approach (EMDR, EFT, somatic gut work) suggests someone who approaches transformation as an embodied, systemic process rather than purely cognitive exercise.

### How do they construct meaning and value?
Limited data, but notable patterns: Connection to babies/children appears to be an organizing principle of meaning. Musical expression represents authentic self-expression worth protecting. Financial security operates more as avoidance of negative (being broke) rather than positive aspiration. Requires deeper exploration of intrinsic motivators beyond motherhood.

### What is their embodied experience of connection?
Identified pattern of anxious attachment style (with Baylor's avoidance). Physical joy and competence with babies—face lighting up, natural play, confident handling. Beautiful singing voice suggests capacity for vulnerable expression. History of "losing herself" in connections indicates highly permeable relational boundaries requiring conscious management.

## READINESS QUESTIONS: EVIDENCE & BOTTLENECKS

### What concrete actions have they taken toward partnership?
- Active dating through apps (though unsuccessful)
- Engaged in intensive therapeutic work specifically targeting relational patterns
- Ended relationship with younger man ambivalent about children ("mostly"—note incomplete boundary)
- Maintains communication about desires with close friends
- Sought financial stability through DA program

### How do they relate to their own decision-making?
Complex relationship with agency. Capable of identifying patterns (anxious/avoidant dynamic) but implementation remains challenging. The "mostly" breaking off with ambivalent partner suggests decision-making that includes negotiation with competing desires. ADHD may impact follow-through between insight and action. Demonstrates courage in leaving relationships but process is extended and painful.

### What unresolved tensions might block commitment?
- ADHD-related motivation patterns may conflict with partnership building
- History of "losing herself" in connections not fully resolved
- Financial anxiety potentially competing with family-building timeline
- Possible pattern of knowing what she wants but struggling to maintain boundaries when faced with partial connections

### How do they understand marriage as a practice?
Insufficient data—requires exploration

## META-LAYER: RELATIONSHIP TO MATCHMAKING

### How do they relate to the matchmaking process itself?
Not directly explored, but friendship with interviewer who is developing matchmaking practice suggests potential openness. Demonstrated willingness to discuss intimate relational patterns suggests comfort with depth of disclosure matchmaking requires.

## ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS

### Patterns and anomalies:
- Somatic approach to healing (gut protocol, EMDR, EFT) suggests understanding of embodied transformation
- Musical expression as authentic self that needed protection/encouragement
- Friendships that survive romantic relationship endings (maintained connection with interviewer despite meeting through ex)
- "Lacking strong reasons to do things" except avoidance—suggests need for powerful positive attractors

### Key quotes:
- "She understands herself to be doing a lot of emotional/inner work on holding on to her own desires and not losing herself in a connection just because it feels good in the moment"
- About the NYE incident: "She was very upset by this and saw it as him not valuing her the way she deserved to be valued"

### Assessment confidence level:
Moderate—good understanding of relational patterns and desires, limited data on practical readiness factors and deeper meaning-making structures

### Next steps for information gathering:
- Explore her models of successful partnership/marriage
- Understand geographic flexibility and career aspirations
- Investigate support systems and community connections
- Clarify financial readiness for family building
- Explore religious/spiritual orientation and its role in partnership vision
- Understand what "mostly" means in context of boundary-setting with ambivalent partners
