## TYPE QUESTIONS: WHAT THEY BRING & SEEK

### How do they orient to time and commitment?
Gathered evidence:
- Describes engagement/pregnancy period as "loss of naivete" - repeatedly emphasizes "I had no idea it could be that bad"
- Frames past relationship in terms of not knowing rather than active choice
- Blog reveals someone who experiences time both linearly and symbolically (Winter Solstice birth story)
- Wrote: "Bringing a child into this world is a profound act of faith"

Areas for exploration:
- Specific temporal reasoning around the engagement/pregnancy/separation sequence
- Whether she acknowledges any intuitive knowing she may have dismissed
- How she conceptualizes "right timing" post-trauma

### What is their relationship to uncertainty and change?
Gathered evidence:
- Profound capacity for holding paradox (miracle of birth as both quotidian and sacred)
- Navigated extreme uncertainty during pregnancy/birth/custody battles
- Spiritual practices suggest comfort with mystery and unknowing
- Writing reveals integration of meaning-making and acceptance of meaninglessness

Areas for exploration:
- How trauma has affected her tolerance for uncertainty in relationships
- Whether she trusts her intuitive/embodied knowing after feeling it "failed" her
- Stories of post-separation decisions revealing current relationship to risk

### How do they construct meaning and value?
Gathered evidence:
- Writing is "very important to her" - creates meaning through narrative
- Motherhood experienced as spiritual transformation
- Integrates multiple meaning-making frameworks (psychological, spiritual, somatic)
- Values depth, authenticity, the sacred within the mundane
- Wrote extensively about prayer, symbolism, and wrestling with theodicy

To be explored:
- How she reconciles spiritual openness with need for practical safety
- What she considers sacred in partnership specifically
- Whether meaning-making includes space for a partner's different frameworks

### What is their embodied experience of connection?
Gathered evidence:
- Highly somatic and spiritually sensitive (felt baby "ready to come" early)
- Describes pregnancy changing her "theory of mind" and interpersonal sensitivity
- Complex relationship to romantic love vs. mother love
- History includes "highs of romance" and devastating lows

To be explored:
- Current relationship to romantic/sexual connection post-trauma
- How she experiences attraction and chemistry now

## READINESS QUESTIONS: EVIDENCE & BOTTLENECKS

### What concrete actions have they taken toward partnership?
Current status:
- Acknowledges desire for partnership and more children
- Cites practical barriers: "doesn't have time," dating is "hard with a young child"
- [Need to explore: Active dating attempts, profile creation, childcare arrangements for dating]

### How do they relate to their own decision-making?
Complex picture emerges:
- Past: May have overridden intuitive concerns to pursue motherhood
- Present: Narrative emphasizes external circumstances ("had no idea") over agency
- Blog reveals deep self-reflection but also self-protective distancing from past choices
- Credits mother with "saving her" - suggests openness to support but also possible under-resourcing

Critical questions:
- Does she trust her judgment in selecting partners?
- How does she integrate somatic/intuitive information with practical assessment?
- Evidence of action-taking vs. rumination in recent romantic contexts?

### What unresolved tensions might block commitment?
Identified tensions:
- Safety vs. openness (PTSD from past relationship)
- Desire for more children vs. "disheartened" by dating prospects
- Deep capacity for spiritual connection vs. need for practical partnership
- Time/energy as single mother vs. investment required for dating
- High sensitivity/intuition that may have "failed" to protect her

Potential integration points:

- Clear about desires despite challenges

### How do they understand marriage as a practice?

- Sophisticated understanding of commitment as "profound act of faith"
- Awareness that partnership involves navigating the unknown
- Integrates multiple models (spiritual, psychological, practical)

## META-LAYER: RELATIONSHIP TO MATCHMAKING

### How do they relate to the matchmaking process itself?
To be determined:
- Initial response to structured matching concept
- Comfort level with being "known" given blog's intimate self-revelation

- Willingness to invest financially while managing magazine funding
- Response to feedback about readiness

Relevant factors:
- Comfortable with depth and spiritual exploration
- May appreciate external vetting given past experience
- Time constraints could make structured process appealing
- Trust rebuilding may be necessary

## ADDITIONAL OBSERVATIONS
