An app called OUT; opening up your neighbourhood to make raising children together in the city as effortless as possible.





You're at home with your baby and she's itching to get out of the house. You check your options on your phone:

- join an outing to the farmer's market and the storytime at the library with Kate and her baby--biking there, leaving in 15 minutes

- go over to your neighbours' Jasmine and Peter's place three doors up, so Gwen can play with their toddler Ian, and leave it open for other friends to join--an offer you can take up anytime in the next three hours

- help Deborah with chores for an hour as she recovers from birth and looks after her new baby, with Gwen in tow, any time today, a 30 min bike away

- go to the playground and launch a bat signal to the 30 families nearby in case anyone wants to join you





You're feeling a bit introverted today, so you decide to go to the neighbour's house--you know they'll be working from home and you might get some computer work done too. Plus, it's only a few houses up so it isn't a long commute back for the baby's nap in 2 hours. 





it seems like the social holy grail in parenting is to have the ability to, at any time, do something simple, that leaves you surrounded by responsible people who will watch over your children, exactly the number and type of children your children would like to play with, the comforts of home, and the amount of socialisation you personally would like to do, with people you like and enjoy the company of.  This is the aim of the app--to make develop this sort of social fabric as effortless as possible. 



  



The converse is what people often attest to having--few relationships that feel reliable, and those people are all far away, and scheduling with them is a pain and takes a lot of work, and when you get there the socialising is exhausting for you and no one else is actually looking out for your children so you're both socialising and caregiving. 





A lot of this is a computational problem. If you knew:

- Where everyone you might want to hang out with is

- What sort of hanging out they are up for; whether they'd like to hang out with you

- What the affordances are in each place for looking after kids (bathrooms, shade, food etc)

- How to get there and how much effort it is





Then you could, at a moment's notice, take your pick of several places to be, depending on how extroverted you felt, and how much energy you could devote to getting and staying there.





The app is called OUT. I open it up.   



  



It knows:

- Where I am (through my google location sharing)

- What commitments I have today (through my google calendar)

- What my babies' sleep schedules are like (either through Huckleberry or because the app asked)

- What modes of transport I have access to (cargo bike, walking, public transport, car) because I input that when I signed up





It also knows:

- Who I know, and what level of intimacy I have with them:

    - Old pal (easy, effortless, you feel like yourself and/or you get energy from spending time with them)

    - Friend (some energy required, but there's a bond there, and it can be energising and enjoyable as long as you aren't burnt out)

    - New friend (requires a bit more energy, still feeling each other out, want to get to know them better)

    - No category (people you have no reason to want to hang out with)





At any time I can add a new friend (or an old pal or friend who has just joined the app); by default they're added to the 'new friend' circle, but I can move them up into more intimate circles, and/or change my mind later (it doesn't get shown to them). 





The first thing I see when I open the app is a list of options, ranked by distance away, and tagged with the circle the people are in. Each option is listed alongside a brief suggestion about how to get there. So this could look like:

- meet Kate and Nick for storytime at the SF Central Library at 10:30am (leaving by 10am via bike).

- go to Duboce Park playground anytime before 1 (joining Anya and Arden and Yan and her new baby), biking 15 mins

- go to storytime at Eureka Valley library at 10am, and invite others (Erin and Cory are free), leaving walking by 9:30am or biking 9:45am

- go over to Eileen and Arthur's place; their door is open until 5 (biking 20 mins)





If none of these appeal to you, you can broadcast your own activity. Any recurring activities you want company at will be broadcast by default (say, you always go to Duboce Park playground 5-6pm after work on Thursdays).





You tell the app what you're doing. It will ask 'who would you like to share it with?' and give you options from old pals only, to 'everyone' which includes new friends as well. It will ask you how long you're doing this, and if you don't answer, it will set the default duration to 2 hours.





Once it is set, you have made an 'option' for others (whoever is in the circles you selected) that they can join if they want to.  You can always move people to further out circles; they will only see the activities you show to the circle they are in. 





Once someone has broadcast an option, in order to display it to others there is a process that converts it into natural language and also adds transport and schedule instructions. If the transport and schedule limitations are infeasible it will not be shown to them (say, if it's half an hour away and it would take them 30 mins to get to).





If I go to a particular option, the app will make sure to recommend that option to me or similar ones next time it is available (or rank them more highly amongst the options).
