I think McGilchrist is looking at deeper underlying things, though I'm not sure if he's looking at the same underlying thing you're looking at though! 

In any case, I highly recommend his work—has transformed my introspection.

2019-05-30 at 14:46:34: "pain" and "harm" are different words, but both get implied by the word "hurt", so when I use the word "hurt" I make a point of being clear internally what I'm actually talking about.

2019-05-29 at 22:23:41: @makoConstruct Yeah, there are ways of doing shoulding that don't tie people in knots...

(Basically (which is maybe what you're saying?) any should is a claim about how to achieve a particular end, and what gets busted is when the end is left off.)

2019-05-29 at 18:06:40: @QiaochuYuan @alifeofmovement &amp; huh, once we ask "what should we SHOW kids?" (vs "teach") it starts to ask something different of the "teachers".

2019-05-27 at 01:25:51: @dela3499 @EmmaJP9_ @Z_Jacobi 1. What popular opinion is of something
2. What's going to happen based on 1

These get confused by bad questions all the time: the % of Americans who wanted Donald Trump as president is way lower than the # who voted for him. Many saw him as best of two terrible options.

2019-05-27 at 01:05:49: @dela3499 @EmmaJP9_ @Z_Jacobi To be clear, this isn't arguing with what @dela3499 is saying; sometimes it makes sense to test something that many people think is a bad idea. 

My point is that it's important to be able to disambiguate between those two things.

2019-05-27 at 01:02:42: @dela3499 @EmmaJP9_ @Z_Jacobi pointed out to me a few months ago that any referendum about a complex decision needs to require way more than 50% of the vote to implement, because otherwise eg it can get 51% of the vote for "some brexit" but no given instantiation of brexit gets more than 30% support

2019-05-26 at 22:36:55: @eriktorenberg Relatedly, laughter &amp; control don't go together. If someone thinks we can only deal with serious things by controlling them, then laughter feels like a threat to that.

2019-05-26 at 22:35:53: @eriktorenberg Not sure! One thought is humor lives almost entirely in the right-hemisphere, and the world has become increasingly left-hemisphere-dominated over the last century.

Also humor+seriousness=paradox, and to LH, paradox means "one of these must go".

2019-05-26 at 22:30:42: @visakanv Aha! Not sure I'd seen this thread before but it's gold. I think I've been starting to learn some of these things from watching you do them, so it might be that 500 threads required for pioneering, but then the moves become more widely available.

2019-05-26 at 22:21:42: @visakanv @GRITCULT @i_amm_nobody I've started doing this as well! Could probably stand to do it more. 

There's "how do you get words in common so general searches return everything?" and "how do you get unique words so you can find something specific?"

(these constraints don't conflict that much)

2019-05-25 at 23:22:10: @Timber_22 Reflecting, I think half of the challenge is not just designing an OS for the RH, but removing RH-hostile modules from the LH. So it needs a major patch as well. But it's more "LH, learn to let go" and not "LH, learn to do these things"

2019-05-25 at 23:19:38: @Timber_22 Ha! Yes, definitely. It's actually basically an inevitability that the code will be faulty, because whether or not there's intentional deception, the RH is in general oriented towards things that lose their magic when talked about!

2019-05-25 at 22:59:34: Model: there are different cognitive OSes that run on different underlying architectures; recently the LHem architecture (linear, decoupled) got an upgrade that made it overpowered. Now we need a new OS for the RH architecture (nonlinear, contextual) so it can contain LH again.

2019-05-25 at 22:19:25: @Timber_22 Welcome back, apparently! Twitter's grown some fun new pieces since you were here last! I don't know much about you but here's an intro thread I made for someone else:
https://t.co/1j2LqAo69U

2019-05-25 at 21:27:25: @alifeofmovement I'm basically hearing this as a dialogue between the left hemisphere and right hemisphere, which...

...makes sense in the context of this as a spiritual lesson.
https://t.co/mNWeGZquhY

2019-05-25 at 21:26:06: @alifeofmovement Okay great we get to watch the self-consciousness defeating itself. This is delightful.

~"I tried to assert my dominance. He was winning."

2019-05-25 at 21:17:30: @alifeofmovement Okay this is much better in Chapter 2 now that he's actually playing out the dialogue rather than just talking about it.

2019-05-25 at 21:04:13: @alifeofmovement Currently listening to Chapter 1 of The Music Lesson and finding it very self-conscious. Does it get... less-so?

I'm enjoying the interplay of the music &amp; story though!

2019-05-25 at 17:02:01: @SlaytonBenjamin @visakanv That day he and I probably went through French, German, Russian, Spanish, Italian, Indian, Scottish, English... maybe 1-2 others.

2019-05-25 at 16:18:15: @DellAnnaLuca For any of these I highly recommend checking out Iain McGilchrist's book The Master and his Emissary, which talks extensively about the roles of the relationships between the R &amp; L hemispheres in learning, confabulation, decision-making. https://t.co/00MDjhIzEV

2019-05-24 at 05:11:49: @Conaw It would probably end up attracting followers anyway, but presumably fewer and they'd know what they were in for. And those followers' replies might help me develop my thoughts. Hmm... 🤔

2019-05-24 at 05:11:07: @Conaw It's occurring to me that except for concerns about saying things that land awkwardly (which is minor issue compared to context) it could actually work to have a public @​Malcolm_Scratchpad account or w/e, and then I can use tweets from there in this acct's threads organically!

2019-05-23 at 16:56:26: @visakanv @webdevMason And then a next phase, though dangerous, would be a system that automatically detects when someone has made an asshole reply to you, and puts them in the shadow-ban category *for* you.

For ++conversationality, it could not-do-this for anyone followed by someone you follow.

2019-05-23 at 16:54:34: @visakanv @webdevMason Nice. Makes me think that Twitter could use a personal-shadow-ban system, which is sort of like block except the user has no idea, but unlike mute it prevents any replies-from-them-to-you from showing up to your followers as well.

We don't, we call it a "patent application", or maybe a "patent".

2019-05-20 at 14:47:31: @visakanv From that same SSC post... even if I *did* go to Red Tribe America, I still would probably be almost entirely interacting with my friends, who aren't part of that culture.

And yet, as Visa's photos of the diffs between SF &amp; SG re drugs illustrate, the scene is still different. https://t.co/sfnvjQRBmm

2019-05-20 at 14:43:34: @visakanv (There are multiple things I'm saying in the previous tweet. One of them is that it seemed implied by the person's use of "America" that they were referencing Red Tribe America—which is the only one that calls *itself* America—whereas SF is very Blue/Grey)

2019-05-20 at 14:38:18: @visakanv (Answered Kinda)

I'm Canadian, and when I spent time in SF, people would ask me "what did you think of... America?" and I was like "I didn't go to "America", I went to SF".

The fractal subcultures of countries, cities, etc, make foreignness an odd thing to track.

2019-05-20 at 14:03:08: @rauchs @generativist Yep, very relevant. Someone made an app awhile ago called FeedHero (now defunct) that gave you access to twitter threads as if they were each chats, and you could archive them. This is one thing I'd want to include in my #TwitterReplacement concept.

2019-05-19 at 03:12:01: @danielharan Interestingly, this sort of suggests that if I wanted to spend $5000 on offsetting carbon, it might be higher impact to give it to a group that is researching new tech and needs a bit of cash to make it through some round of funding (grant or investment)

2019-05-19 at 03:10:48: @danielharan Gotcha, so basically buying one person's worth of carbon offsets is cheap, but buying a whole country's worth is impossible?

I sort of figured it was something like this... demand for "carbon offsets" as a product is low, so there's marginal stuff, but it's not denting...

2019-05-18 at 01:53:35: If carbon capture tech is so primitive, how are carbon offsets so cheap?

2019-05-17 at 16:26:58: 15/ It's not making sense for me to work on that full-time right now but I would love to play a strategy/design role to a #TwitterReplacement project that I resonate with. I've got a year's worth of notes on how I might approach it!

2019-05-17 at 16:26:57: 14/ My sense is that the overlap between those 10k people and the I.I. isn't total but is large—might be the perfect critical mass for this #TwitterReplacement concept I keep talking about. https://t.co/fCeQ2CxwlL

2019-05-17 at 16:26:57: 13/ @Conaw remarked that this new culture on twitter feels like "a new app, and max 10,000 people are using it." I asked:

https://t.co/Hr5SLh6RGp

2019-05-17 at 16:26:57: 12/ So what I'm most excited about regarding the I.I. is the co-creation that is happening. Which is currently including the co-creation of relationships, identity, community.

I'm looking forward to participating in that in whatever forms emerge for it—URL &amp; IRL.

2019-05-17 at 16:26:57: 11/ It's a fractal! I love how the structure of twitter inspires me to write this stuff up and pull it all together! I've barely blogged in a year but this context naturally makes me prolific!
https://t.co/4Kc6rzmcod

2019-05-17 at 16:26:56: 10/ I wrote a whole tweetstorm about this concept just now so I could share it in this tweetstorm about the I.I. thing:

https://t.co/whWhPa5M1C

2019-05-17 at 16:26:56: 9/ This intertwinglement is both obviously true, and remarkably easy to ignore.

https://t.co/MdWyMGXdl5

2019-05-17 at 16:26:56: 8/ The quality of my conversations with people on twitter is affected by their mood, which is affected by who else they're talking with on twitter, and how.

https://t.co/PaOiFggVAr

2019-05-17 at 16:26:56: 7/ The "this isn't just me" doesn't just mean "I'm not alone".

It also means "I can't take credit for how beautiful my corner of twitter is"

Obviously—I don't write all of the tweets.
Less obviously—my curation is part of a context of other people also curating.

2019-05-17 at 16:26:55: 6/ What Anna's post about @whatstheii made clear to me is that this isn't just me! I had already had a vague sense that a lot of the people I followed were following each other, but now a much larger sense of context around that.

2019-05-17 at 16:26:55: 5/ Since I'd had a twitter account through a half-dozen different life phases, this meant a lot of unfollowing (like 700).

(The app https://t.co/Oy9u216Kap is helpful for this)

https://t.co/2X6SSaxUpg

2019-05-17 at 16:26:54: 4/ Give your self-reflection a little twist and beautiful things can emerge!

(playing with this app, Fraksyl, and noticing how tiny changes were amplified into beautiful patterns, was actually part of the inspiration for my decision to get back on Twitter) https://t.co/qg8hqiPPY6

2019-05-17 at 16:26:54: 3/ I made a conscious decision in 2017 to get back on Twitter, inspired by a sense I had that if I tweaked my online behavior slightly, I could build all sorts of relationships with amazing people!

And that has worked 🥰 (and we're just getting started)

2019-05-16 at 20:37:22: @Conaw @ultimape @GRITCULT @visakanv @KevinSimler @vgr @context_ing (To be clear, "renounce" is prrrrooobably the wrong name for this feature 😉 And probably it would make sense to have an option to point any viewers of that tweet at a new one that clarifies.)

2019-05-16 at 20:36:17: @Conaw @ultimape @GRITCULT @visakanv @KevinSimler @vgr @context_ing Edit is doom because it means tweets lose their temporality, and makes it easier to become perfectionistic.

But having renounce gives an option instead of delete—supporting the idea that it's okay to learn and the past isn't shameful. Would require cultural differences too ofc!

2019-05-16 at 20:29:27: @Conaw @ultimape @GRITCULT @visakanv @KevinSimler @vgr @context_ing And sometimes rediscovering it is like 🤦. Like reading your old OKC answers and being like "I used to be a ______ist??"

Someone (can't find source) was suggesting no edit button (edit is doom) but an ability to renounce an old tweet, which makes a lot of sense to me!

2019-05-16 at 20:24:22: @Conaw @ultimape @GRITCULT @visakanv @KevinSimler @vgr @context_ing Visa has written about forgetting he wrote something—this is the nature of writing! And sometimes rediscovering it is like "wow!"

2019-05-16 at 19:43:51: @Conaw @ultimape @GRITCULT @visakanv @KevinSimler @vgr @context_ing If I make a tweetstorm about something, it doesn't have to be the be-all-end-all reference for a topic, it's just "what I thought about this at this time".

2019-05-16 at 19:41:40: @Conaw @ultimape @GRITCULT @visakanv @KevinSimler @vgr @context_ing One thing I'm unsure of, in all of this, is the role of time.

2019-05-16 at 18:01:18: 12/ To be clear, this doesn't mean I should feel guilty.

Guilt is a resource you can only play zero-sum or negative-sum games with, so as this thread talks about, it doesn't allow us to make more possible!

2019-05-16 at 18:01:17: 11/ "There is no away" is a slogan that's been used around environmentalism, instructing people to not throw things away, but it applies much more broadly.

2019-05-16 at 18:01:17: 10/ Wealth is a kind of negentropy, &amp; since entropy can't be destroyed, to create wealth I either need to dump my entropy elsewhere or get negentropy input.

Part of the context of a lot of wealth creation has been by externalizing costs, onto other individuals or the context.

2019-05-16 at 18:01:17: 9/ This applies at all scales—to me, &amp; to Bill Gates. What is possible is a function of context.

Sometimes this is exciting: those I tagged above are all stoked I'm using their tech for my app—that's what it's for! 🚀💞

2019-05-16 at 18:01:16: 6/ I haven't made a Wardley Map for Complice but if I did it would include @Heroku, @Stripe, @MongoDB, @Angular, @NodeJS, #WebRTC &amp; dozens of other programming modules.

2019-05-15 at 21:41:32: @AndJohnsonAnd I suggest making sure that at the very least you've decided exactly what you're going to work on today/next before diving in.

That in itself is a start, &amp; the clarity means the decision is "this thing" vs "game" (not "work" vs "game"). Sometimes "this thing" is more interesting!

2019-05-15 at 18:23:00: @Conaw This app, @Golden implies it would do this: "Mapping leading edges of knowledge — from the quark to the jaguar"

("leading edge" implies that it contains a bunch of unknowns &amp; questions; I realize that Golden may not do this, but it would be good!)

https://t.co/OWIJ16dfkP

2019-05-15 at 18:20:09: @Conaw What matters is on a different level of abstraction. "Compromise as toxic" can be an okay heuristic but the important questions are more like:
1) do you have a positive-sum &amp; positively correlated game?
2) is there any building feeling of resent or contempt?

2019-05-15 at 17:02:41: @aaronzlewis @peternlimberg @Meaningness Related, the idea that "meta" is necessarily missing the point. Sometimes it is! But also injunctions against meta are sometimes how existing power structures are maintained:

2019-05-15 at 05:49:40: And of course reply and lmk what your thoughts are on the name, on the cluster, the relationship between them, alternatives, meta-commentary...

2019-05-15 at 05:49:40: Might as well collect some information from everyone who's reading this.

This is obviously going to be oversimplified but go with your gut answer to both:

Are you in this #InterIntellect cluster &amp; what's your sense of that name?

2019-05-15 at 05:49:39: ...and I don't have an alternate name idea.🙃

In my head, I've been thinking of this cluster as being kind of meta-rational / meta-modern, but I'm guessing that those terms are somehow simultaneously too broad &amp; too narrow for what Anna's pointing at (in different dimensions)

2019-05-15 at 05:49:39: Whew, feels good to write that all out.

Again, I love the *referent* that Anna is pointing at here. It's me! It's my people! 🥰
(I'm not at the middle of this cluster but I am in it)

I wrote this whole tweetstorm because I'm hoping for a different signifier. https://t.co/hUe0tAi2Ir

2019-05-15 at 05:49:39: @yashkaf's comment on the original post illustrates this very confusion:

(And probably we need terms for both of these things! The rationality community represents a relatively successful precursor to what Anna &amp; other ii folks are trying to do here!)

https://t.co/CLizi0pvHn https://t.co/GlDUJJUBWd

2019-05-15 at 05:49:38: Yet indefinite article "an" suggests that there could be dozens or hundreds of inter-intellects out there. As if it means "a group of people who connect on the internet out of shared (meta)interests."

But then "The I.I." (eg @whatstheii) uses "the", implying there's just one! https://t.co/FAi2CNpOkH

2019-05-15 at 05:49:38: Anna uses the term as... a singular noun

&gt; "Why you probably belong to an inter-intellect and why this matters"

This suggests that I.I. is the name for the community, not someone in it... who is, I guess, an "inter-intellectual"? 🤨

2019-05-15 at 05:49:38: So those are some thoughts on the semantic aspects of why the term "inter-intellect" feels off to me. (The "inter" part is great. Everything is deeply intertwingled.)

As I thought about this more I noticed there are also syntactical reasons I find the term weird. https://t.co/2kQFOqqVXq

2019-05-15 at 05:49:37: Anyway, while Anna and others might not mean so narrow a thing by "intellect", my concern is the connotation might be strong enough that it creates an attractor for the (many!) ppl who are committed to an intellect-only mode-of-being, even if initial #InterIntellect folks aren't!

2019-05-15 at 05:49:37: ^ that podcast is a fantastic intro to the topic in under 45 minutes. I'm planning to do some sort of write-up of it, but that hasn't happened yet. When I do it'll be here:
https://t.co/tVVfQu9zmB

2019-05-15 at 05:49:37: (If you haven't seen my earlier tweets on this, I'm not talking about the hypey personality-typey hemispheres models from 60s split-brain experiments. McGilchrist has done a ton of research and has a new model based on how each hemisphere attends.)

Intro: https://t.co/LSjHNdaYct

2019-05-15 at 05:49:37: The context I shared that in earlier is in a thread about the right &amp; left hemispheres, as understood through Iain McGilchrist's new model.

Anna's blog post about inter-intellect mentions integrating both hemispheres, but the term "intellect" maps very directly onto the left🧠 https://t.co/FX4kOaXwq5

2019-05-15 at 05:49:36: I shared these pages earlier today, which begin "This is not to say that there is no place for intellect — it is a valuable capacity ... the problem with intellect is that we use it to distract ourselves from direct experience ... to judge perception as good, bad, or indifferent" https://t.co/5RbMCA1SbD

2019-05-15 at 05:49:36: And my sense is that the associations with the term "intellect" are sufficiently far from the central core engine of what connects these people, that it'll lead us astray if we try to rally around it.

Might take a few years, but this sort of thing happens—by default, not rarely.

2019-05-15 at 05:49:36: I've written about how when naming nuanced things, it's important to chose terms that people won't think they already understand, and that won't distort attempts to further clarify the concept.

https://t.co/H7MlqbPt1E

2019-05-15 at 05:49:35: The deeper thing for me with this #InterIntellect thing is that I think the name that has been chosen is likely to create a rallying flag that sooner or later becomes an attractor that's not what we want! 😨 https://t.co/SrcGxNeMPi

2019-05-15 at 05:49:35: And... a lot of me feels sad/scared. Took me a bit of introspection and poking around more to figure out why!

There are a few subtle reasons related to confusion around why the article was constructed how it was, particularly things about the polls, and that's part of it.

2019-05-15 at 05:49:35: I am definitely in this cluster! And I've been noticing the cluster as it's been appearing, from my perspective.

A small part of me feels excited that this is being pointed at more clearly, so that people can connect around it!
https://t.co/yaxbtCdQ0j

2019-05-15 at 05:49:35: She calls it the "inter-intellect". Here's another take:

https://t.co/r7OzjY3irX

2019-05-15 at 05:49:35: Summary: Anna has identified a cluster of people constellating online around some similar themes, broadly:
- weird, curious &amp; openminded
- kind &amp; postpartisan
- self-directed doers
- well-rounded
- non-judgmental
- big picture thinkers
- age-agnostic
- want connection &amp; community

2019-05-15 at 05:49:34: I read this piece by @TheAnnaGat on the #InterIntellect/@whatstheii and have thoughts &amp; feelings on the subject, that I want to share!

2019-05-15 at 04:31:12: Oh and of course this one today that basically concludes that tantric non-dual awareness enlightenment is basically synonymous with getting your left hemisphere to let your right hemisphere run the show.

https://t.co/73SEHWJOK6

2019-05-15 at 03:21:09: @Conaw This is relevant because I think some of most fascinating interdependencies in this tree aren't known until solved. In this case:

Psychiatrist spends 20 years aggregating schizophrenic &amp; stroke cases, &amp; studies of birds; result helps people realize non-dual awareness.

What.

2019-05-15 at 03:18:24: @Conaw Also yesterday I discovered there's a startlingly clear &amp; important relationship between tantric enlightenment &amp; brain hemispheres. 🤯

I'm surely not the first to sense this, but the impact of these models connecting has barely been felt yet at *all*.

https://t.co/73SEHWJOK6

2019-05-15 at 03:15:06: @Conaw Yeah it seems like this would also help point people at Hamming Problems. It could include not just interdependencies but also what real-world impact various discoveries would have!

2019-05-14 at 20:01:02: Here's my first, where I intro'd the concept briefly and noted that a bunch of learning challenges get confusing because we try to teach our left hemisphere how to do things our right hemisphere already knows. Instead, LH needs to learn to let RH work.

2019-05-14 at 19:13:56: @uncatherio @ben_r_hoffman Yes yes yes yes yes this.

2019-05-14 at 19:08:50: @ben_r_hoffman The attractor is definitely not what I want, &amp; I'm pretty sure it's not the attractor that the people at the center of the cluster want either.

If I didn't care I could just let it do its thing.

But I'm within the gravitational pull of this nascent attractor, so I'm like fuckkk

2019-05-14 at 19:05:44: @ben_r_hoffman Okay, after reflecting on this for an entire half-hour, I have a conclusive conclusion! 😉

It's not that it was prematurely reified, it's that I really really really don't like the term chosen. I think it's fairly likely that the term chosen will create a terrible attractor. https://t.co/mNZ0reT3Te

2019-05-14 at 18:53:44: @ben_r_hoffman Obvi it would be way different for dozens of reasons. And I already see within this new thing (whatever it is) a cluster of very purpose-driven people and a cluster of people mostly attracted to it as a social thing. Not a problem, *and* can produce tension around group identity.

2019-05-14 at 18:51:56: @ben_r_hoffman In a sense he was &amp; in a sense he did, and this ∥ thing might head somewhere similar.

When I stare at this post and imagine a few years in the future, some outcomes are similar to the Bay Area Rationality situation (which brings up all sorts of feels 😄😐🤓😤👽😣😜😟😍😢🤔)

2019-05-14 at 18:42:09: @ben_r_hoffman Mmmm, yeah, that resonates. And as you said, the Medium muddles the message.

2019-05-14 at 18:39:28: @ben_r_hoffman A big part of my weird feeling while reading it was from the polls. They're all separate questions, so they shine no light on whether there are distinct clusters in the space, and they ask "is X important in our community?" which I only know inasmuch as I've a sense of the whole.

2019-05-14 at 18:36:14: @ben_r_hoffman Relatedly, @dthorson said on an emerge episode some months ago (maybe with @peternlimberg?) there's this sense of something that isn't doing tribalism, but is a cluster. And they talked about the idea of the term "fellowship" for it, or something.

https://t.co/h0umCv0iYr

2019-05-14 at 18:33:12: @ben_r_hoffman I've had an implicit sense of there being a sort of cluster on Twitter I've been connecting with for the last year or two, but I'd been thinking about it primarily in terms of meta-rationalist / meta-modernist.

Seems that's a different but overlapping cluster!

2019-05-14 at 18:30:20: @ben_r_hoffman Hmm, based on a lot of inexplicit stuff I'm aware of, I'm pretty sure it's not a scam.

That said, the tone of that particular article rubs my hair a little backward. I resonate with all of the dimensions, so maybe it just feels prematurely reified? Nah, that's not quite it...

2019-05-14 at 18:25:48: @TheAnnaGat Huh, I resonate a lot with most of the things and am at least neutral on the others...

...and I can't help but think: how are you going to actually find clusters of people if you put all of your polling questions separately!?

2019-05-13 at 19:20:18: @benlandautaylor And yet I haven't gone to the dentist in awhile, because I'm meaning to sign up for private insurance again and haven't gotten around to it. If I'd known it would have taken me this long to sign up for private insurance, I'd have gone to the dentist already. But that's... 🤷

2019-05-13 at 19:19:20: @benlandautaylor I think that the last thing sort of makes sense due to human irrationalities:

There's sort of a short-term incentive to get private insurance because it takes the sting out of eye/dental care, without having to do think about major actual emergencies.

2019-05-13 at 19:17:18: @benlandautaylor Oddly, Canada has a bunch of this weirdness too (inherited from USA?)

Eg like most Ontarians, I have an OHIP card (Ontario Health Insurance Plan) which I present to the doctor for routine card, not just emergencies.

Then I need private insurance to cover routine eye/dental.

2019-05-13 at 19:13:02: @QiaochuYuan @mattgoldenberg @sulphuroxide ...now I find myself wondering if the crux of this difference might be "emptiness" vs "beyond emptiness" that @Meaningness points at in this vivid post...

2019-05-13 at 00:18:15: @reasonisfun @meditationstuff One way I think about this is that Deutsch's model of static &amp; dynamic societies says nothing about the transition phase, which is a third whole thing altogether.

2019-05-13 at 00:05:56: @meditationstuff @lou_keep I think main issue was just that you started with @vgr's call for summaries, so for people who didn't know that you'd already written one it seemed like this was your entry.

If your 1st/2nd tweet had "that article inspired some further thoughts..." then it would have felt clear!

2019-05-13 at 00:02:31: @garybasin @Conaw I would do it with a paid subscription, so that user interests &amp; biz interests are aligned. Could have a long trial though or use quadratic pricing up to a point, to gain initial critical mass.

&amp; growth via limited invite, so network of "ppl I want to talk to"

2019-05-12 at 23:59:43: @garybasin @Conaw This would therefore not be able to replace the value of twitter as a way to interact with THE WHOLE FREAKING WORLD ALL AT ONCE...

...but it would be 10-100× better for having discussions among dozens of interested-&amp;-interesting people, and exploring ideas.

2019-05-12 at 23:57:56: @garybasin @Conaw Nah tha's the most important part of this thread 🙃

There's two parts of network effects. One way to bootstrap getting any traction at all is to interlink tightly with actual-Twitter at the start. The app would xpost to twitter

Then there's how to grow huge. And I'd rather not!

2019-05-12 at 23:55:36: @garybasin @QiaochuYuan @fortelabs @dthorson Although I think that the actual desired state isn't best called success NOR happiness but something more like "flow" or "wu wei":

= acting in each moment in a way that makes deep sense to an integrated whole of one's desires and big-picture purpose.

2019-05-12 at 23:50:33: Yep, checks out:
     rhizome     = raɪzoʊm
     eyes roam = aɪz roʊm

(different in a British accent; not sure if it still works bc can't find IPA for "rhizome" in British accent. eyes roam becomes "aɪz rəʊm")

2019-05-12 at 23:45:38: (Aside: phonetic anagram seems like a cool concept. I think the closest term is a spoonerism (which Rhizome: Eyes Roam structurally is) but there's cool stuff to be found elsewhere here. Repurpose the phonemes but don't worry about the letters. Translate to IPA then anagram?)

2019-05-12 at 23:45:38: ...thinking that "rhizome" would make a cool name for the #TwitterReplacement concept I've been thinking about but it's terrible onomastically bc it's hard to spell &amp; not unique.

Then realized @Conaw's related project Roam is part of a phonetic anagram of Rhizome: Eyes Roam👁👁

2019-05-12 at 23:38:31: @garybasin @QiaochuYuan @fortelabs And @dthorson has described MAPLE's awakening training as being able to produce "sustainable happiness, regardless of circumstances" (from memory)

The idea that this is impossible comes from confusing happiness with success: https://t.co/skjfdgxxeU

2019-05-12 at 23:37:23: @garybasin @QiaochuYuan @fortelabs I think that when people think they're pursuing happiness, what they actually mean is "I WANT OUT" from the endless internal conflict where nothing they do satisfies all of their strategies.

https://t.co/dY99um1ZGJ

2019-05-12 at 23:31:30: @garybasin @QiaochuYuan @fortelabs Therefore all of life becomes strenuous, even fun things. ("I should be studying/writing/working/exercising/sleeping!")

Speaking of tensions between fun, studying/writing, and sleeping... I wrote an article describing an impossible bind of those:

2019-05-12 at 23:29:15: @garybasin @QiaochuYuan @fortelabs What uses negative effort is doing whatever seems like it will achieve all of your goals (in PCT terms "close all the errors between your reference levels &amp; perceptions").

However, most ppl are traumatized bundles of conflicting goals &amp; strategies. So there exists no such path.

2019-05-12 at 23:25:06: @garybasin @QiaochuYuan PCT clearly clearly answers the question of "why are some things easier to do than not do?" ...that @fortelabs asked for examples of awhile ago:
https://t.co/DqzsreNo7e

2019-05-12 at 23:24:10: @garybasin @QiaochuYuan Although we all have a few core thermostats that are very hard to reset or abandon indefinitely: food, thirst, pain, connection, meaning.

So eventually the person who has resigned themselves to loneliness usually tries something new, and can't help it even though fearing hope.

2019-05-12 at 23:22:20: @garybasin @QiaochuYuan Reorganization means trying a different strategy, on some level of abstraction. Abandoning some lower-level goal and trying something else in service of the same higher level goal. Or maybe the goal in question is abandoned: "maybe I'm just doomed to be lonely"

2019-05-12 at 23:21:26: @garybasin @QiaochuYuan There's a whole hierarchical network of these control systems (think thermostats).

Tinder mightn't solve your loneliness, but as long as it feels like it might and you don't feel safe experimenting with something else, you'll do it. Fail long enough, reorganization occurs.

2019-05-12 at 23:19:42: @garybasin @QiaochuYuan More generally, discussion of "want" is aided enormously by a general understanding of Perceptual Control Theory: that people are moving around closing various gaps between some reference level &amp; some perceived level of something:

Too cold → put on sweater.
Lonely → tinder.

2019-05-12 at 23:15:55: @garybasin @QiaochuYuan One variant I like is "success is getting what you want and happiness is wanting what you get"

(Still doesn't answer define want!)

2019-05-12 at 23:13:08: RT @QiaochuYuan: Have a friend who puts it this way: happiness is what you feel when you're getting what you want. So wanting to feel happy…

2019-05-12 at 23:10:00: @visakanv Speaking of essays, one I wrote awhile ago talking about some related stuff:

https://t.co/1aUqEruTRU

2019-05-12 at 23:04:19: @Conaw @QiaochuYuan @uncatherio @visakanv This raises the really interesting question of "if someone were trying to build a #TwitterReplacement that was made for this new thing, would it be best to do it now while the number of people using it in this new way is small enough?"

2019-05-12 at 23:00:05: @visakanv @QiaochuYuan @kevinakwok @KevinSimler @backus @nayafia I think the core question is maybe "are you holding in awareness the parts of it that can't be seen from a given angle?" but maybe people mostly don't actually even know what can be seen from a given angle... https://t.co/aukG9FOYM9

2019-05-12 at 16:10:15: @meditationstuff @vgr summarized this very powerfully with the concept of Fourth Worlds:

"The lament that the United States is turning into a third-world country is at once too pessimistic and too optimistic."

And that here's Mark's actual attempted summary:

2019-05-12 at 15:59:15: @meditationstuff @vgr @lou_keep What of this 73-tweet storm is purely a summary of @lou_keep's article, and what is further commentary by Mark?

(This tweetstorm blew my mind so I'm probably gonna just go read the original anyway, but I figured it would be worth voicing this question.)

2019-05-10 at 13:52:54: Listening to the playlist generated by my Likes and really digging a song, which would ordinarily cause me to Like it but... it's already Liked.

And I'm sad but I'm like "well I guess that makes sense as a technical limitation" but... wait.

Why _not_ allow boosting song-Like?

2019-05-09 at 22:14:07: @kevinakwok I'm not sure exactly what's going on here, but for me it was harder and I suspect that's because my sense of what's present is mediated by the sense that while my eyes are closed I could reach out and touch it all. I guess I should test while standing in a more open area...

2019-05-09 at 22:12:49: @kevinakwok Test idea for distinguishing between visualization &amp; spatialization!

Consider the scene in front of you. Close your eyes. Imagine that scene. Turn around (eyes still closed). Is it harder or easier to imagine that original scene? (/ more or less detailed)

2019-05-09 at 22:08:47: @kevinakwok Like there's a gestalt sense and the sense is lighting up a lot of your visual system without any particular thing within it being particularly distinct or detailed.

2019-05-09 at 22:07:33: Excellent article about little 1-person experiments to test phenomenogical processes for things like counting seconds. https://t.co/HvjkaGI1X4

2019-05-09 at 22:06:13: @kevinakwok Another weird hypothesis: visualizing abstract things like a red star is (unexpectedly!?) harder for people with medium visualization ability than visualizing whole scenes.

2019-05-09 at 21:46:10: @Conaw Internal conflict has been a major topic for me for a couple of years. Here's various tweets of mine about it:

https://t.co/FdfIp7F9Sl

2019-05-09 at 21:44:14: RT @Conaw: Related: many (past self included) believe deep down that forcing themselves to do things through "willpower" is something they…

2019-05-09 at 21:42:44: @Conaw So much resonance with this.

Part of what reinforces this commitment to forcing oneself is that the whole thing is a battle between an inner "goodself" &amp; "badself". Both maintain their need to exist on the basis of the other.

2019-05-09 at 21:37:41: @dailectic @KevinSimler @The_Lagrangian @sonyaellenmann Also there's evidence that singing as a group activity evolved before denotative language, which this whole thing dovetails well with!

(Not sure of original source; I got it from Iain McGilchrist's 💯 book The Master and his Emissary)

2019-05-09 at 21:34:53: @dailectic @KevinSimler @The_Lagrangian @sonyaellenmann Wow this is really fascinating. I tried imagining being a lion eating something and seeing that haka, and I was very much like "fuck this shit I'm out".

https://t.co/1ymCCuhjFw

2019-05-09 at 21:29:22: @SarahAMcManus Yeah! I think the confusion here was caused by 2 things:

1) Friston's theory set out to explain perception, not behavior, so it chose weird words for everything compared to PCT https://t.co/kvGFgNDxS1

2) Friston himself hates surprise, so generalizing that seemed reasonable: https://t.co/oqOZfxexrL

2019-05-09 at 21:25:19: @JamesClear @reasonisfun Goodhart's Law is one reason: "When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure."

Punishing &amp; rewarding kids causes them to attempt to convince you they're doing what you want, rather than actually doing it. "Don't get caught" &amp; "Guess the teacher's password"

2019-05-09 at 21:21:07: @Meaningness @jamesheathers I just read this article and... wow. Very epic take-down of a bunch of genomics &amp; related stuff. Both of you will probably want to have a look.

2019-05-09 at 20:57:27: @SarahAMcManus @utotranslucence @raelifin Ultimately there's a ton of distinctions that *can* be made and most of them aren't that important. @fortelabs once posited "there is no such thing as "group knowledge"" and I responded with 8 such things. But they don't all need their own word.
https://t.co/F4QdyKmfzu

2019-05-09 at 20:56:26: @SarahAMcManus @utotranslucence @raelifin And let the writing process interplay with the word-making process. Use some placeholder words. Once you're sick of them, change them. Notice what distinctions you want to be able to make, and make them. Read the article out loud (&amp; share it with me!) to feel into the words more.

2019-05-09 at 20:54:36: @SarahAMcManus @utotranslucence @raelifin So... twas delightful to get this chance to write all of this up and think through it a bit more than I did originally 2y ago, but I don't actually have any answers for you!

I'm a strong believer in neologizing though, so I encourage you to write the article with some new words!

2019-05-09 at 20:29:16: @SarahAMcManus @utotranslucence But afaict (#Lojban twitter / @raelifin feel free to correct me on this!) Lojban didn't take the obvious-to-me step of actually turning all of these lovely distinctions (individual, mass, set, joint) into standard pronouns!

Not that it would directly help English if they had!

2019-05-09 at 20:23:49: @SarahAMcManus @utotranslucence This page lays out a ton of this in more detail, including another joiner (ce'o) that makes an ordered list, and one ("jo'u") that means "considered jointly" which is probably more of what @utotranslucence is looking for in her article about relationship

https://t.co/Y0NKyra5Rl https://t.co/p44kHNwmtR

2019-05-09 at 20:18:22: @SarahAMcManus @utotranslucence This page on plurals is hard to read but is getting closer to what we're looking for. It distinguishes between different joiner words that have different effects. "joi" creates a mass whereas "ce" creates a set.

Okay, that seems about right!

https://t.co/Wxwi4xDaGr https://t.co/5hPLxM5U1r

2019-05-09 at 20:08:27: @SarahAMcManus @utotranslucence They also distinguish between masses &amp; sets (https://t.co/pZKSVvKjZL) where a mass inherits properties from its individuals whereas the properties of a set refer to things like its count or its membership.

This is vaguely relevant and interesting, but not particularly helpful.

2019-05-09 at 20:05:56: @SarahAMcManus @utotranslucence So all of this brings us to Lojban. Which, of course, has thought a bit about this. This page describes how lojban essentially has some extra-fancy articles that let you distinguish masses &amp; groups-of-individuals.

2019-05-09 at 19:57:41: @SarahAMcManus @utotranslucence (Not to mention the ambiguity of inclusive &amp; exclusive "we" there.

As a kid, I was regularly told "we want to go for a hike" and I complained "not fair! the 'we' that wants and the 'we' that hikes are different!" I guess I've been thinking about pronoun ambiguity for awhile...)

2019-05-09 at 19:56:20: @SarahAMcManus @utotranslucence And yet, like @utotranslucence, I find myself still dissatisfied, because am I really going to say things like this...?

"We need to cothink about where to cotravel on our coholiday"

2019-05-09 at 19:53:09: @SarahAMcManus @utotranslucence So we've got "co-" (which in Latin also had "com-", "con-", "col-", &amp; "cor-", depending on the next letter, though only "co-" is still "forming" in pedantic English.) https://t.co/Jch1s4hrrD

&amp; "co-" is great! It lets us form some new verbs &amp; nouns to talk about collectivity.

2019-05-09 at 19:48:19: @SarahAMcManus @utotranslucence Despite a few exceptions, this works remarkably well in a lot of situations, both verbs and noun roles!

And has resulted in the coining of some new terms, like "cosleep", which means "sleep together, in the literal/boring sense". (If you try to corrupt this, 🖕)

2019-05-09 at 19:45:53: RT @utotranslucence: @skybrian The problem (and this is what I was scratching at before) is that I want two separate words for:

2019-05-09 at 19:43:54: @SarahAMcManus @utotranslucence @skybrian Okay, back to the drawing board. Part of my original inspiration was thinking about the prefix "co-", which seems to effectively point at this... usually.
"We're thinking" vs "We're co-thinking"
"They're authors" vs "They're co-authors"

...yet "coworking spaces" are solo.

2019-05-09 at 19:39:08: @SarahAMcManus @utotranslucence @skybrian However, this is just a reflexive pronoun. It doesn't actually work in most situations. So while it's cute (and many kids/people have derived it) and Sarah &amp; I use it to talk about ourchothers...

...it doesn't answer the fundamental question of how to point at groupness.

2019-05-09 at 19:36:46: @SarahAMcManus @utotranslucence @skybrian However, this still doesn't answer the puzzle of how to point at the whole.
"We like ourselves"
"We like each other"
"We like [us]"? 🤔

You can kind of use "us" but it's meh. Then I was inspired by a parent who shared her ~2yo's phrase "ourchothers". It's an intertwingled mix!

2019-05-09 at 19:32:40: @SarahAMcManus @utotranslucence @skybrian English also does have something helpful, which is the difference between "(our|your|them)selves" and "each other"! Both essentially reflexive pronouns, but one indicates individual and the other reciprocal.

"wash yourselves" is very different from "wash each other"

("go f—"🤣)

2019-05-09 at 19:29:31: @SarahAMcManus @utotranslucence @skybrian What does English already have?

Well, it's got the words "each" and "all". Since I was looking for "we" words (not "you") I thought about using "weach" and "wyall" but these seemed cumbersome plus they don't scale because "y'all" is already a thing and doesn't disambiguate.

2019-05-09 at 19:25:36: @SarahAMcManus @utotranslucence @skybrian Yeah! I was grappling with exactly this challenge a couple of years ago and was also curious about lojban at this time, so looked there for some inspiration. Found a bit but nothing conclusive, and in any case one ultimately needs to port it to English.

2019-05-09 at 19:09:19: @paraschopra @sia_steel Language is one major form of thinking, but not the only form. (This doesn't contradict the bigger point you're making)

If thinking were purely (heh) language, how could you have a tip-of-my-tongue sense? How could you know the meaning, but not the word?

2019-05-09 at 19:02:49: @SarahAMcManus @kevinakwok @KevinSimler @backus @nayafia Reading this tweet I spontaneously felt a sense of how it feels to be holding your face gently in my hands.

I wonder if we spent a bunch of time with you touching my face if you could develop an embodied sense of familiarity with how it feels? Or if you already have some?

2019-05-09 at 19:01:17: @theblanchard @then_there_was @azrirashid Wait, so yeah, no. The thing I had concluded wasn't "Prescription glasses cause blurry vision." but "Staring at things up close a lot causes chronic short-sightedness" (not genetics).

2019-05-09 at 19:00:02: @theblanchard @then_there_was @azrirashid But I guess I hadn't fully thought through the implications... that it could be fixed... that prescription glasses would actually make it worse... etc.

2019-05-09 at 18:59:12: @theblanchard @then_there_was @azrirashid Also, curiously, I had kind of assumed your original 🔥-take needed to be true, because otherwise why would nerds end up with glasses and athletes not? (Plus the stuff about obvi it would be maladaptive for huge % of pre-book populations to go shortsighted in childhood)

2019-05-09 at 18:56:48: @theblanchard @then_there_was @azrirashid Probably more time outdoors than most people but not a lot. These days I spend a large fraction of my time in in-person conversation with people. And I guess a decent amount of time reading on my phone, which I imagine doesn't help.

2019-05-09 at 18:55:54: @theblanchard @then_there_was @azrirashid My time varies; lots of time in front of a computer, and I usually wear glasses on computer-heavy days rather than contacts because it's slightly comfier &amp; peripheral vision is moot.

I have a standing desk and my screen is 2-2½ feet (~60-75cm) away from my face. Probably helps.

2019-05-09 at 18:52:37: @kevinakwok @KevinSimler @backus @nayafia Relatedly, the first time I tried to use Method of Loci, instead of imagining walking through my childhood home and seeing various objects, I was sort of picturing the house from the outside—again, like an architectural blueprint—and inserting the objects in the rooms.

2019-05-09 at 18:50:36: @kevinakwok @KevinSimler @backus @nayafia Ah yeah, this seems to me to be like my spatialization/propriozation thing.

Because I could kind of imagine holding the shape in the dark and rotating it, and I can do all of that without seeing it. I'd be very curious to know if anybody can't.

2019-05-09 at 18:49:17: @QiaochuYuan @kevinakwok @KevinSimler @backus @nayafia Oooh I've had that once or two! In the clearest case I can recall, it also involved a visual but when I remember it it was also partially a sense of where the person was standing. Very weird as I knew I was wearing an eyemask.

2019-05-09 at 18:46:27: @DellAnnaLuca @kevinakwok @KevinSimler @backus @nayafia Relatedly, I have a friend who is 100% aphantasic unless they're on psychedelics, in which case they can close their eyes and imagine things quite readily. So obviously that neural circuitry is there (it's probably literally necessary for sight) but is ordinarily inhibited.

2019-05-09 at 18:44:56: @DellAnnaLuca @kevinakwok @KevinSimler @backus @nayafia Totally. It'll be interesting to see what training for this emerges as it becomes better-known.

I think it'll surprise people by being less about learning to DO something and more about learning to NOT INHIBIT the part that naturally does it.

2019-05-09 at 06:02:08: @kevinakwok @KevinSimler @backus @nayafia Propriozation? Hmm 🤔

The next closest sense seems like echolocation, which we think of as being like sight but consider that sound bounces around corners in ways that light totally doesn't, and there's no color or visual-texture (you can tell how soft things are tho probably)

2019-05-09 at 06:00:08: @kevinakwok @KevinSimler @backus @nayafia It's very distinct from visualization. The most obvious sense it connects with isn't touch (which would again be more textural) but proprioception. It feels like my knowledge of how my hometown is shaped is similar to reaching over to turn on a familiar lightswitch in the dark.💡

2019-05-09 at 05:56:31: @kevinakwok @KevinSimler @backus @nayafia If I mentally bring up my hometown, the immediate thing that springs to mind is a sense of main street sweeping down past the theatre with my house atop the hill. I feel the whole shape at once in my head. But there's no weather or time of year. It's an architectural blueprint.

2019-05-09 at 05:54:15: @kevinakwok @KevinSimler @backus @nayafia I do this by default when "imagining". So when people say "imagine a dog in a field" then ask what color it is, or what color is the sky, my response is "well I hadn't given it any texture, it was just a 3D shape. I can tell you how big the dog was and how it was posed"

2019-05-09 at 05:49:35: @kevinakwok @KevinSimler @backus @nayafia My visualization in the original poll started at #1, but I could get it to go towards #6 by persisting.

I have a huge capacity for something I call spatialization, which is like visualization but for shapes, not sight. It's not directly sensory...

2019-05-06 at 17:54:22: @metamodels1 One fun thing about music is that you can rewrite a song whose tune/vibe you love, to make the lyrics more resonant with my current meaningness.

2019-05-06 at 17:44:11: Didn't make much further progress that night, but did really enjoy being outside and singing while the sun went down.

My current sense is that what I want to focus on is making &amp; enjoying space for the muse to show up and not worrying about what happens any given time.

2019-05-06 at 17:23:16: @cosimia_ There's more leverage in meme-propagation than in gene-propagation, especially when you consider marginal impact.

Which is not to say you shouldn't have kids either. Just that I think it's totally coherent to support life-flourishing without 3D-printing your own humans.

2019-05-06 at 17:19:47: @cognazor @KeenDisregard @dthorson (This tweetstorm I just wrote has been gradually brewing since I read The Beginning of Infinity months ago, and further evolving as I've taken in this stuff about collapse, with yet further developments as I learn more about McGilchrist's brain lateralization model.)

2019-05-06 at 17:18:31: @cognazor @KeenDisregard @dthorson "Perhaps-inevitable" is so so so different from "99% likely" or "near-certain" or anything like that. It recognizes that we're in a complex system with huge dynamics and things might already be inevitable but also we can't know that for sure either!

2019-05-06 at 17:17:21: @cognazor @KeenDisregard I really like how @dthorson phrased this in the intro to a recent Making Sense Of episode of Emerge with him &amp; Bonnitta Roy: "perhaps-inevitable near-term collapse".

"Perhaps-Inevitable" is a beautiful phrase. It points so powerfully at the limitations of our knowledge &amp; power.

2019-05-06 at 17:13:03: @cognazor @KeenDisregard But we might! Holding that uncertainty is incredibly challenging.

I've been taking in Jem Bendell's writing &amp; speaking about Near-term Inevitable Collapse, and I love its focus on preparing not just logistically but psychologically for such a future... and... it's still certain.

2019-05-06 at 17:10:14: @cognazor @KeenDisregard And solar storms are just one thing!

So, I resonate deeply with DD's message that the only way out is through. We can't go back. We can't build a sustainable civilization just by recycling.

And... just because the only way out is through doesn't mean we'll find that way out.

2019-05-06 at 17:04:17: @cognazor @KeenDisregard And... people are working on this! → https://t.co/qirnKNZzC2

But did you know people were working on it? Do you know how much progress they've made? Do you know whether we'd be fucked if a huge solar storm happened next week? ☀

2019-05-06 at 17:02:25: @cognazor @KeenDisregard On a much larger scale, a solar storm could knock out huge sections of the power grid, and there aren't enough replacement transformers to just swap them in.

How to build replacements if power is out everywhere? How long would that take? What would be lost in the meantime?

2019-05-06 at 16:57:23: @cognazor @KeenDisregard Your phone is a complicated system though—we can easily model what it would cost to fix (ie replace).

&amp; yet if it were an old model not being manufactured any more and with no good used ones for sale, it might actually cost you 10-100 times as much to get a perfect replacement.

2019-05-06 at 16:50:41: @cognazor @KeenDisregard This is issue #2, above. In nonlinear systems, it's sometimes possible to use a tiny amount of energy to produce a change that takes a million times as much energy/info/effort to reverse.

This isn't rare, it's the usual case.

Don't believe me? Drop your phone onto concrete.

2019-05-06 at 16:48:23: @cognazor @KeenDisregard In complex systems (including interpersonal relations, intergovernmental relations, and biology on all scales from tiny organisms to biospheres) by the time you've understood the system well enough to control it, it has already changed. Needs an improvisational approach.

2019-05-06 at 16:47:15: @cognazor @KeenDisregard Speaking of systems that are hard to predict, The Beginning of Infinity, like most rationalist/modernist takes, tends towards seeing all systems as complicated systems, ie ones that if you think about long enough you can figure them out and control them.

2019-05-06 at 16:46:10: @cognazor @KeenDisregard This transition phase has properties that are different from the static society and different from the dynamic society, and in ways that are probably hard to predict because it's happening at a boundary, rather than within a given system.

2019-05-06 at 16:45:11: @cognazor @KeenDisregard Re 1, our society is observably dynamic &amp; that's why we can have humanity-scale existential risks. However, globally, we're still more in-transition than we are *in* the new way-of-thinking. "Schools are for training thinking" is still an ideal, not real

https://t.co/iz4kw74oiY

2019-05-06 at 16:41:46: @cognazor @KeenDisregard I don't think David disagrees factually with what I've said, but his treatment of it conveys a sense of "don't worry" that seems naïve to me. Naïve for two reasons:
1. we're still mid static→dynamic society transition
2. lack of understanding of complexity &amp; nonlinear dynamics

2019-05-06 at 16:39:43: @cognazor @KeenDisregard Yeah, reading the book I got the sense that other people reading it might think "ah yeah, people are gonna figure everything out" without accounting for the fact that this might not happen, for various reasons. It might, but you can't take that for granted!

2019-05-05 at 03:17:45: Just came across a snippet about schizophrenia &amp; art &amp; magic that seemed worth adding to this thread: https://t.co/SDCRO2PHF1

2019-05-05 at 00:17:31: I guess I'll see if I can get back in touch with that feeling! 🙃

And I guess since I'm already writing about how fear inhibits thinking &amp; learning, maybe I can incorporate this into the song! 🎶

2019-05-05 at 00:15:59: Probably the biggest thing is that at some point I became a bit self-conscious about my songs and wanted them to be really good, and the perfectionism has made it harder to start and to finish.

Was easier when I was just happy to have created something at all.

2019-05-05 at 00:14:03: I've also barely written any songs in years, which might be affecting me in multiple ways:
1. My songwriting muscle has atrophied somewhat
2. I have a backlog of things-to-sing that makes it harder to distill "what do I want THIS song to be about?"

2019-05-05 at 00:10:37: Songwriting has gotten substantially harder as my thoughts and feelings have gotten more complex.

2019-05-04 at 04:38:19: The implications of this for effective thinking in our (post)modern world that overemphasizes left-hemisphere thinking are enormous—each person's LH needs to learn to trust their RH. Turns out this basically feels like surrendering to god, since RH is incomprehensible to LH

2019-05-04 at 04:38:19: That is, previously the two hemispheres had been more integrated, but with increasing capacity for each in their own way to stand back more, suddenly the thoughts of the right hemisphere were heard by the left not as thoughts but as foreign voices.

2019-05-04 at 04:38:19: His theory suggests that the phenomena Jaynes describes are occurring for exactly the opposite of the reason Jaynes' posits—not a meeting of previously separate hemispheres, but an alienation between the hemispheres, which produces a self-consciousness towards the voices.

2019-05-04 at 04:38:19: Btw, @KevinSimler, I just re-read one of your Jaynes summary posts (https://t.co/g7Yvq7tCp7; Neurons Gone Wild is an all-time fav) and I found myself thinking that you'd get a ton out of checking out Iain McGilchrist's work.

2019-05-03 at 15:43:02: @tasshinfogleman Yeah the framework from @Meaningness is focused more on the individual results than the intended effect on the world, which so it's obviously limited as a descriptor of any organization intended to impact the world. But seems like a helpful sub-goal anyway!

2019-05-02 at 18:19:33: It's worth noting that we haven't fully clarified our terms, enough to know if this is mostly a difference about what to do with the word "morality" (discard or redefine) or if it's actually more substantive than that. I suspect it's at least a bit of both.

2019-05-02 at 18:19:33: Nate talks about the lack of objective purpose (in absence of God) as implying that there's no way to have prescriptive morality that isn't coercive.

Maybe our difference in perspective about morality is about some difference between descriptive &amp; prescriptive concepts?

2019-05-01 at 23:36:12: @webdevMason @juliagalef Crucial for supporting self-reflection is external reflection: someone (ideally 2+ people) who knows both partners well and regularly talks with each one about the relationship, to triangulate what's going on &amp; make sense of things before inter-partner reconciling.

2019-05-01 at 23:33:18: @webdevMason @juliagalef I think there's another category... something like "inadequate holding capacity for the relationship from its surrounding context", which most relationships have, and it exacerbates the above problems but is also its own thing. And leads to promising relationships imploding. 😢

(already resonance there with your emphasis on serendipity)

2019-05-01 at 20:46:51: @fortelabs @garybasin The thingness of reality is constructed in our minds (specifically, McGilchrist notes, in our left hemispheres) but that doesn't mean reality isn't real! Just that concepts aren't reality—which... isn't news, but experiencing the diff first-hand matters🤯

https://t.co/mAazgrsxBG

2019-05-01 at 20:43:08: @fortelabs @garybasin Hmm, seems the original tweet actually becomes much more clear if you stop talking about specific things and instead just say "there are no things".

Which, not incidentally, is the name of Iain McGilchrist's upcoming book. 

It's a claim not about existence but about thingness.

It does describe "constant competition between cells", although I guess that's friendly competition.

2019-04-30 at 23:52:57: @Meaningness @jamesheathers Given the response to this thread, I have the sense that @jamesheathers could get funding to do this full-time via Patreon or similar quite readily.

2019-04-30 at 18:52:13: @Johnwbh @mattgoldenberg Mmm yeah, those terms were pointing at a very real group.

Nihilism &amp; negative utilitarianism were philosophies invented by people who wanted to point out how terrible they were.

2019-04-30 at 18:51:05: @DellAnnaLuca @KevinSimler Although devil's advocate would simply say "neurons that are less active don't need as much blood flow, and are still getting some" and that seems reasonably likely as well. And probably it doesn't make sense for the brain to kill off neurons just because they aren't being used.

2019-04-30 at 18:49:56: @DellAnnaLuca @KevinSimler Yeah, makes sense in general. Then a question of "how else to model the pressures that cause neurons to reorg?"

&amp; inasmuch as blood flow increases to regions of the brain that are most active (I assume so since fMRI works by measuring this) there does seem to be something there.

2019-04-30 at 18:45:51: @QiaochuYuan @andy_matuschak Mmm, yeah. I built https://t.co/lRiGUxBh9B to tackle this challenge, and I think it does an okay job of that!

2019-04-30 at 18:37:59: @_FitCrit Although also this seems related to brain hemisphere lateralization, and the (rationalist) left hemisphere's job is to focus narrowly and ignore what it doesn't understand, which kind of literally means having a more limited palette. This is key!—but incomplete.

2019-04-26 at 18:09:07: @KevinSimler @ArtirKel (To some extent this ability was bolstered by a bunch of compartmentalization. I've since deconstructed that a fair bit, but other things I've learned in the meantime have left me with probably greater capacity for this sort of thing on net.)

2019-04-26 at 06:45:45: @jonnym1ller @SarahAMcManus People who looked at early brain data described left hemisphere as "dominant", something that has since been refuted—in the sense of the LH being more important.

2019-04-26 at 06:43:02: @jonnym1ller @SarahAMcManus &gt; "LH needs to allow it to do that job"
could sound prescriptive, and it sort of is, but it's also just highlighting that 70% of the corpus callosum is inhibitory, so the RH literally *can't* do it's job if the LH won't let it (&amp; vice versa)

2019-04-26 at 06:42:00: @jonnym1ller @SarahAMcManus In other words, to the left hemisphere, "reality" is near-identical to "my world-model", so there's basically no such thing as "things I don't understand". And that's fine! That's the RH's job. And... LH needs to allow it to do that job.

2019-04-26 at 06:31:48: @jonnym1ller @SarahAMcManus "I don't have a suitable alternative model yet" is a huge chunk of why I think McGilchrist's work is so important. Only the right hemisphere knows how to say that at all.

If LH is in charge, either bogus theories invented ("woo") or evidence denied (eg Matt's response)

2019-04-26 at 06:17:25: @SarahAMcManus @jonnym1ller @RealtimeAI Mmm I find myself wishing I had basically paraphrased what Romeo said, rather than quoting him. The tone was provocative/antagonistic, which has produced a similar implied/present tone in some of the responses, that I'm not enjoying.

2019-04-25 at 19:16:55: @wminshew @micsolana @webdevMason At any rate, I suspect the most effective way to pull this off will be to make a bunch of patently absurd videos, that are obviously fake because they couldn't have come to exist (now-dead actors talking about specific modern events?) but that look convincing. So people feel it.

2019-04-25 at 19:15:32: @wminshew @micsolana @webdevMason Yeah signing will be helpful but the actual thing everybody needs is just to really not trust videos any more than they trust words (as being something that could just be made up).

2019-04-24 at 04:17:59: @mrgunn I basically don't use the phrase "woo" myself, fwiw, because of that confusion. (I was quoting someone else here)

2019-04-24 at 04:16:45: @mrgunn Yeah it's super unfortunate that "woo" encompasses a bunch of real things that are hard to explain &amp; also a bunch of complete quackery. A natural outcome of it being a term invented by people with contempt for both, but yeah. Plus yeah, the comorbidities.

2019-04-23 at 06:02:26: @jonnym1ller @buster @metalearn I mostly knew of the concept of a paradox from logic, where you can use it for things like proof by contradiction. This assumption yields paradox, ∴ false.

But originally &amp; more broadly, it can mean something counter-intuitive or simply counter-to-what-seems-known.

Etymology: https://t.co/szCRWw0huq

2019-04-23 at 05:58:05: @jonnym1ller @buster @metalearn It wasn't until I was reading McGilchrist's book that I fully realized what a paradox *is*. 🤯

To left-hemisphere logic, it means "one or both of these propositions need to be rejected".

To right-hemisphere sense-making, it means "here's something I don't understand yet".

2019-04-23 at 05:33:23: Meanwhile, mystical experiences involve something really important happening in the right hemisphere.

But then when there's then pressure to explain that, people make up all sorts of wild theories with their left hemispheres.

~= what Romeo means here:

https://t.co/Mz8QdMMlK2

2019-04-23 at 05:33:22: This "only explainable things are valid" demand of our modern culture is tightly connected with the present dominance of the left-hemisphere's world, which is symbolic and representational.

2019-04-23 at 05:33:22: But it's not just about scientific language. There's also cultural dominance of the idea that you should be able to explain things in words.

The dao that can be spoken is not the true dao, and there's a whole bunch of stuff that loses its richness when explained: jokes, music,.

2019-04-23 at 05:33:22: Which is not to say "it's scientists' fault that woo people explain bodywork in terms of electromagnetic fields" because eh, fault isn't helpful here. But there's something going on in terms of the memetic selection pressures.

2019-04-23 at 05:33:22: Something I realized recently is that the use of physics language is partly because, well, you've gotta get your words from somewhere, but also partly because of the cultural dominance of science-as-legitimate-way-of-knowing, even among people who don't trust science.

2019-04-23 at 05:33:22: One of the comments on Romeo's facebook post linked to @AndreevAlexei's excellent LW post about this, which notes "Now, it just so happens that the mystical language borrowed a lot of words from physics. But the way they're used is different."

2019-04-23 at 05:12:08: Their sensory modality has no good instrumentation for quantifying it yet. It is essentially much finer detection of CNS activity in the body and all the ways such activation can propagate.

The good news is that, like cultivating a palate, this is trainable.

2019-04-23 at 05:12:08: But *everyone* has shit epistemics, so that isn't a valid dismissal.

2019-04-23 at 05:12:07: Rationalists, I have some bad news for you about woo people. They have a sensory modality you don't and have a variety of languages in order to talk about their experiences with each other. Yes, they generally have bad epistemics and thus weird metaphysics related to all that.

2019-04-23 at 05:12:07: (quoting Romeo Stevens)

Imagine if you had a sense of taste that could only detect 3 different responses: pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. Foodies, sommeliers and the entire world of indulging in the infinite varieties of taste would seem absolutely insane to you.

2019-04-21 at 17:56:06: @RealtimeAI Yep totally. Sometimes songs are musically catchy or some other kind of sticky. Hence the importance of "sometimes" and "might" in talking about this.

2019-04-21 at 17:55:18: @Aaron__FF I like the concept of this but I also think part of the whole point is that there are no purely-denotative descriptors. My sense is what we need is for people to become much more conscious of the difference between denotation &amp; connotation, and able to choose how to orient.

2019-04-21 at 14:06:28: @KarliePonett So yeah, I think that the divergence roughly happens at that approval step, as you say. Thinking about what someone would think while reading can be rich &amp; intimate!

Similar to sharing a song in-person. Can be beautiful, unless you're worried the whole time what they'll think.

2019-04-21 at 14:03:10: @KarliePonett However, these thoughts could all be had in a fearful or shameful way, which would then make them coercive again.

The effect of "meta" is a question of core assumptions, not really the words. Eg "pause to post this?" is totally a thought worth having *if* not full of self-doubt!

2019-04-21 at 13:58:13: @KarliePonett There are coercive &amp; collaborative modes of meta. Examples of meta-thoughts that are more collaborative:
- how do I care for the people in this conversation?
- what is meaningful about what I want to say?
- who are these people &amp; what context do they need for this to make sense?

2019-04-20 at 23:29:17: @JamesClear Is there something it would be good for someone to know, that I haven't gotten around to telling them?

Still seems there are some self-enclosed loops / guru stuff.

2019-04-20 at 06:54:22: @Meaningness @garybasin @_awbery_ This makes me think the distinctions might need to be presented as dialogues. So you could present a similar core engine of Dzogchen (if that's a meaningful notion) and then you &amp; Romeo could ask each other clarifying questions: "Ahh, so does that step involve...?" etc

2019-04-19 at 22:19:33: Oh! one thing I've been realizing is that it seems that almost everything people want to call "awakeness" is associated with right-hemisphere brain function. That is, they all involve an awareness of the limitations of re-presentation and a connection with what is present. 🤔🧠

2019-04-19 at 22:19:32: Or maybe they just all need their own terms, based on what they make possible. And "awakeness" or something else could still be used when talking about things that are true in general of these different states.

Curious about suggestions. 👁👁

2019-04-19 at 22:19:32: And so +1 to dissolving the word "enlightenment", but we do need words to talk about certain temporary or persistent states of being that afford different kinds of perception or cognition. The word "awake" seems to work okay, but maybe it needs to be qualified as "awake to _____"

2019-04-19 at 22:19:32: Really appreciating seeing this perspective from @Meaningness, who has stared at Buddhism 100× as much as me. It's something I'd been coming to appreciate myself recently, grappling with various people referring to various things as "Awakeness"

2019-04-19 at 20:34:25: @SarahAMcManus @HareeshWallis Okay, now the part I'm confused about is "why, if Sutra and Tantra are near-opposites, has Hareesh done such an enormous deep-dive in the form of a book called The Recognition Sutras?

Something something "sutra"~="text"?

https://t.co/EykQ8kZn2y https://t.co/Pq7PvzZQVz

2019-04-19 at 20:29:04: @QiaochuYuan @HareeshWallis I don't think it was this. It had very little about sex, except for a quip that while there was a hot-tub, the retreat center &amp; temple was run by Hindus, not Tantrikas, so we needed to wear swimsuits.

2019-04-19 at 19:51:18: @Meaningness @_awbery_ Aha! My question is answered by @_awbery_'s chart (it was a confusion based on how the 2nd and 3rd columns talk about things differently)

https://t.co/GSucKdbiu7

2019-04-19 at 19:49:01: @_awbery_ @SarahAMcManus @Meaningness Just to make sure I'm understanding: does any given location in one of the first 3 columns correspond to the aim directly to its far right?

Although maybe the aim of spontaneous liberation isn't recognized within the canonical classification vajrayana?

2019-04-19 at 19:46:13: @_awbery_ @SarahAMcManus @Meaningness Aha! Yes, this is basically what I was looking for. One of the things that hadn't fully occurred to me at the start is that part of why the classifications are nebulous is that there isn't one canonical classification accepted by everyone.

2019-04-19 at 19:44:20: @mattgoldenberg This obviously needs to be connected with this chart by @_awbery_ https://t.co/GSucKdbiu7

2019-04-19 at 19:41:44: Okay, hm. And in 2017 I went to a workshop called the Fire &amp; Nectar Retreat, by @HareeshWallis. Which was billed as "tantra + yoga" but now I have no idea where it fits in all of this. The event included teachings &amp; asanas.

https://t.co/tyNARQXEZ7

2019-04-19 at 19:35:27: @Meaningness @QiaochuYuan Mmmm, interaction. Btw @QiaochuYuan I've read that book (~2y ago) and I also think you'd like it.

2019-04-19 at 19:34:10: @Meaningness @_awbery_ Ahh, and in your conception, atiyoga isn't a subset of tantra?

(I apparently need everything spelled out!)

2019-04-19 at 19:26:49: @Meaningness @_awbery_ Huh, but on the chart anuyoga is shown as #8 whereas it seems atiyoga is #9 and is the same as dzogchen. And I thought your approach was based in dzogchen... https://t.co/mThbmFrV0U

2019-04-19 at 14:57:54: @Meaningness @_awbery_ Oh also: David's chart, which puts Sutra as renunciate and Tantra as exultant (https://t.co/O0doNbHDI2) seems (to my very new understanding) to be in contradiction to the chart from Rigpa Wiki (https://t.co/c0Ivoq0Zf1) with the "outer tantras" as ascetic. ascetic ≠ renunciate?

2019-04-19 at 14:50:59: @Meaningness @_awbery_ Oh also: where does the concept of bodhisattva fit into all of this? does it have as much to do with mahayana as the chart from that wiki suggests?

2019-04-19 at 14:48:51: @SarahAMcManus Also Sarah these cashews do look WAY more like beans.

Btw, this idea was inspired by something @jamesnorris_ introduced at our Focus Week retreats, although in that context you would go around &amp; share said treats with other people, as a way of announcing you achieved something.

2019-04-19 at 14:47:12: @SarahAMcManus Note: in order to do this it's important that you have other sources of chocolate, if you like to eat chocolate regularly. Otherwise instead of celebration, you've set yourself up with a system based on rewards (ie temporary absences of punishment) #PCT
https://t.co/Iv2e4hC9cd

2019-04-19 at 14:44:23: @Meaningness @_awbery_ (re previous tweet: to be clear, I mean: multiple big paths and multiple big goals, but each path roughly leads to one specific goal and you don't try to follow multiple paths or you'd get lost or end up somewhere else entirely)

2019-04-19 at 14:37:52: @Meaningness @_awbery_ - is the previous confusion coming from the fact that lots of people do only renunciate, &amp; lots of people do both? (are there people who do no renunciate stuff?)
- I think I had a concept of one big path &amp; one big goal, but it sounds like... are these paths... fractal? https://t.co/HEOgYBupkm

2019-04-19 at 14:35:31: @Meaningness @_awbery_ Principles thing is helpful! Things I'm still confused about:
- do people who successfully follow renunciate paths end up renunciate forever? is this considered correct, or an accident?
- how does that relate to the idea that one might switch back &amp; forth between sutra &amp; trantra?

2019-04-19 at 14:29:17: Now I'm confused again about what "bodhisattva" means, since I didn't have the impression that mahayana and boddhisattva were the same. @tasshinfogleman?

2019-04-19 at 14:29:16: Aha, okay, found this on a wiki. Tagging @SarahAMcManus who was also exploring this yesterday.

(screenshot 2 from wikipedia shows that atiyoga=dzogchen)

https://t.co/c0Ivoq0Zf1 https://t.co/UJKVpRGY8J

2019-04-19 at 14:29:16: Oh and then also what is the relationship of Tantra &amp; Dzogchen...
https://t.co/rYDFxZ50vv

2019-04-19 at 14:10:11: 👆
I found this exchange delightful because the suggestion that the universe is stuck to you is simultaneously helpful+true, and clearly absurdly false. It's a cariacature of a dualistic perspective trying to understand non-dualism.

2019-04-19 at 14:10:10: "If you're regretting, you're basically saying 'we need to throw out the whole universe and get a new one,' which, you know, is rather inconvenient"
"yeah—it's stuck to you!"

Note that it's not intended to be about attachment...

2019-04-19 at 00:42:56: Speaking of which, I'm very interested in @Meaningness' take on the 2×2×2 I made by incorporating the rough structure of attachment styles. Does Tantra have a location on there?

https://t.co/THKInFvaxv

2019-04-19 at 00:41:40: This realization was prompted in part by reflecting on @mattgoldenberg's 2×2 that distinguishes mahayana &amp; hinayana(=theravada?).

https://t.co/pF5Vm6c9H7

2019-04-19 at 00:40:20: Realized today I really don't have a good map of the different schools of Buddhism. Found this excellent chart by @Meaningness differentiating Sutra &amp; Tantra. Now wondering:
• Tantra = Vajrayana ?
• Sutra = {Mahayana, Theravada} ?
• what else is there?

https://t.co/O0doNbHDI2 https://t.co/z1H0rViuSu

2019-04-19 at 00:36:36: @KevinSimler Yeah I totally used some onomastic magic to get a way bigger representation on that map than I would have had otherwise 🙃

2019-04-19 at 00:32:08: You might be able to articulate a hypothetical world-state that all parts of you agree would be better, but then when you try to make that change, you'll face resistance from parts of you that:
- think it's impossible
- think you don't deserve better
- think it's a waste of time

2019-04-19 at 00:32:08: But say you hate someone's mood swings but you love their intellectual banter. 

Now you're conflicted! If you leave, you lose something you want. If you stay... can you get them to change? Do you have to accept something? What will your friends think? Compromise may be unstable.

2019-04-19 at 00:32:07: The word "frustrating" in that tweet is actually pulling a lot of weight!

Etymology: Latin frustratus, past participle of frustrari "to deceive, disappoint, make vain"

If you have a conflict with someone else, that you are unconflicted about, you will simply act (likely exit).

2019-04-18 at 23:57:09: @tasshinfogleman @visakanv Well, they could look just like an ordinary tweet url:
    domain/username/status/128347235934128014
or maybe "status" would get replaced with something else.

...probably it already _would_ be something else, in a different system.

2019-04-13 at 07:34:54: Here's a talk+transcript if you (or anyone who's reading this) is interested in more context on AI alignment work: https://t.co/5C2XrJ24kQ

I deliberately didn't @-mention people here, b/c this thread exists in the context of the interview, which they won't have heard.

2019-04-13 at 07:34:54: There's a growing body of people connected w/ EA who are clear that a different, more spiritual orientation is needed. I find this encouraging!

It's not yet clear to what extent any large chunk of the movement will go in that direction, or if it will fork, or form something new.

2019-04-13 at 07:34:54: Btw, it seems many EAs can't deal with their own suffering either, so they end up counterproductively sacrificing each other's well-being, rather than doing what you describe in the podcast: simultaneously considering people you see (homeless or friends) AND your long-term plan.

2019-04-13 at 07:34:54: Altho I acknowledge this bias, I still think AI risk is very important, which I doubt will shift unless I become certain that collapse will prevent all progress on AI.

But I'm starting personal work on collapse &amp; suffering, so other priorities may become more thinkable for me.

2019-04-13 at 07:34:53: Ofc, I can't speak for everybody, but this definitely resonates with my own experience of trying to think about this stuff, &amp; my experience of others.

And it's not about not thinking about suffering, but about it not being spiritually real to EAs. It's abstract; decoupled: QALYs

2019-04-13 at 07:34:53: As I said, I do think that there's something importantly true about your comment that EAs are inclined towards AI because of not wanting to emotionally deal with suffering. It's easier, it seems, to contemplate "the future exists or not" than feel weight of present collapse.

2019-04-13 at 07:34:53: On a totally different level, many people who are working on AI risk are doing so because it seems like exactly the sort of thing that they *could* do something about, inasmuch as there are core mathematical challenges to solve there, and they are math geeks.

2019-04-13 at 07:34:53: Lots of reasons for this: my own favorite has been that if we were to solve poverty then an unaligned superintelligence were to come into being, it would all be for naught. Meanwhile, an aligned superintelligence could deal with not just poverty but biorisk and nukes as well.

2019-04-13 at 07:34:53: So AI was part of it from the very beginning, not a distraction that showed up later. Then there definitely have been lots of people within EA who started out oriented towards human or animal suffering, and shifted priorities towards AI risk.

2019-04-13 at 07:34:53: Anyway, EA formed from the merger of these people and a few other groups that had come into being around questions like "how can I use my money—whether billions or just &lt;the rest of my paycheck beyond what I need to live&gt;—to best care for the world?"

2019-04-13 at 07:34:53: In the interview, Vinay, you posited that nobody in EA was in a position to do anything about AI risk. I'm not sure what you meant by that, but a bunch of EAs got jobs at DeepMind for this purpose, for instance. And the other work happening seems it should have *someone* doing it

2019-04-13 at 07:34:52: At that time (mid-00s) there was no global conversation around superintelligence as a risk at all, so he wrote the LessWrong sequences to convince people to care about it. That clearly worked to some degree: there are now dozens of people working fulltime on it, and others aware.

2019-04-13 at 07:34:52: At least one of these movements (from Eliezer) was oriented towards AI before altruism. early-Eliezer thought "make AGI, it'll fix everything" then realized that by default it would be like capitalism×100: a system that systematically optimizes for things-other-than-what-matters.

2019-04-13 at 07:34:52: So my aim here is mostly to give you a bit more context about EA's relationship with AI. One thing to know is that it isn't really a single institution. There's a Center for Effective Altruism which coordinates stuff, but EA is more of a "collection of movements under one banner"

2019-04-13 at 07:34:52: I want to note that I resonate with the core point you were making, both in my personal experience and in other EAs (I've been to 5 yearly summits &amp; have many EA friends).

This core point (I gather) being:
       EA prioritization is biased due to inability to BE WITH suffering.

2019-04-13 at 07:34:52: @leashless - Just listened to your interview with @dthorson, and... holy shit. It's going to take me awhile to digest the whole thing. Maybe I'll say more later!

Right now, just a comment on the Effective Altruism thing, since you said you "look forward to being corrected"

2019-04-13 at 06:55:20: In high school I used to procrastinate by reading productivity blogs... then I built a productivity app, which now pays my bills.

2019-04-13 at 06:39:16: @vgr Made me think a lot about the psychology of UBI too. The guy apologized many times. He expressed that he hated asking for money after decades of being able to support himself—and clearly, he preferred asking for money over choosing to die of starvation instead.

2019-04-13 at 06:32:17: @vgr Bought dinner for a fellow at the airport last week who had lost his job after he suffered a stroke last year.

(How do I know that's not just his line? 🤷 He felt honest, not trying-to-convince, and was indeed limping.)

Wondering about the prevalence of that sort of situation.

2019-04-09 at 17:14:43: @mattgoldenberg Also @QiaochuYuan you're gonna wanna check out this thread. And probably @utotranslucence &amp; @alifeofmovement too.

2019-04-09 at 17:12:35: @mattgoldenberg Exactly. I'm very satisfied that I actually made this 2×2×2! And neat to find it on a diagonal rather than just adding a single new axis that's orthogonal to the original 2. I think there's a lot of rich fruit to pick with that sort of two-by-two-ery.

2019-04-09 at 17:10:04: @mattgoldenberg Lots of 2×2s that map onto the attachment styles one. Slightly more central might even be this one around "closeness &amp; independence" (I might call the latter "autonomy" or "self-authorship")

https://t.co/QSMc2fEhlz https://t.co/f6bXLYRB8O

2019-04-09 at 17:06:16: .@SarahAMcManus: what are you doing?
Me: Simultaneously something deeply connected with that-which-is-most-meaningful, and also something fiddly &amp; trivial.

https://t.co/THKInFvaxv

2019-04-09 at 17:02:51: @mattgoldenberg Aha! I figured out how to map it to your 2×2. Twas mostly a technical challenge.

Note that I'm not really talking about attachment styles here, but saying that there exists an isomorphism between {dismissive &amp; preoccupied} and {individualist &amp; collectivist}, &amp; I want {&lt;secure&gt;} https://t.co/7k9esqiyRY

2019-04-09 at 15:46:20: @mattgoldenberg Another way to point at it is to consider 2×2s that map onto this one about attachment styles. Because of tensions on diagonal dismissive &amp; preoccupied axis ⤡, it's easy to feel like that's the natural axis &amp; that Secure isn't possible. Not sure how to map that into your 2×2 https://t.co/lLZ7smpOzN

2019-04-09 at 15:44:03: @mattgoldenberg One toy model to point at this might be to gesture at the difference between a Kegan 3 Hivemind and a Kegan 5 Hivemind. The latter incorporates a bunch of really important things about individualism that the former does not. (And the latter is more like the thing I'm aiming at)

2019-04-09 at 15:40:54: @mattgoldenberg Mmm I find this 2×2 fascinating and beautiful. Which is all-the-more exciting because I can't fully locate my own sense of orientation on it!

I think it would project down to somewhere in the bottom right↘️, but also it has important aspects of ↙️&amp; ↗️. Oh &amp; Boddhisattva.

2019-04-09 at 15:01:58: @noididntreadit I think that in general I do have patterns like the one you described though. I've tended to value ~originality a lot. Some people do a lot of summarizing others' ideas while writing... I have drives to do as little of that as possible. Probably to a pathological degree 🙃

2019-04-09 at 14:59:41: @noididntreadit Ah! No, it's actually not the case that I wanted to own the thing in the first place—I don't have a car to put a bumper sticker on.

But I _did_ have a preference for it existing, which has been satisfied by this result. And apparently I wanted to tell people about it.

2019-04-09 at 01:00:24: @dthorson @leashless Haven't listened to this one yet but just saw this ribbonfarm article that dovetails with something from the first one, that was something like "collapse is already here, it just isn't evenly distributed"

https://t.co/57ZeUCRRC6

2019-04-09 at 00:52:58: @z3nblack Definitely a lot of uncertainty early on and a lot of gradual deepening of commitment.

2019-04-09 at 00:52:25: Underestimating how long something will take happens 99% of the time.
I think people also chronically under-estimate how much more awesome their life can be when they do things worth doing.

How to know in advance? I either unconsciously know or have somehow made 4 great guesses.

2019-04-09 at 00:52:25: 👆
This is something I've been fortunate to encounter multiple times. I have the sense that it's actually quite common... assuming that you're someone who's willing to put in hard work to achieve something.

2019-04-09 at 00:52:25: If I'd known in advance how hard it would be and how long it would take, I never would have done it—unless I'd *also* known how worth it it would be.

2019-04-07 at 21:33:02: @noididntreadit Mmm this last quote reminds me of @QiaochuYuan's first tweet, last week:

https://t.co/bgW8jmkaes

2019-04-07 at 21:32:18: These things are always true to some extent, so it's a question of whether you want to emphasize them or de-emphasize them.

2019-04-07 at 21:32:18: In order to get on the same page, you need to get on the same *side*. Taking a same-sided stance here means orienting based on assumptions like:
• there is something I don't understand here
• both of us care about figuring that out

2019-04-07 at 21:32:17: More important than the exact phrasing is the tone, and upstream of tone is STANCE.

https://t.co/NeMJbY5f8U

2019-04-07 at 21:32:17: Instead, say "I really want to understand what you're saying, and I'm currently not getting anything new from this. I believe I've heard you say this before. Do you have the sense I missed you last time, or is there a new piece that you're wanting to add to that?"

2019-04-07 at 21:32:17: But if you're still like "I have no idea why you're telling me this thing I already know" then that could be a great time to share that. Phrasing matters though—I wouldn't advise uttering the quotation earlier in this tweet.

2019-04-07 at 21:32:17: If you have a model for why they're saying it even though you already know it, then MAYBE you can stop there (although don't trust your models too much—your brain makes up stuff.)

https://t.co/nbWnSdXz8O

2019-04-07 at 21:32:17: And also ask: how would they know if I knew it? maybe I partially know it but if I knew it deeper they'd know because I'd act differently...

...maybe they're *assuming* I'd act differently because they're making some other assumptions about me or the world.

2019-04-07 at 21:32:16: Now, the reason might not have anything to do with you at all. Maybe they just want to vent. Maybe they tell this story every time chickens are mentioned.

But if you can tell that they really are trying to tell yourself something they don't already know, then ask: what is that?

2019-04-07 at 21:32:16: When this is just a random tweet (which is what @QiaochuYuan was originally talking about) then it's just 🤷

But if you have this experience with someone who knows you well, you need to at least acknowledge this:
        they wouldn't be saying this if they didn't have a reason. https://t.co/tD5eT6djwQ

2019-04-03 at 16:24:04: @jonnym1ller @ribbonfarm This section is making me think of something I've done recently. When people want to hear more about the culture-change project I'm in, I first ask them "what questions are you holding that you think we might have or *be* an answer to?" https://t.co/UHzVyW9m7s

2019-04-03 at 16:16:53: @jonnym1ller @ribbonfarm Ahaha and then the Question your Qs section is consciously deploying left-hemisphere thinking. But be careful b/c the LHem will tend to err thusly:

&gt; Of course, make sure that when you do answer Q’, don’t mistake your answer for a full answer to the original question Q, however.

2019-04-03 at 16:13:23: @jonnym1ller @ribbonfarm And this then makes me question my choice of the metaphor of "hold your questions". Because holding onto things is very much a left-hemisphere thing (grasping tools) whereas I think a lot of the thrust of the post is trying to point at right-hemisphere thinking.

2019-04-03 at 16:12:14: @jonnym1ller @ribbonfarm Mmm, the first thing that comes to mind as I read your highlighted version is around this not-knowing piece. Definitely feels related to Iain McGilchrist's model of the brain hemispheres and how the left can't handle not-knowing while the right naturally does.

2019-04-03 at 16:10:31: RT @jonnym1ller: @Malcolm_Ocean I just discovered the superb @ribbonfarm post of yours on the art of asking &amp; holding questions. Curious if…

2019-04-03 at 16:09:29: @jonnym1ller Yeah liget is legit.

I read that article last year, thought lots about it, &amp; explored it a bit myself. And @QiaochuYuan and I were recently talking about that in relation to the hemispheres.

I don't know the details, but defs something more L🧠R-integrated with liget, vs anger.

2019-04-03 at 16:03:55: @mattgoldenberg Mmm yes I like this and it resonates for me. ♥

And I guess that is also different than the thing that occurs when something resentable happens but one doesn't resent in the first place.

Kinda like Kintsugi - repairing broken bowls with gold. https://t.co/7NfX2tazvw

2019-04-03 at 03:55:22: There are contexts in which that can be worth doing. The obvious one is because they've apologized and you want to recognize their apology. But I think that often the impetus to say "I forgive you" actually comes from an urge to assert power over someone.

2019-04-03 at 03:55:22: Clarification 👀

There is a huge difference between the mental act of forgiveness and the *speech act* of forgiveness. I'm not talking about the latter at all. The question of "when does it make sense to tell someone you forgive them for something?" is a whole different thing.

2019-04-03 at 03:46:46: It isn't easy—consistently taking a post-resentment stance basically requires an entire mental OS upgrade.

But it's worth it—that upgrade allows clearer thinking, including making sense of about ppl's expected future behavior, &amp; making choices about how you engage with the world

2019-04-03 at 03:46:45: This, you can also do without resenting. It will actually be much much more effective for _you enjoying your life,_ in fact, if you can do it without resenting the person.

2019-04-03 at 03:46:45: I do, however, believe that sometimes someone might act in such a way that you don't want to spend more time with them, not from a stance of punishment but for the same reason you don't do other activities you don't enjoy (eg you usually don't put on music you don't enjoy).

2019-04-03 at 03:46:45: *I mostly don't think punishment makes sense, but that's a tangent here. See this thread for clues on that (click the tweet below then scroll up)

2019-04-03 at 03:46:45: Note that even if you think that punishment makes sense, say for game-theoretical reasons*, resentment and punishment are totally separate things. 

You can punish someone without resenting them, or resent them and not actually effectively enacting any punishment on them.

2019-04-03 at 03:46:45: And, like many people who recommend forgiveness, I hold that resent is not beneficial for anything. There's a well known quote, “Resentment is like taking poison and waiting for the other person to die.” https://t.co/b49RGXLDjA

2019-04-03 at 03:46:44: Resentment isn't a belief, or an emotion. More of an attitude, or stance, or orientation.

And it's related to grudges, spite, bitterness, &amp; grievance. (And blame, and entitlement, and being offended.)

None of these words *is* the thing (map≠territory) but there's a thing here.

2019-04-03 at 03:46:44: Forgiveness is sort of a backwards concept, like phlogiston (which ~= "the absence of oxygen").

Forgiveness ~= "the absence of resentment".

So if you don't resent in the first place, then you can reach a state of "forgiveness" without actually performing an act of "forgiving".

2019-04-03 at 03:05:39: @utotranslucence You can make a new storm that embeds previous tweets in any order, but you can't later change which tweet is a reply to which other tweet. (Visa laments this here👇)

2019-04-02 at 18:48:57: (And! Lots of complexity in details of the actual *relationships* between the hemispheres... and I don't really understand this at all! I'm just reaching that chapter in the book, and I'm guessing even after I've read it I'll still feel like we really don't know yet!)

2019-04-02 at 18:48:56: Oh and another thought: Kübler-Ross' 5 Stages of Grief seem to also involve a left→right hemisphere shift!

Denial - very very left-hemisphere.
Anger - also left-hemisphere
Bargaining - ??
Depression - right awakens, left collapsed
Acceptance - right, w/ left integrated https://t.co/Cl5fKaTqsp

2019-04-02 at 18:40:44: I'm valuing, in this moment, that even as I feel a deepened sense of understanding here, I also feel aware of how much I still don't know. (This too is a hemispheres thing.)

https://t.co/MriWMW7w6h

2019-04-02 at 18:40:43: But, as McGilchrist points out, most people in the modern western world don't have well-integrated brains! 🧠

Our left hemispheres have taken over in a certain ways, and the result is the identification with this need for control &amp; certainty &amp; being right: hence, anger.

2019-04-02 at 18:40:43: So from the left hemisphere's perspective, it can maintain its sense of control by feeling anger rather than grief. And having this control matters to it a lot.

A well-integrated brain isn't subject to this need for control, but can hold it as part of a larger picture.

2019-04-02 at 18:40:43: I still don't understand the full structure, but one thing I've learned in the meantime from reading McGilchrist's book on the @divided_brain is that:
A) most emotions (grief for sure) are mostly based in RightHem
B) anger is based in LHem
C) grasping for need to control is LHem

2019-04-01 at 14:55:57: @DellAnnaLuca Oh! I'm not saying it's GOOD at this role.🤣

I'm just saying it's kind of the only thing allowed to play it! Kids aren't allowed very much independence while still living at home / in high school, and so post-secondary education necessarily becomes the transition phase.

2019-04-01 at 14:48:42: @DellAnnaLuca Although university also plays a key role in our current society of allowing people to try independence in a miniature real-world, to learn adulting.

https://t.co/Zm99pkDGTg

2019-04-01 at 14:45:02: @DellAnnaLuca As you yourself said, university admissions is mostly screening for smarts &amp; conscientiousness, not actually training. If it were, people would audit for free. See also "The Desire To Pass Tests"

Experimentation, no paywalls, absurd loans &amp; opportunity cost—totally!

This assumption that education is just job-training... it's *become* that, but isn't intrinsically.

2019-04-01 at 14:40:28: @DellAnnaLuca Umm... it seems that you're proposing a shift from

&gt; "Higher education has been built around the needs of the universities, not of the students."

to having it be built around the needs of employers. Not saying this is bad, but it *is* a different set of priorities.

2019-03-30 at 15:31:01: @visakanv @TaylorPearsonMe @james_clear @devonzuegel @farnamstreet Hm this thread about incentive design is making me think of this post by @meditationstuff, particularly as summarized by @tasshinfogleman here:

https://t.co/GVuDsBphUZ

2019-03-30 at 00:25:02: Note the presence of this suspicious word "just" in the LHem-based thinking there.

https://t.co/VS3tG2qLDU

2019-03-30 at 00:25:01: Which relates to these other quotes from Inner Game of Work.

The LHem likes to pretend it has no learning to do: it needs to JUST EXECUTE its perfect PLAN. From RHem perspective, all is learning. More accurate except in very constrained circumstances.

https://t.co/wfBIzpbuCB

2019-03-30 at 00:25:01: Note that the left hemisphere also mostly ignores what the right hemisphere "knows", because the RHem makes sense of knowledge in a totally different way. 

So if you're identified with the LHem (as almost all people alive today are) then you'll encounter what Visa describes ⬆️

2019-03-30 at 00:25:01: Just came across this  tweet that is loudly reminding me of my recent reading into Iain McGilchrist's @divided_brain work.

The left hemisphere basically pretends anything it doesn't understand doesn't exist, so it needs the RHem to periodically point out unknowns &amp; not-knowing. https://t.co/pOUHPgKfWI

2019-03-25 at 16:56:25: @thewiseturtle @cosimia_ I would reframe this as "modern life-threatening scenarios are made *MORE* threatening by acute anxiety rather than less". So it's less about amount of risk but about the response being maladaptive for the situation.

2019-03-25 at 14:28:36: If you've ever had the experience of "putting something off" and then the moment it actually happens is clearly the *right* moment? Like something just clicks? That's kairos in action. But we're afraid to trust what we can't systematically control. Well, our left hemispheres are.

2019-03-25 at 14:28:36: What this article points out is that we don't even really consider that there might be other ways to view time. The other Ancient Greek word was "kairos", and it points at a more subjective time, based on the feeling of a given moment or arc of experience.

2019-03-25 at 14:28:36: This paper resonates with my recent thinking about McGilchrist's @divided_brain model too—the impact of attentional mode on experience. Linear, gridlike, interchangeable time (what the Ancient Greeks called "chronos") is definitely a more left-hemisphere way of viewing time. 🧠 https://t.co/DFDRTg4IK0

2019-03-24 at 18:53:23: @RealtimeAI @dela3499 @reasonisfun I've been thinking a lot lately about the tendency to bullshit oneself, because of learning about the left hemisphere's tendencies towards rationalization &amp; confabulation and noticing it a ton in myself.

2019-03-23 at 05:10:37: And so that's a thing I'd add to my #TwitterReplacement: the ability to organize tweets more directly after the fact. To say "check out this thread but particularly this chain of it", for instance.

(Also it would collect all notifications from a given thread and organize them)

2019-03-23 at 05:10:37: This isn't *bad*! Status &amp; power aren't bad. Twitter's design is a simple prioritization system that works great for most use-cases.

*And* you want to be aware of the impacts and be able to shift them when necessary.

2019-03-23 at 05:10:36: I've noticed myself take this role sometimes. My "mmm" &amp; "ahh" &amp; "oh?" that make a 2-person convo very engaged can make a group convo just about me and the speaker. I'm kinda steering their train, making it about my understanding &amp; interest rather than about what's on their mind.

2019-03-23 at 05:10:36: It occurs to me that this is an interesting metaphor for what sometimes happens when someone in a conversation is given (or claims) a certain kind of high-status role. Even if someone else is talking, the attention always returns to what this person thinks or wants to know.

2019-03-23 at 05:10:36: But in this case, because @cosimia_ was engaging a bunch with my tweets and *she* was the owner of this particular thread, there's no way at all to follow the train of thought that *I* was originally having.

2019-03-23 at 05:10:36: The reason is that Twitter's thread view prioritizes replies from the person who tweeted the very first tweet in a thread. This makes sense! It's why, even if many people reply to the first tweet in a tweetstorm—even before storm finished—the storm shows up as one block.

2019-03-23 at 05:10:36: I was on a roll—lots to say. Ask a question I've thought about a lot but not talked about and that's what you'll get!

But it's really hard to follow my train of thought in this thread. Even for me, trying to track down my tweets in it is hard.

2019-03-23 at 05:10:36: As I continue musing on how I'd design a #TwitterReplacement, I noticed that something really messy happened with a thread of mine from a month ago.

2019-03-22 at 15:29:07: @Plinz @DoqxaScott @SlaytonBenjamin @RJsnda Seems there's also a kind of "taking self as object" move. @Meaningness frames this as "selfing". It's not that there is no self in such a moment, but that there isn't a fixation on it.

2019-03-21 at 22:47:21: Off the top of my head, a list of artists that do a fair bit of this:
• @BT (first song on the playlist is by him and has a world record for # of vocal edits)
• @seebmusic
• @si_bonobo
• @KygoMusic

2019-03-21 at 22:47:21: I have a playlist of songs I like that have glitchy vocal edits! Decided to make it public so that other people could check it out. I'd love to hear more recommendations of songs that could go well on here.

(A) still active on twitter and
(B) actually interested in what I currently post. 🤔

Not interesting to others?

2019-03-20 at 07:21:13: @reasonisfun One can experience a state of "not-knowing". It's a thing. It's a different thing that experiencing "eating some pizza" which is also not knowing. Negation and absence aren't the same. The opposite of black is still a color, not the absence of the concept of colorness altogether.

2019-03-20 at 07:10:49: @lawsonfulton @visakanv 1Q84 is a really weird book

oddly, despite the variety of wild stuff in there, the scene that stands out to me most is that it features a scene where the protagonist goes to pee and is thinking about something (a lover?) while he does.

...so many stories have no bathrooms.

2019-03-20 at 07:04:33: @fieryfalliblist If I temporarily buy into the idea that it's meaningful to summarize something so rich with a word or two, I would say "Integrity". I think it's upstream of your 1,2,3,5.

https://t.co/Zm99pkVihQ

2019-03-19 at 20:01:33: There've been over 1,400,000 striking students worldwide in the last few weeks. I think that this represents something really important both for climate &amp; for coming-of-age.

On Wikipedia, "The strikes have also been criticised as truancy." Not surprising.

2019-03-19 at 06:39:42: @danielharan Hmmm... the image I got from reading @AdamKahane was of a smaller group of people in a room together. But you'd need many such rooms to handle current USA politics.

I think the thing you're saying would help a bit, but I don't think it it would *feel* like agreement.

2019-03-19 at 06:25:02: What does it make sense to do in a world with a shattered Overton Window?

I wish I knew the answer. Alas, all I can hope for in this moment is that I've framed a slightly better question.

and now I'm thinking of @NoraBateson's recent tweet: https://t.co/VrAIcNYjDM

2019-03-19 at 06:25:02: My sense is that the *agreement* part really is important there. It's not enough that everyone thinks it—they need to actually be able to recognize that at least on that meta-level, there's some common ground. That means a shared purpose, which allows collaboration.

2019-03-19 at 06:25:01: That's somewhat alarming because as @AdamKahane explains from decades of working with major conflicts, one key step for creatively moving forward is getting people-in-conflict to experience agreement that the situation needs to change.

https://t.co/m6KaIfDlqe

2019-03-19 at 06:25:01: And even then, probably many people would disagree with such statements if uttered by a political opponent, because it might be a trap to try to convince you of something you know you don't believe.

(This *does* happen, but any conversation in which people fear this is FUBAR.)

2019-03-19 at 06:25:01: I am literally polling my mind for things I think all Americans would agree with and mostly I'm just getting facts, not opinions. &amp; even then, not all facts. 😶

Maybe meta-opinions like "political tensions in America sure are high these days" or "this next election is important"

2019-03-19 at 06:25:01: (Each group has its own Overton Window, I guess, although these are also nebulous and multitudinous. A moderate has a different but overlapping Overton Window with a more extremely-opinionated person in the same general area.)

2019-03-19 at 06:25:01: I would bet that over the last while, the main political party positions roughly formed each end of the Overton Window. Any opinion between left &amp; right was acceptable.

Now each group holds the other in such contempt that there are very few opinions that are broadly acceptable.

2019-03-19 at 06:25:01: Now that I'm thinking about this, I would characterize it as something much messier than just collapse. The Overton Window is obviously many-dimensional. It probably used to have some range in all dimensions. The point is, there was just ONE Overton Window.

2019-03-19 at 06:25:00: Another astounding thought from @david_perell's recent article: that the Overton Window, ie "the range of acceptable opinions in society", has collapsed.

Curious to know how many people *are* listening to Emerge! It's a fascinating medium where no like/comment section means I have no idea!

2019-03-18 at 21:29:34: ...I haven't gotten to end of McGilchrist's book yet, so I don't know!

Based on my internal practice &amp; introspection since learning of @divided_brain model, it *seems* that the LHemisphere needs to take the RHem as authority. RHem is then open to new info, so whole brain learns.

2019-03-18 at 21:29:33: But as the 🤯 book The Guru Papers points out, our culture has been authoritarian for a long time, and we've ALL got substantial tendencies to try to seek safety in authorities.

And based on recent @divided_brain neuroscience, seems this is partially innate. So... what do? https://t.co/aM8zvYJcBi

2019-03-18 at 21:29:33: Altemeyer notes correlations between this "authoritarian follower" pattern and current right-wing politics. Not sure if that would hold pre-60s-counterculture-rotation (see @Meaningness) but I'm guessing broadly so inasmuch as "right-wing" = "status quo".
https://t.co/FhzdtKRCAM

2019-03-18 at 21:29:33: Bob Altemeyer has a book called The Authoritarians in which he describes patterns of thinking that sound very similar to all of this:

(This screenshot is from this fascinating series on people who post on estranged parent forums. https://t.co/FxER188SsQ) https://t.co/nPMvMdOODh

2019-03-18 at 21:29:32: As articulated (probably inadvertently) in @Bartoven's song "Life", the left-hemisphere is caught up in what's right by its own theory, and assesses everything by that.

https://t.co/ydiOlYoitZ

2019-03-18 at 21:29:32: Afaict, from my current reading of Iain McGilchrist's book The Master and his Emissary, the left hemisphere's job is maintaining a workable coherent system (and ignoring what doesn't fit). Blindspots necessary for focus.

Most modern western people identify with their LH, so...

2019-03-18 at 21:29:32: &gt; When information sources were limited, we traded truth for coherence. 
&gt; Trigger warning: the media was never truthful. There, I said it. To be fair, the media didn’t actively deceive the public either.

2019-03-18 at 21:19:09: @fortelabs There's probably a tweak that would increase the extent to which this evokes "acceleration" Some sort of motion line/effect, or maybe making the line dashed and having the dashes get longer.

2019-03-18 at 21:16:55: @fortelabs 2, maybe 3. Though I think you can do way better. Here's a 3min mockup of how I'd evoke the concept "write of passage" https://t.co/tWY8TuW0uf

2019-03-18 at 20:42:53: I seriously think this song can be a helpful mantra in a moment of the left-hemisphere feeling threatened by something that contradicts its theory. Note that "theory" here doesn't mean something explicit, just whatever simplified world-model the LHem is taking as absolute truth.

2019-03-18 at 20:42:53: 🎶I’d rather find a balance, and reach for things beyond my wildest dreams
🎵&amp; watch them dreams come true

RHem reaches into the unknown.

1st verse is less relevant; if anything it's from LHem perspective. Def feeling an internal conflict.

Lyrics: https://t.co/B3bp7PUSKJ

2019-03-18 at 20:42:52: That was chorus. Second verse:

🎵I see the patterns, yes I do see how your way is so secure
🎶I’ll leave that all to you

LHem operates by automatic patterns, and feels secure in its sense of coherent world-model. RHem *needs* LHem to do autopilot so it can stay big picture.

2019-03-18 at 20:42:52: Loving this song "Life" by @Bartoven+@SigmaHQ. Doubt he was thinking about 🧠hemispheres, but he was seeing the same structure.

RHem sings to LHem:
🎶 Lighten up, you’re way too serious
🎵 You’re way too caught up in what’s right
🎶 &amp; what your theory is

2019-03-18 at 14:33:22: "Before there can be harmony, there must be difference."

(@divided_brain)

2019-03-17 at 18:03:30: 🤔 I think you'd ideally want it to not just be a house full of 18yos, but a mixed age range that's still narrow enough that nobody needs to be the "parent"... but wide enough that people don't have to figure out adulting from scratch.

Although ofc there is the internet for that

2019-03-17 at 18:03:30: Because if you remove the costs of new buildings, JSTOR, profs... and the "signalling" aspect as even a weak justification for the price in terms of RoI...

then giving 18yos a context they could move into together and discover independence together becomes way more affordable

2019-03-17 at 18:03:30: I'm taking in that there's a sense in which high school + [being a teen at home] aren't actually really offering a developmental context for growing into independence for many people (anymore).

And university does. I'm looking forward to seeing what replaces that role.

2019-03-17 at 18:03:29: Reading this article by @david_perell, I'm grokking something I hadn't before about the relationship of college-as-coming-of-age-ritual to shifts in parenting to "a society ruled by parents who won’t let their children out of sight"

https://t.co/FcIy2LseEB https://t.co/X087jblGyw

2019-03-17 at 15:50:56: @fortelabs Here's a link to the Kindle edition since it seems elsewhere in this thread that that's what you prefer. This new expanded edition has a great intro that clarifies a lot of his thinking in the decade since he published it.

https://t.co/1bkFkxZjQE

2019-03-17 at 15:46:29: @fortelabs Here's a short tweetstorm by me about my thinking on it. But it's developed a lot since then based on reading just the first 20% of this book and I expect it to develop a lot more. I'm planning to make training programs for this stuff.

https://t.co/HoGITPAEIP

2019-03-17 at 15:44:39: @fortelabs Early brain hemisphere models were totally confused, and so for decades this have been unfashionable to look at, but the hemispheres play very different roles in tiny birds, and human brains are *more* lateralized than birds, so clearly there must be something important going on.

2019-03-17 at 15:42:48: @fortelabs Currently reading Iain McGilchrist's book The Master &amp; his Emissary, and it's having profound effects on my ability to introspect. And I wasn't sure about calling this paradigmatic but then I thought about it and it definitely is. Grokking brain structure key for grokking thought

2019-03-17 at 15:40:30: @KeenDisregard @fortelabs I just read Beginning of Infinity by Deutsch and it was a serious candidate to answer Tiago's original question here. Haven't read FoR so can't compare, but BoI is newer.

2019-03-17 at 15:35:21: @JeffreyALoyd @visakanv @paulg Yeah, silence probably a good place to start. It's not just a language shift but a thinking shift. You need to, in yourself, access a way of thinking that takes in the investor and their question, rather than just querying "what's my line?" and saying something.

2019-03-17 at 15:33:05: @KevinSimler @vgr Seems like an even further extreme than "delete the boring rambly introduction that was just there to get your thoughts flowing".

I'm also thinking about how lots of people recommend flipping through a book until something catches your interest, rather than starting at word one.

2019-03-16 at 16:21:12: @Meaningness @reasonisfun Rationality involves both hemispheres, to be clear!

But based on what I've read, rationalization (including the extreme of confabulation) seems to be predominantly a LH phenomenon.

"Confabulation is believed to be a result of damage to the right frontal lobe of the brain." (wp)

2019-03-16 at 16:18:10: @RealtimeAI Intelligence is key, and so is leverage. We need both.

Both wells of resources are huge and untapped. The more pressing question is "what leverage do we have to release what &amp; how much?"

I think there's potential for powerful synergies here, beyond just "rich help poor"

2019-03-16 at 16:15:41: @visakanv fabrication? that's the closest one I have so far but I'm pretty—aha! Of course it's in the index of Iain McGilchrist's book. Pretty sure "confabulation" is the word I was looking for ✔

2019-03-16 at 16:08:42: Twitter what's that word for when a person does something for one reason and then makes up a totally different reason why they did it? eg a split brain patient, one hemisphere does a thing, other hemisphere gives (false) explanation for it.

2019-03-16 at 15:52:34: @Meaningness @reasonisfun Also David have you looked into any of Iain McGilchrist's stuff on brain hemisphere lateralization? It's profoundly relevant to your work. He frames the modernity madness &amp; breakdown as being characteristic of the left hemisphere denying the role of the right. Core to all of this

2019-03-16 at 15:48:33: @quasimondo Aha, yes, that makes sense. Is this sort of like deepstyle? The GPT-2 model keeps everything it learned about language from the larger corpus, but then adapts its output style to be like the famous quotes?

2019-03-16 at 15:42:19: @reasonisfun @Meaningness I'm actually not sure if #MetaRationalism is a single philosophy at all, or if it's just pointing at "philosophies meta to rationalism" 🤔

(the implication being that there may be multiple ways to do that)
(but of course all philosophies have variations, over time &amp; between ppl)

2019-03-16 at 15:39:21: The above uncertainty relates to this tweet of mine from last week, which I'd love more responses to:

https://t.co/xpUEDAMQQg

2019-03-16 at 15:30:27: @reasonisfun @Meaningness That's partially splitting hairs about the word "disagree", but it's important. My eyes constantly disagree about what I'm seeing, but that just gets integrated into a 3D view, not fought over.

Physics &amp; biology emphasize different things but are both models of matter.

2019-03-16 at 15:26:23: @reasonisfun @context_ing My current recommended introduction to this stuff is this podcast btw: https://t.co/LSjHNdaYct

He lays it out really clearly in 44 minutes.

(The original link to the convo with Jordan Peterson is also great, but this is a clearer intro for most people I think.)

2019-03-16 at 15:22:07: @reasonisfun @context_ing I think that it's not being model-free, not "using a better model", but *using models differently*. Which is similar but I think importantly distinct than "using inexplicit models". The right hemisphere has a different relationship to its models, and this matters.

2019-03-16 at 15:20:26: @reasonisfun @Meaningness I don't see a disagreement here! My explicit knowledge of both philosophies is a bit past "I've read Beginning of Infinity and Meaningness". Possible I'm misunderstanding either here.

Also possible I'm using them both fluidly in such a way that they don't FEEL they disagree 😉🙃

2019-03-15 at 05:40:30: @everytstudies @cognazor This is part of what I like about twitter though. It lets my thoughts at a given moment just be my thoughts at that given moment, rather than becoming reified into a PIECE.

I also like that I have pieces. But I'd like a good space for putting out my drafts as what they are. 🤔

2019-03-09 at 16:04:53: @visakanv If you're on mobile, you might need to use the "share link to tweet" feature. If you're on desktop, find the tweet then click on its date. The one whose url is active in a given popped-up-thread is the one with the biggest text.

2019-03-09 at 15:58:28: @visakanv I've vaguely thought maybe a browser extension could do it? Search twitter for each tweet on the screen, then stick a thing next to the 🗨🔃♥ icons with a # of quotes.

API search only gets recent stuff. I think web search gets all...? test one of your most-quoted? (search url)

2019-03-09 at 15:52:27: @HarmonicTension We're encultured to think we can't do things we aren't formally trained to do.

2019-03-09 at 15:39:51: @visakanv And I guess relatedly to the 10,000 thing... in school if it works you're done. I mean you have to be able to do it again but only when you're tested again. With a real-world situation, you can continue getting value out of something that works, but you get to naturally get bored

2019-03-09 at 05:11:54: @eriktorenberg This difference is dramatically underappreciated by people who think of the world as if it behaves the same as some decent abstractions, plus or minus some error bars. (This is most people)

Relates to difference between "complex" &amp; "complicated" systems:

👇

2019-03-01 at 02:49:45: It seems to me, based on McGilchrist's work and a ton of my own experience, that shifting one's locus from L to R will produce a major shift in how that conflict shows up, because of the nature of the asymmetry. R can make sense of L perspective WAY better than vice versa.

2019-03-01 at 02:49:44: Most of the corpus callosum (L &amp; R hemisphere connection) is inhibitory connections. I keep going on about internal conflict &amp; I suspect that L↔R interaction represents a lot of that conflict.

https://t.co/9DgeXxEqAE

2019-03-01 at 02:49:44: But I'm not holding these as separate skills to train—my right hemisphere is actually quite good at all of these already! That's its job—and I've trained many of these too.

The thing is that these capacities have been restricted by my left hemisphere's dominance.

⚛nonlinear thinking
🌏big picture thinking
❓embracing uncertainty
😍orienting to what's meaningful

🕸seeing world as flowing complex systems (not static concepts)

2019-03-01 at 02:49:43: IM has a different model than the classic rational-left / emotional-right brain divide, where each hemisphere specializes not in different things but in different perspectives.

2019-03-01 at 02:49:43: After watching this engaging convo between JP &amp; IM about the latter's work on the @divided_brain, I have the sense that my top personal learning priority is shifting my internal locus to my right hemisphere.

Twitter would be so amazing if not built on an ads model. I have a pipedream to build such a thing

2019-02-28 at 00:02:08: @cosimia_ @Conaw In a large space, the ☠might be helpful to eliminate dead ends, but you still need a ❤ to hone in on an exact spot with any accuracy.

(Also my choice of symbols was a little weird. Didn't think this thru. Gotta go, actually! Enjoyed this tweet-exchange!)

2019-02-28 at 00:00:54: @cosimia_ @Conaw For three dimensions, consider a helicopter or bird or some situation where there's a height dimension as well. Now the  ☠-based orientation is even harder, but with the ❤ you still just need one beacon for them to hone in on it.

2019-02-27 at 23:59:25: @cosimia_ @Conaw In an open field, you can maybe trap them in the middle of a bunch of ☠☠☠☠s, but that'll be hard because if you try to make a circle of ☠ they'll avoid it.

Or, you can just put the ❤ in the exact spot.

2019-02-27 at 23:58:27: @cosimia_ @Conaw Imagine trying to steer someone to stop in one exact spot. You can place a ❤ beacon they'll move towards, or a ☠beacon they'll move away from. (Reverse for goths)

In a hallway, you can trap them in the middle of two ☠☠, or just put the ❤in the exact spot.

2019-02-27 at 23:54:09: @cosimia_ (This multi-person tweetstorm is a total mess, but I want this tweet ☝ to also link to this one 👇)

https://t.co/3wOPYcczVm

2019-02-27 at 23:50:46: @cosimia_ (In case it's not clear, my use of desire &amp; fear = shorthand for any sort of "towardsness" &amp; "awayness" experiences, whether thoughts or feelings.) 

Emotion-wise:

towardsness includes desire, lust, curiosity, beauty, play, 😋
awayness includes fear, disgust, contempt, anger, 😨

2019-02-27 at 23:41:11: @cosimia_ @Conaw Btw: "positive" &amp; "negative" are confusing words. Common mapping is:
➕positive ~= desire
➖negative ~= fear (&amp; disgust, etc)

but in control systems...
➕"positive" feedback ~= fear. "I need to increase this gap"
➖"negative" feedback ~= desire. "I need to close this gap"

2019-02-27 at 23:35:22: @cosimia_ @Conaw While I'm at it: not all FEEDBACK 🔃 is reward/punishment either.

You can choose to interpret everything you experience as reward &amp; punishment, or nothing. Both are coherent.

(The latter ≠ being oblivious to fact "this person is trying to punish me"; means not internalizing)

2019-02-27 at 23:32:04: @cosimia_ @Conaw ⚠Important⚠

Not all consequences are rewards/punishments. If you're trying to catch the bus and you make it (or miss it) that's not a reward (or punishment).

(This confusion is common, which is making me think just now that it must be part of the pattern, not a coincidence.)

2019-02-27 at 23:30:12: @visakanv Btw, if/when you do this with me, make sure to do Tweets With Replies, as most of my highest quality content seems to come out in replies to other people.
https://t.co/9P9tAgDT8w

2019-02-27 at 23:23:56: @cosimia_ @Conaw "reward is just the temporary relief of punishment" might surprise; it connects with my remark at the top that most humans are in chronic fear. Reward represents temporary relief of that fear: don't worry, you're okay, you did the right thing—this time. Implicit threat.

2019-02-27 at 23:22:31: @cosimia_ @DavidDeutschOxf Or "you should think independently". Or trying to train children to be creative in environments that systematically destroy creativity. Double-binds are crazy-making, and so while this is getting better in some places, it's getting worse in others.

https://t.co/mUdf7ZzNxv

2019-02-27 at 23:20:04: @cosimia_ @DavidDeutschOxf My model is that this situation has made the double-binds even more messy, because people are trying to use the old mode of thinking to install the new one. eg "I shouldn't say "should"."

(I'm full-time in a social lab oriented to how to train this thinking/culture shift.)

2019-02-27 at 23:15:05: @cosimia_ @DavidDeutschOxf DD describes how the Enlightenment began a shift to a dynamic society that updates its shared beliefs and practices (ie memes) based on what works and holds up under reflection, rather than insisting that they not change under any circumstances.

2019-02-27 at 23:07:49: @cosimia_ @DavidDeutschOxf My model (building on DD's) is that for some more recent period, it's been even worse. Previously there was a narrow range of okay behaviors. Might suck but at least you can do it.

Then there started to be double-binds: conflicting demands that you can't meet all at once.

2019-02-27 at 23:02:05: @cosimia_ @DavidDeutschOxf This emerged evolutionarily because it was an attractor: once your society forces you to not innovate, your society stays static because nobody has the space to experiment &amp; change it into a dynamic society.

And, unfortunately, this required repression of human desire.

2019-02-27 at 23:00:05: @cosimia_ Structure of society. @DavidDeutschOxf outlines this brilliantly in some of the last chapters of his book The Beginning of Infinity. Human prehistory is a story of increasingly powerful creativity being used to maintain totally static societies.

https://t.co/gZsC883Quu

2019-02-27 at 22:54:50: @cosimia_ Talked with @Conaw last fall and he pointed out that this is why role models are so important. It's not enough to have a sense of which behaviors will get you punished (btw: reward is just the temporary relief of punishment). You need to have a multi-dimensional destination.

2019-02-27 at 22:52:05: @cosimia_ But in 2D, you can already see that "away" is basically everywhere. Whereas with towardsness, you can hone in. As the # of dimensions gets large (and it's huge for most interesting things) the relative usefulness of awayness feedback gets tiny.

2019-02-27 at 22:45:53: @cosimia_ Part of the issue is (and this is why I say positive vs negative motivation are different in all systems) you can't AIM awayness based motivation. In 1-dimensional systems, this is fine because there's no aiming to do (as long as you don't go past the repulsor) https://t.co/vCPdZaeJHY

2019-02-27 at 22:43:05: @cosimia_ Very related:

https://t.co/lxIlW7intO

2019-02-27 at 22:40:28: @cosimia_ It seems that if people can narrow their view sufficiently, they can sometimes do it for short periods. Sex or food, for instance.

But trying to really think about the question "what do I want" quickly reveals that many people have no idea and are afraid to consider it.

2019-02-27 at 22:31:07: @cosimia_ This makes sense when dealing with real acute danger, but for some time now* humans have been living in tense states of chronic fear. Due to the power differential ☝ between fear &amp; desire, this makes desire-based motivation hard to tap

*(I've updated a few times about how long)

2019-02-27 at 22:27:47: @cosimia_ &gt; difference between negative and positive motivation?

Have thought lots about this. Seems there is, both inherently to any feedback system and specifics to human psychology implementation. It's adaptive for fear to overpower desire: those who don't flee don't survive.

2019-02-27 at 22:20:46: Green - everyone gets to say
Orange - science gets to say
Blue - the church gets to say
Red - the king gets to say

And maybe that Tier 2 also involves allowing for there to be different answers to the object-level &amp; meta-lvl questions: sometimes I get to say that you get to say.

2019-02-27 at 22:20:46: My impression is that these questions are one major thing that becomes more consciously-held, fluid, and contextual in the shift from what Spiral Dynamics calls Tier 1 (including traditionalism, modernism, postmodernism) to Tier 2 (metamodernism &amp; beyond)

2019-02-27 at 19:42:02: Who gets to say?

And who gets to say who gets to say?

2019-02-27 at 15:34:41: @reasonisfun ...the challenge with this though is that "I'm having a semantic reaction of" is just soo cumbersome compared to "I think" that it's really hard to adopt this terminology even though I really really like it.

"I'm semantic-reacting"?

Can we come up with a new word?
#neologisms

2019-02-27 at 15:31:49: @reasonisfun (I'm not yet sure if his switch from a verb (tho ~gerund) to a noun is critical. I'm generally in the "verb everything" camp but it might be that he's trying to point at something important. The structure of language matters more than vocab, so that wouldn't be surprising.)

2019-02-27 at 15:30:02: @reasonisfun I like the way Alfred Korzybski (of "The map is not the territory" fame) puts this:

There's no clear distinction between thinking and feeling. Both are part of a more general process he calls "semantic reactions".

2019-02-27 at 15:24:07: @davidmanheim @reasonisfun @DavidDeutschOxf In other words, if you could simply perform the act "believe X", then you already would be doing so.

(This is true for many actions, not just belief. Most things you do, particularly habits, are downstream of something, and those generators will resist arbitrary change.) #PCT

2019-02-27 at 15:21:20: @davidmanheim @reasonisfun @DavidDeutschOxf I think the point that Lulie's making is that such change is downstream of something else. One doesn't simply "make oneself believe in God." One first (usually) starts dating someone who believes in God, and *then* it makes sense to believe, oneself.

2019-02-19 at 15:41:06: @utotranslucence @dthorson @imogenheap You know, irony and sincerity 😜

When I posted my audio clip, I had to restrain myself from describing it as silly, because on one level it was but I didn't want to hypermodestly undermine the sense in which I was sincerely trying to point at something cool.

2019-02-19 at 05:44:12: @dthorson @imogenheap I'm also imagining that, say in an intro similar to the one I mocked up, you could overlay the weird sounds at the ends with clips taken from various episodes of people saying phrases like "contemplative practice" and "metamodernity" and "liminal space" and "memetic mediators"...

Although less about the author and more about the model, I guess. I haven't bought everything by him but immediately bought like 6 other books (some by him) about PCT.

2019-02-18 at 16:13:31: @reasonisfun I'd be very interested to hear your perspective on the book The Guru Papers, which talks about the structural factors that lead to cults being culty, even if they don't set out to be (&amp; connects it with parental authoritarianism too)

My team calls this "100% co-responsibility". There's no 50/50, or 70/30. Nothing to divvy up. *Everyone* has full response-ability for their choices in the situation.

2019-02-14 at 20:30:23: @visakanv Oh man, I've been thinking about this a lot lately. "More" probably depends on the person, but I think it generalizes that these are surprisingly different desires, compared to how similar they look. (And "more" might be true in &gt;50%, even &gt;90% of cases)

gife: an act of giving

2019-02-11 at 23:28:27: @scott_moyer *points at the word "new" in my original tweet*

If rife and fife were workable, people wouldn't be using "strife" so much.

2019-02-11 at 23:08:21: Seriously, I bet the number of times that the word "strife" has been used in poems &amp; songs, compared with the number of times it would have been used if bife, mife, tife, pife, vife, and gife were all common words, is probably a ratio of like 10:1.

2019-02-11 at 21:26:39: @KhazWolf @briandavidearp Anecdotally there seems to be solid correlations between people endorsing negative utilitarianism and being Depressed. NU is basically what happens when you let a Depressed brain do ethics from math.

2019-02-09 at 04:27:18: What originally brought me to twitter though was a remarkable parallel between two quotations, the first from the @ConversationUS article about Erik Olin Wright, and the second from an article by @MicheleZanini &amp; @ProfHamel where they quote the CFO of the Chinese company Haier:

2019-02-09 at 04:27:18: The connection there is that by seeing what is so and nurturing it to grow more of what you want, you avoid conflict with parties who would feel defensive if you were to issue a critique of what you *don't* like about the status quo.

"Non-synoptic" means "not shared view" btw 👁️

2019-02-09 at 04:27:18: This approach of seeing and exalting what is already in line with the longer-term vision, connects with this abstract "Towards a Concept of Normative Incrementalism: One Prospect for Purposeful Non-synoptic Change In Highly Fragmented Social Systems"

2019-02-08 at 15:43:53: This thread is exceedingly meta-since the original @GRITCULT / @i_amm_nobody threads linked were about this concept for a better interface for twitter that I've had. My interest in that continues growing as I think about it more and user twitter more.

https://t.co/uzePO4f8F6

2019-02-08 at 15:43:52: That desc also reminds me of @vgr's Future Nauseous &amp; normalcy field concepts. Twitter is like a commercial airplane. It's capable of incredible shared-meaning-making possibilities; due to general pressures, reins itself in to avoid people getting queasy.

2019-02-08 at 15:43:52: Wow, check out that description. Surreal. Could probably apply to twitter.

(I notice as I'm saying "Wow" that my body &amp; facial expression appear relatively neutral, as they were a few minutes ago. This created a question of "is my wow authentic?" ... &amp; I'll just leave this here)

2019-02-08 at 15:43:52: There's the Gruen Effect, which talks about this in the context of malls.

2019-02-08 at 15:43:52: I have no idea why Twitter doesn't add such a feature. Okay, fine, I do 🙃Maybe it's political stuff re "subtweeting". Maybe it would be a tipping point of too-much-complexity for most (particularly new) users

Maybe they *want* you to get lost. Maybe it's good for selling ads.

2019-02-08 at 15:43:52: You can search the url of the tweet and find references, but you have to know to search it, and it's still cumbersome.

This tweet, this very tweet, could be referenced a thousand times in other tweets and you'd never know to look at it. But that changes the context!

2019-02-08 at 15:43:51: This whole thing is a total mess though, in part because synthesis is very hard, and in part because there's no easy way to see which tweets are linked elsewhere. So you can go deeper down the rabbit hole into the past &amp; the sources, but there isn't a button to jump UP. ☁️

2019-02-08 at 15:43:51: On its own, the above tweet embed will (I think) just render as another url. This is pure structure. And yet it's not just 301 redirects. It matters that I linked you to this particular locus in the rhizome, not the once-dereferenced version. https://t.co/abeIKnZsp6

Kratos today it is. Or whatever resonates with the deep purpose.

2019-02-01 at 05:34:25: Doing a Kratos workout 3× a week is my fallback, but I've also been doing acroyoga, rock climbing, and ecstatic dance.

2019-02-01 at 05:34:25: So then, having gotten clear on that, I decided that I would.

That no form of busyness or other constraints were worth compromising on that. (Even if sick or injured, I would want to challenge my other body parts or do lots of therapeutic movement).

2019-02-01 at 05:34:25: Just did a workout.

("Kratos" Bodyweight HIT by @DrewBaye if you're curious)

2019-01-26 at 19:18:59: @visakanv I love the reflections, eg "I knew I was supposed to be mad, but I didn't even know why"

2019-01-23 at 06:01:58: @Johnny_Uzan (Or just trying to get through 100s of days.)

So then the decade scale. Most ppl don't even *have* a 10-year vision, let alone a tame one. W/o a 10y big-picture purpose, it's hard make tough decisions of which year-long projs to pursue. which'll take 2 years, but be worth it.

2019-01-23 at 05:57:53: @Johnny_Uzan And people usually aren't trying to achieve a THING with their day, they're trying to get a dozen random things done, each of which will take more time than is estimated.

Similarly, most people aren't trying to achieve a THING with their year, they're just doing 1000s of things.

2019-01-23 at 05:56:03: @Johnny_Uzan Let's examine on a smaller scale: "goal for this hour overambitious; goal for today tame". Lots of substantial projects can be achieved in the span of a day if you take them seriously. But also trying to get some chunk of that done can easily take more than the hour you envision.

2019-01-22 at 22:51:50: @utotranslucence @eriktorenberg @_TamaraWinter @SarahAMcManus It's not just that—a mother of three (12,14,18) I was talking with last night was describing the contemporary social norm (even in a safe city in Canada) of knowing where your kid is at at all times. Which requires them to have a caretaker, a role that school fills.

2019-01-22 at 22:50:08: @utotranslucence @eriktorenberg @_TamaraWinter @SarahAMcManus Current models of psychotherapy also sometimes restrict people in support groups (eg DBT for BPD) from connecting outside of the support groups, due to privacy etc concerns.

...which both reinforces the stigma and also prevents natural therapy after the program ends! 4⃣

2019-01-22 at 22:49:08: @utotranslucence @eriktorenberg @_TamaraWinter @SarahAMcManus The paradox: clinical therapy relies on forced separation of the lives of the therapist and client. At 20+ hours of therapy per week, you are clearly part of your therapist's life &amp; vv.

So getting that level of trauma therapy *requires* it to be part of every day life. 3⃣

2019-01-22 at 22:49:00: @utotranslucence @eriktorenberg @_TamaraWinter @SarahAMcManus I told my dad that my involvement in this project was giving me equiv of 20h therapy/week. He said "I don't think it's healthy for anyone to get that much therapy."

2019-01-22 at 22:48:50: @utotranslucence @eriktorenberg @_TamaraWinter @SarahAMcManus Yeah you could describe what we're working on as being a "naturally therapeutic culture"—a term that I might be getting from the last chapter of Kegan's The Evolving Self which is "Natural Therapy" 😉

2019-01-13 at 16:55:39: @ToKTeacher The resolution to the paradox being, as I said, that that overlap is fighting internally over which side to fight for.

And the whole thing is fractal! Static societies are built on people being systematically blocked from resolving these conflicts, due to irrational meme traumas

2019-01-13 at 16:50:51: @ToKTeacher I also think that being able to say 55% is fighting 55% does something important to a mind used to percents, as it generates a paradox: where did the extra 10% come from?

Whereas just saying "more than half" doesn't create the paradox as instantly as
  55% + 55% &gt; 100% 🤨

2019-01-13 at 16:27:11: @reasonisfun @ToKTeacher Reminds me of BoI... rational &amp; irrational memes.

I deliberately copied the numbers of the 10% meme to make my variant memetically competitive against original myth, which means relying on my followers' critical faculties to interpret it into something that's better still :)

2019-01-13 at 16:23:53: @reasonisfun @ToKTeacher I resonate with Brett's experience of being frustrated and distrustful when people use numbers in ways that are misleading. In this situation I felt it would be sufficiently clear that I was being playful with the numbers rather than literal.

2019-01-12 at 23:24:32: @davidarredondo I've read most of BoI now...

https://t.co/5BqEcVyzyj

2019-01-12 at 23:12:12: The solution is to find another strategy to meet the high-level goals, such as calling the friends to say you'll be late, or even trusting that in fact your friends won't shun you just because you were (if that's true). Or choosing one option, to resolve the conflict.

2019-01-12 at 23:12:11: It's impossible to go both 86 &amp; 60mph at the same time, but so if the conflict goes unresolved the person ends up going 78mph, which neither gets them there on time NOR under the speed limit 🤔

Note that the high-level goals don't necessarily conflict, but the medium ones do.

2019-01-12 at 23:12:11: Fighting = trying to achieve different ends in a way that contradicts.

eg a person who is late driving somewhere:

2 high-level goals "friends not mad at me", "don't get arrested"
↳ 2 medium-level goals "don't be late", "don't speed"
↳ 2 contradicting 🚗 speeds: 86mph, 60mph

2019-01-12 at 23:04:42: @ToKTeacher Totally made up numbers. The point of the 55% vs 55% is that even peoples' conflicts have conflicts!

(My understanding of this stuff largely comes from the last chapter of William T. Powers' book Behavior: The Control of Perception, which lays this out really clearly.)

2019-01-10 at 23:48:42: I published a new blog post, describing how trying to figure out what to do by asking "what am I behind on?" is fundamentally a confusion.

2019-01-08 at 17:29:11: @SamoBurja On further reflection it was apparent that that non-attachment concept was clearly enabling ways in which I was putting our relationship at stake to get what I wanted.

My current sense of integrity is that I wouldn't continue to be in a relationship I was willing to do that to.

2019-01-08 at 17:28:57: @SamoBurja When listening to it, I found myself initially defending that I had done that, speaking about how my former partner was too attached. But then the people I listened to it with pointed at how I was attached to my concept of myself as non-attached.

2019-01-08 at 17:28:51: @SamoBurja Oh man this was totally me for awhile. In 2017 I found an old audio-journal from 2012 in which I was reflecting on a convo that day about letting go of attachment. That convo I think partly inspired me to lean into detached tendencies in relationship that I already had.

2019-01-08 at 17:16:49: @eriktorenberg @garybasin And we haven't even gotten to the part where many many many real situations are not zero-sum games like prisoner's dilemmas (or if they are, it's on a level of abstraction nobody is tracking). People tend to value each others' experience at least somewhat; game theory assumes no.

2019-01-08 at 17:12:31: @eriktorenberg @garybasin It makes a difference to get more clear about what's being expected, and why, so that you can respond to expectation-reality gaps with awareness and inquiry rather than outrage and punishment.

2019-01-08 at 17:10:06: @eriktorenberg @garybasin Another piece... sometimes someone tries to hold you accountable for doing something that you never agreed to do. They generated an expectation, from some concept of you or their relationship to you ("of course you should X, you're my girlfriend!")

2019-01-08 at 17:06:29: @eriktorenberg @garybasin Well if you defect, you'd be a *defector*, and you don't want to be a *defector*, do you?

Whereas talking about "defect" as being the label, creates more space to ask "why did someone do that?" without invoking blame or judgment.

That's one piece of it.

2019-01-08 at 17:04:19: @webdevMason Here's a post (some of my best work so far, people tell me) that lays out a bunch of nuances around what it means to avoid blame &amp; regret without losing your agency &amp; responsibility.

https://t.co/MyrnAM9ELD

2019-01-08 at 17:02:38: @robertskmiles @webdevMason (Note that not everyone would necessarily want to say this. My full-time project at the moment is building post-blame cultures, so I'm on the extreme end of this.)

That said, post-blame relating seems to be necessary for consistently feedback flow, hence for effective teamwork.

2019-01-08 at 17:01:23: @robertskmiles @webdevMason I'd say "You made a reasonable bet" there... bringing right/wrong into it at all is bringing in the whole blame structure, even if just to deny it.

(This can be worth doing explicitly, but saying "you're not to blame" implies that if they made a different decision they would be)

2019-01-08 at 16:58:57: It's entirely possible to avoid taking on blame without losing your agency and response-ability. And... it can take a paradigm shift from how we've been raised to think, particularly to do it consistently. https://t.co/nYFg1bHbnh

2019-01-07 at 05:56:13: @cognazor @jaredjanes @peternlimberg Excellent! Yeah, let's chat. Looking forward to seeing what emerges from the podcast! Lmk when it's live :)

2019-01-07 at 00:12:05: (Also: if it takes 20 years for there to be job openings for memetic mediators, we're probably screwed. Not that it has to have that specific name of course, but that structural role &amp; concept.)

2019-01-07 at 00:11:50: And if you think "could that be me?" (I'm talking to you specifically, @cognazor, as well as anyone else who reads this tweet) then I would love to talk with you. I'm interested in financial independence in general, and also the world needs pro memetic mediators.
5⃣

2019-01-07 at 00:11:41: Will any of these be easy? Nope. Blazing new trails never is. So I'll second @cognazor's "Good luck"—'cause you'll need some.

But I contest his "it's not gonna happen." I absolutely think this is very possible for someone who is committed and has enough runway to get started.
4⃣

2019-01-07 at 00:10:31: But off the top of my head here's 3 ways you might be able to make a living while playing a memetic mediator role:
• do it publicly or semi-publicly (a podcast?) &amp; have a patreon
• get funding from a grant (as an org?)
• find an organization that doesn't know it needs you
3⃣

2019-01-07 at 00:10:31: This is a great chance to deconstruct the difference between "apply for a job opening as" and "make a living as". There are no job openings for memetic mediator—I checked, to make sure:

2019-01-06 at 23:23:52: @garybasin I'm wanting to point at the difference between talking about "defecting" and talking about "choosing the option that game theorists call DEFECT".

You have a different conversation depending on how you talk about it.

2019-01-06 at 23:22:41: @garybasin "Cooperate" &amp; "Defect" are connotationally rich names for moves in particular situations. Sometimes (eg in ~stag-hunt) you might not be able to afford to "cooperate". Other times you may not even know which option is which.

Choosing opt labelled "defect" isn't always punishment.

Starts with Google Payments, then a dozen links to the billing pages of SaaS sites.

2019-01-04 at 22:48:45: @alexeyguzey I wouldn't be super surprised if, in a multi-month solo retreat context where my schedule was easy to control, I found myself on a 4.5h+2nap or maybe even 3h+3nap schedule, and that were relatively sustainable. 3nap probably suboptimal, but 2nap might be as workable as 1nap.

2019-01-04 at 22:45:02: @alexeyguzey My new model of things includes a moderate-to-significant hypomania/hyperthymia component, where more manic sorts of times are characterized by less sleep and lower-energy times by more, and these moods &amp; sleep cycles are mutually reinforcing until something breaks.

2019-01-04 at 22:43:48: @alexeyguzey Ummm... I don't remember everyman deets, tbh. I'm pretty sure that a sufficient factor for it breaking was that when I moved timezones I accidentally put my first nap an hour earlier which made it too close to my core (~2.5h after ish). No model I know says that's a good idea.

2019-01-04 at 22:42:33: @alexeyguzey But also totally different from that. The point is, the kind of happy loopy drunk sleep dep seems characteristic of "I haven't gotten enough REM sleep the last day or two" but there's a qualitatively different thing (😑→🧱-wall) that happens after days of no SWS.

2019-01-04 at 22:40:52: @alexeyguzey Sorta like hunger and thirst.
REM dep is like thirst—if you model your body as having reserves, they can only last a day or so before things start going weird.
SWS dep is like hunger—fasting for a day, you feel it, but after a few days it's like WHOA.

2019-01-04 at 22:38:23: @alexeyguzey Maybe, but I don't think so. I still needed the alarm to get up after ~8h, iirc, whereas when I'm napping consistently I reasonably often just wake up after about 6h.

2019-01-04 at 17:50:06: @fortelabs Yeah, summit sounds great. @jamesnorris_ &amp; I ran an event 3 years ago called Focus Week where we got a bunch of people in a house for a week to do deep work. I think he ran a summit a year later or something?

I could imagine a pretty cool bootcamp / longer in-person intensive.

Happy New Year whereever you are this weekend 😎

2019-01-04 at 08:26:29: I would also be down to help somebody else design or execute a similar workshop structure for something they know how to teach and think would work well with this format 🙃

It works particularly well for things where people want accountability, but could be anything really.

2019-01-04 at 08:26:29: So yeah! I'm hoping to get a chance to talk with @fortelabs &amp; @TaylorPearsonMe about their experience running this structure of event, as part of learning how to design future video/chat/solo hybrid workshops.

2019-01-04 at 08:26:29: I wasn't worried about losing customers (huge space, ~separate mktg channels).

So instead, this is a cool opportunity for us to compare variations and see how they each go!

Main differences:
• duration (5h vs full-day)
• # coaches (many vs 2)
• $ / PWYW
• the actual content

2019-01-04 at 08:26:29: As the surprise wore off... I wondered if I was upset... or... was I supposed to be upset?

But then on reflection, I felt mostly a mix of:
• curious (was this intentional or did it bubble up from his subconscious?)
• flattered ("imitation is the sincerest form of")
• excited!

2019-01-04 at 08:26:28: I was thinking it was likely he wouldn't be interested in coaching, but figured our workshop format was something he'd appreciate anyway and that maybe I'd see him try it for his PKM content.

I was surprised that it's... the same concept/purpose, the same weekend.

2019-01-04 at 08:26:28: Is this a coincidence? I'm genuinely not sure. I do know that last year I emailed @fortelabs and told him about our event, because I thought he'd appreciate the pedagogical approach we were taking, which (as far as I know) is a rather unique structure: https://t.co/qfJj9hvc67

2019-01-04 at 08:26:28: Similarities
• virtual workshop
• Zoom video call
• hours of Slack-based Q&amp;A etc
• time for private reflection
• group accountability
• much more course content than you can actually use during this one event

...and of course the purpose: review last year &amp; plan next year

2019-01-04 at 08:26:28: Also only about 24 hours to buy @fortelabs' &amp; @TaylorPearsonMe New Year's bundle which includes... a remarkably similar event—that's also this weekend!

2019-01-03 at 00:04:07: @dela3499 In terms of writing lyrics of songs, I look up to Barenaked Ladies, Jason Mraz, Leonard Cohen, and others.

I would say BNL were metamodern before that was even a thing, managing to say things in a simultaneously deeply sincere and deeply ironic way.

2019-01-03 at 00:02:22: @dela3499 I'll probably get into it at some point. I beatbox, and sonically, my main idol is probably... beardyman, who can do amazing stuff both with just his voice, and also with electronic fx.

I kind of envy more electric/electronic musicians their precise soundscape control. I'm into that.

2019-01-02 at 22:29:53: @dela3499 I really like the mix of the short Nile-Rodgers-esque licks underneath the really ambient floaty reverb guitar. And how they seem to be together at the start of each bar or two, but then one continues licking and the other continues floating.

2019-01-02 at 22:08:36: @wrathofgnon Prior to modernish era, probably often that-which-was-not-designed was inherited/evolved, so it still got some good optimization pressure.

But modernish era of design starts from scratch or fashion instead of tradition, so that-which-is-not-designed just gets no thought at all.

2019-01-02 at 22:05:21: @wrathofgnon Most objects have a few parts designed, or they couldn't get sold at all.

2019-01-02 at 22:00:49: @wrathofgnon (I think part of why I say "most things are not designed" is because I have the impression that most human-made objects are terrible in ways that nobody could have possibly intended if they'd thought about it *literally at all*.)

2018-12-27 at 00:22:26: @reasonisfun None of this is intended to contradict what you're saying about pain/discomfort being a valid critique (get warm clothes for the winter walk!)... wanting to add another layer of questioning &amp; context-sensitivity.

Including eg a funeral isn't *supposed* to be happy.

2018-12-27 at 00:06:57: @reasonisfun So a workout regime (or Vipassana training; I am not familiar) might say "you are going to gain something you want by persisting through discomfort." If that's the claim, and you're uncomfortable, that's part of the process as offered. Though you might ask for a different path!

2018-12-27 at 00:04:55: @reasonisfun Hmm, this seems important, but I think the claim needs to be made more precise. Sometimes there's discomfort on the way to something you want, even if that's just a fact of nature (it's cold and snowy on the way to the store).

Any "path" needs to have parameters for "keep going"

This is one of the main engines that keeps us from being able to just fix coercion once we realize it's so dysfunctional and costly.) https://t.co/CnjLWTUdg9

2018-12-11 at 15:29:10: @reasonisfun @mattguttmanorg Mmm just to make sure I'm clear: you're referring to specific kinds of coercive meta discussion, like the ones you were arguing against here: https://t.co/qdMcgsvfWS

Meta-communication is critical to breaking out of double binds, hence critical to untangling coercive structures.

2018-12-11 at 15:24:28: @reasonisfun @LivingRmContext Yeah, definitely stages of making sense of this kind of thing.

Coercion in institutions definitely seems to stop error correction... framed in systems terms, it's: feedback flows become blocked because it's not safe for people to say what they really think.

I think that the part around the cynical replies being part of the same pattern is a really important thing to grok, because it shows up in so many places.

2018-12-09 at 04:02:22: @cognazor Yep, that too. A critique that needs to be engaged with not as "a reason to stop" but as "something to account for while steering this change". We don't have the option of stopping or going back!

2018-12-09 at 03:45:56: @cognazor Note: actually shifting a whole memeplex is *hard*. It would be very naïve to claim otherwise. But it is possible at least in principle, and we're fucked if we don't. So that makes it a priority, at least for me and the people I work with.

2018-12-09 at 03:44:21: @cognazor Yep. And consider the puzzle: "If gender roles are natural, why do people put effort into policing them?" plus "If they're being enforced by memetic selection, what effect would that have on genetic selection pressures?"

2018-12-09 at 03:09:22: @ben_r_hoffman @kevinakwok Aha, here's more: https://t.co/Cy47ImKfiA

2018-12-09 at 02:59:24: @cognazor I resonate with everything you're saying there except the word "naively". 

And I'll reveal that doubt your belief is that naïve either.

There's lots of evidence for the profound influence of memes on what is human-natural, not just genes. Just hard to diff without an alt.

2018-12-09 at 02:56:45: @ben_r_hoffman @kevinakwok Whoa! I'll experiment with each of these (and another I saw recommended: "suggest_pyle_tweet") to see which block most of what I want blocked.

2018-12-09 at 01:03:53: @impression28 @kevinakwok Holy shit yeah this is actually fantastic.

And it seems that it doesn't have any ads, unlike normal mobile twitter which is also a pretty high % of those.

2018-12-09 at 01:00:32: @then_there_was Seems wise at a high level, and... misses questions like "what if tech X and tech Y are divisive on their own, but integrative used in concert?"

2018-11-27 at 20:32:54: @devonzuegel I do most of this inside the productivity app I built, https://t.co/lRiGUxBh9B.

2018-11-17 at 00:59:54: @samgraver @AmandaGosling3 @vaiseys @djmgaffneyw4 The wikipage you linked shows many pairs of traits correlated, but even though those correlations are (reportedly) statistically significant, they may not actually be that _large._ And the 20+ things correlated with grip strength probably don't all correlate with each other.

2018-11-17 at 00:52:48: @samgraver @AmandaGosling3 @vaiseys @djmgaffneyw4 Hm? If we take the extreme case of 100% covariance among all traits, then the pilots who were in the middle 30% on one trait would also be in the middle 30% of other traits. Whereas the less covariance there is, the less this is true.

2018-11-13 at 00:06:17: @bryankam Yeah, seems similar another thing I was thinking about that didn't fit in the tweet of 5 above... basically "effectively focusing on this goal means mostly waiting and then responding effectively when certain things happen".

Ideas for what other workflows might look like?

2018-11-12 at 21:14:27: @DhruvaAliman What are you sampling in this? Obviously the same one as in C2C's Delta, but I can't find it on https://t.co/sYPHZEoySX!

(I briefly thought maybe the vocals on this were yours and they sampled you, but the timing doesn't make sense since theirs came out in 2012)

2018-11-12 at 21:06:25: 7/ Are there other workflows for goals? How can a productivity system best guide its users to the right kind of work on each goal? How can it help people identify which goals are which?

I'm interested in your thoughts!

2018-11-12 at 21:06:25: 6/ But then for a habit/routine goal, days off should be rare, and the system should help the user reflect on the choices that contribute to adherence.

And for a 2h/day goal, the system should help the user come up with what to spend that time doing that feels worth tackling.

2018-11-12 at 21:06:24: 5/ With a deep-work-session goal, the emphasis should be on helping the user set aside a day or an afternoon for that work. Target is 6 day-offs &amp; 1 enough per week.

Day job expects 5 enoughs of course, &amp; actually taking the other 2 days off is often itself part of the goal! 😉

2018-11-12 at 21:06:24: 4/ I'm considering adding an explicit thing to https://t.co/lRiGUxBh9B for specifying desired kind of focus for each goal, to better guide people towards that focus.

eg answering "is this enough?" with "yes/no/day-off"—those answers mean different things depending on context!

2018-11-12 at 21:06:24: 3/ ...and some combinations of the above. When I recorded an album in 2012, it was a mix of 2 &amp; 5, practicing and then spending a day in the studio. Plus of course choosing which songs to record, designing the cover art, etc.
(The album: https://t.co/zOxu4wU2tb)

2018-11-12 at 21:06:24: 2/ Some sample answers to focus question:
1. ~mon-fri 9-5 (eg day job)
2. a few hours every day (eg blogging)
3. a few key habits (eg health goal)
4. every moment (eg mindset goal)
5. periodic deep work sessions (eg one full day each week writing/coding)
6. &lt; what else?? &gt;

2018-11-12 at 21:06:23: 1/ Some thinking I'm doing today re the core @CompliceGoals question "Is [what I did today] enough?"

For different goals, people would have different answers to "how often &amp; how much do you need to work at this goal?" or "what workflow constitutes effective focus on this goal?" https://t.co/U8KGQPoCaC

2018-10-14 at 00:25:23: @Hugoisms Sure, if you could place your votes so precisely. In practice each voter gets to express 1-3 bits of preference each election, and every party has distasteful stuff about them, so most factors don't make the cut for changing the decision.

Implicit coalitions exist in 2-party systems *anyway*.

2018-10-09 at 23:56:52: @Hugoisms 2 parties does necessitate evolution, but diffs at the margins get dramatically magnified because of the extent to which there's a large number of ppl who always vote for one party or the other, and because of the extent to which ppl are voting fearfully rather than hopefully. https://t.co/1Ak9cUb9Kx

This thread has given me a more nuanced appreciation of there being some sort of distinction here though, so thanks for that 🙃

2018-10-08 at 05:34:31: @_awbery_ @selfprime @DavidDeutschOxf Meta discussion-based taboos, eg "why don't we discuss the reasons for our taboos?" might be biological in the sense that if ppl discussed them they might decide eg to remove the taboo against sibling-mating, and then the genetics will get them. Hallmark of unconscious culture.

2018-10-08 at 05:31:54: @_awbery_ @selfprime @DavidDeutschOxf Going back to @selfprime's original question, I do think that any taboo on *discussing* something must necessarily be cultural, because discussion is a cultural thing so there's no way that a non-verbal primate could *need* a biological taboo about it.

2018-10-08 at 05:29:49: @_awbery_ @selfprime @DavidDeutschOxf Ahh, yeah. There's taboos that if we didn't have them we would die for biological reasons (or like, pregnant women not eating eels is a real example). In other species (or earlier hominids) this might have been a biological aversion, but sometimes no need with a cultural taboo.

2018-10-06 at 18:34:35: @selfprime All taboos are cultural.

(My understanding of the nature of cultural evolution comes primarily from The Secret of Our Success by Joseph Henrich and The Beginning of Infinity by @DavidDeutschOxf)

2018-10-06 at 18:30:32: @kevinakwok Reminds me of the difference between exponential distribution &amp; power law distribution. Data looks similar, but w exp, mean converges w more data, whereas w p-law, mean goes to infinity because of black swans in the fat tail. Is that what you're thinking of or something else? https://t.co/bDxnFGFf8l

2018-10-06 at 18:23:40: @visakanv And "inheritance" here is more memetic inheritance than genetic inheritance.

2018-10-06 at 18:21:47: @visakanv I'd be down to host a page on my site that summarizes such recommendations. I imagine that the data could also be turned into a sort of bot that can take in a tweet-long description of your situation and come up with a decent reco.

2018-07-25 at 19:15:23: 2/ To be clear: I'm aware that Descartes *did* have a whole naïve dualism thing going on, but it seems to me that "we cannot doubt of our existence while we doubt...." (as he later put it) is a pretty solid point despite that.

Am I missing something?

2018-06-20 at 22:22:21: One significant aspect of this shift, also, is that the negative costs of not following these "norms" isn't enacted by punishment, but just by the natural consequence of "things don't work as well when you put sand in the gears".

2018-06-20 at 22:21:10: For broad "norms", this of course only works for things that everyone can agree on, which tend to be basically at the mindset level. Although within a small team, you could also have a shared understanding that "if we do X, the plane (/project) will crash and burn"

2018-06-20 at 22:17:12: The basic, somewhat counter-intuitive explanation of this shift is that norms become non-normative, simply descriptive.

If a group has a shared understanding that behavior X → outcome Y, and knows they prefer outcome Z, they can reasonably trust each other not to do X.

2018-06-20 at 22:15:02: Someone once asked: "So at the culture-building project you're part of, you have different norms?"
...and I said "it's less about 'different norms' and more about 'a different understanding of how norms work'"

This shifted understanding dramatically reduces both kinds of costs. https://t.co/j9XscY352Q

2018-05-19 at 23:22:32: @Meaningness @StephenPiment Right, also this! The importance of context.

Perhaps one could even gesture at "contextualizing" as an even larger move than "operationalizing".

2018-05-19 at 23:16:07: @Meaningness @StephenPiment (and yeah, this again comes back to the motte&amp;bailey thing. You ARE saying the map isn't the territory, but you aren't JUST saying that the map isn't the territory, in the sense of "only saying the obvious simple true thing")

2018-05-19 at 23:11:56: @Meaningness @StephenPiment Well, so far nobody seems to have written a better introduction to General Semantics than Science &amp; Sanity, so it's about fucking time!

2018-05-19 at 23:10:58: @Meaningness @StephenPiment Rationalists get around this using the tool "operationalize".

So the debate needs to become about a real question:
"does it look like a chair to me?"
"can I sit comfortably on it?"
"do &gt;70% of strangers call it a chair?"

or simply "do I choose to call this a chair?"

2018-05-19 at 23:02:55: @Meaningness @StephenPiment I mean, Korzybski would claim that saying "this is a chair" is a M-T error, because "is" is busted.

And people DO get in (usually useless) debates about whether some particular X "is" a Y. They wouldn't do this if they weren't making this M-T error.

2018-05-19 at 23:00:17: @Meaningness @garybasin @StephenPiment Unclear if I would have endorsed it as a thing that was possible once the matter was brought to light, but I at least somewhat would have been acting as though that were a thing.

2018-05-19 at 22:58:37: @Meaningness @garybasin @StephenPiment Hm, somewhat obvious, but the uhh... mapping from literal maps &amp; territories to the more general case maybe less so.

eg "overarching universal ontology, combining all possible categorizations" seems like sthg I might have vaguely thought was possible before reading Meaningness

2018-05-19 at 22:44:16: @Meaningness @StephenPiment I tried it 4 years ago and couldn't manage it them. Those years of experience and further reading have made a difference I think.

2018-05-19 at 22:40:16: @StephenPiment @Meaningness I sense a motte&amp;bailey-esque thing here (except not so antagonistic as the central uses of that term).

There's an obvious simple true thing that TMINTT means, &amp; most people stop with that one when looking, then go back to making map-territory muddles when not paying attention.

2018-05-19 at 22:32:17: @StephenPiment @Meaningness However, most people who try to point at these confusions have trouble, because they're ontological confusions and people tend to interpret incoming words as meaning something within their current ontology, rather than pointing at how it could be different.

2018-05-19 at 22:29:40: @StephenPiment @Meaningness I recently spent a few hours w/ the original source (Korzybski's Science &amp; Sanity) and it gave me the impression that while current zeitgeist has partially just digested this insight, there are fundamental pieces missing. Most people are full of confusions that TMINTT negates.

2018-04-30 at 05:40:23: @fortelabs Oh man, I want this experience. I instead have a feeling of everything being deeply intertwingled, with circular dependencies. I need to write A before B, B before C, and C before A. It's not literally true but that's the feeling.

Not sure if answer is superstructure or play.

2018-04-29 at 20:58:45: @fortelabs Was this true of you 5-10 years ago? Is it something that you observed about yourself, or did you deliberately make yourself this way?

I ask because I've been thinking about throughput &amp; writing (which of course is something you've pointed at) &amp; wondering about different styles.

2018-04-25 at 00:00:35: @fortelabs I like them. It's someone who's written a post that links back to one of your posts.

Maybe your confusion is that WordPress wants you to approve pingbacks when you link to one of your own posts. Should be an "always"/"never" setting (maybe there is; I haven't looked hard).

2018-04-18 at 06:07:02: "Notwithstanding" is a cool word. At first glance, you might think that something that does "not withstand" something else would be succumbing to it. On the contrary, it seems to be pointing at something aikido-flavored: more like "not getting into a fight with" #etymology

2018-04-15 at 14:44:37: @vgr This resonates a little with @michael_nielsen's reference to the Odyssey &amp; Ulysses pact, and perhaps less obviously but more deeply with @vgr's "commitmentality": etymologically speaking, "commit" means "throw together". Two beings with a shared trajectory through life.

2018-04-15 at 14:38:38: @vgr Thinking about this further, when I imagine the job fair/speed-dating event, there's this metaphor of people being prepared or even zealous to "jump on the boat" with each other or something. And once you're on a boat you're kind of stuck with the other people on the boat.

2018-04-15 at 04:46:44: @vgr "Poise" is another word I've used to point at optionality. It's like how someone who is physically poised can readily move in any direction.

That suggests an opposite like "bracedness", "load-bearing-ness"... still not coming up with anything elegant :-/

2018-04-15 at 04:44:51: @vgr Obligality? Vestedness? Locked-in-ness?

I definitely see the shape of what you're pointing at, but I don't have a good name for that shape.

Wanting-certainty/predictability is sort of the thing too...

2018-04-15 at 04:38:29: @BenMosior I pick a different one each time, playing/punning on the theme of the email. Not actually. Well, I do in mail-merges though where it's worth spending that much time because 1000+ people will read it.

It's also exciting to see old feature requests for things I've since implemented.

2018-04-14 at 21:09:16: I'm going through a massive @CompliceGoals support backlog, and it's kind of disheartening to read messages like "Thank you so much. I am so grateful for this website. It will definitely help me in my life daily. Thank you!!!" and then seeing the user never logged on again.

2018-04-13 at 14:52:46: @visakanv I have a thing like that, also in workflowy. The fact that I recognized that there was a way to intentionally get myself out of the type of headspace I'd been in made it so that I could never quite get stuck in it in the same way in the future.

2018-03-28 at 21:48:11: @dehowell @fortelabs Although there are several kinds of inaction... some are well-captured by "dream", but others are more like "I really truly want this thing and also I am in conflict about it and the conflict prevents me from taking any action towards it."

2018-01-22 at 15:39:33: @jesswatmiller @visakanv @Meaningness These models may be more similar than they appear on the surface; the only way to make it *not* a willpower thing for most people is to change one's identity in a pretty serious way, and... yeah, people don't want to do that either.

2018-01-22 at 08:03:01: @visakanv @Meaningness &amp; I'm guessing for most people "isn't worth" is less of a moral claim and more like "I don't think I could do it"

this is of course to the extent that people are thinking about the territory at all, and not just virtue signalling because "slaughterhouse" sounds like a Bad Thing

2018-01-22 at 08:00:29: @visakanv @Meaningness Synthetic meat is one endgame. But I think on a different level it's actually just a willpower thing.

2018-01-17 at 19:06:40: @fortelabs @OlliTiainen Really? I don't expect people to have read Stealing Fire but I thought Mihaly Csikzsentmihalyi's work was pretty well-known, and also that he himself *got* the term flow from the people he studied, many of whom independently used it to describe their experience of highQ work

2018-01-17 at 19:01:33: 9/ So yeah. Going forward, I think I'm going to be a lot more clear about where I want to create a partnership, and not kind of having half-relationships with people who I'm not intrinsically stoked to connect with!

2018-01-17 at 19:01:33: 8/ The past half-year on Twitter has been very much the opposite. I'm getting a lot more focused on it being a place for conversation with people I respect, admire, am curious about, and have something to say to—something *I* am excited to say.

2018-01-17 at 19:01:32: 7/ Note that I think the virtual coworking rooms *are* really valuable and could be a huge value-add for each of the communities that I joined. So it's not that I was being selfish.

But I was being kind of deceptive in my motives, and that wore on me a bit.

2018-01-17 at 19:01:32: 6/ Finally I conceded that I needed to cut my loses and unsubscribe from those communities until at least I had a better plan for how to pitch the virtual coworking rooms to them.

2018-01-17 at 19:01:31: 5/ Over the span of 6 months I spent several hundred $$ on subscriptions to paid-only communities, and only actually engaged a small bit. Kept thinking "I should engage before trying to sell" but didn't actually want to engage much, so was stuck.

2018-01-17 at 19:01:31: 4/ I did something really similar awhile back with online communities: One not-very-prominent feature of my app @CompliceGoals is that it has virtual pomodoro coworking rooms. And I kept joining various online communities hoping that I could get the communities to make a room

2018-01-17 at 19:01:31: 3/ And this actually just ended up creating a kind of vague guilty feeling when I would see them in my timeline, because I kept feeling like "Oh I should talk with these people to build those relationships" but I didn't actually have much to say.

2018-01-17 at 19:01:30: 2/ On one level this makes sense: build relationships that can be leveraged for mutual benefit (eg being on someone's podcast). But on another level I realize now that I wasn't actually interested in that person or what they were saying or what we could talk about together!

2018-01-17 at 18:53:43: 1/ Am currently unfollowing more people to curate the conversational feed that I want to have. One thing I'm shocked by is the number of people past-me followed in the idea that I'd interact with them and eventually ask a favor of them or something like that.

2018-01-17 at 18:32:24: @OlliTiainen @fortelabs Relatedly, I might suggest replacing "pleasure" with "flow", which has several advantages:
- captures what is pleasurable about working without suggesting leisure
- alliteration with "freedom"
- is associated with high-focus states, without sounding unpleasant

2018-01-14 at 20:34:21: @sehurlburt @xernobyl @COmm0x41NDOr Yeah. This is discussed in @lToddRose's book The End of Average, where he describes it having come from a naïve belief that intelligence was 1-dimensional and that if you didn't get it at the average pace you were never going to get it. Or something. It's a good book!

2018-01-14 at 20:24:29: @chenoehart One question that I often come back to that seems relevant to this, is

2018-01-12 at 00:27:39: @Meaningness @AlexiSargeant I think it's worth noting that Alexi was kind of writing from an anthropological perspective, and that also I was not per se attempting to write a *reply* so much as a series of reflections.

2018-01-11 at 06:09:12: @drethelin It's a term that's gotten a bit burnt (probably by some postmodernists) but the *useful* meaning I know of is of a view of differences that doesn't hold them in opposition but rather as interpenetrating things, each containing the other.

2018-01-03 at 17:56:25: @chris_mahan @mattgoldenberg My general read is that someone who was stage 5 would tend to phrase their principle in a more context-sensitive way, and not in terms of "right thing to do".

But there are—very unfortunately—not that many stage 5 people around! So my sample size is small.

2018-01-03 at 17:52:39: @chris_mahan @mattgoldenberg Someone who was stage 4 could say "kindness, love, and compassion are always the right thing to do." and this would be their own personal principle—not even a trusted authority could cause them to question it.

This seems more like what you were saying ("true for me" etc)

2018-01-03 at 17:50:47: @chris_mahan @mattgoldenberg Someone who was stage 3 could say "kindness, love, and compassion are always the right thing to do." but for them it would be a kind of received wisdom, and it would be unquestionable because of the unquestionability of the authority of whereever it came from.

2018-01-03 at 17:47:28: @chris_mahan @mattgoldenberg It's impossible to gauge someone's CDT level (or any subject-object matter) from a single sentence fragment. That said, I would be quite surprised if someone who was stage 2 or stage 5 would have said what you did.

2017-12-31 at 21:42:37: @garybasin @vgr @Meaningness @TaylorPearsonMe @mistermircea @KevinSimler I think that understanding the role of internal conflict is really important here.

2017-12-31 at 21:20:14: @KevinSimler @garybasin Probably a better mapping is "unconscious"/"conscious" instead of S1/S2. So an unconscious need is something that your system will in fact act to ensure it gets, whereas a conscious need is something that your conscious mind thinks it needs (which you might not actually seek!)

2017-12-31 at 21:14:12: @garybasin Perceptual Control Theory strongly supports a view similar to this. Each person's control hierarchy has various reference levels (some of which are ~hardcoded, eg temp, hunger, meaning) &amp; at any moment either the reference levels are ✓ or their ctrl hierarchy is reorganizing

2017-11-07 at 05:27:41: @chaosprime @suchaone @VesselOfSpirit I did it once a few years ago; was pretty straightforward. I used some tool... *googles* maybe EncloseJS? Sounds like there's better now

2017-11-07 at 05:26:11: Seems like it could also be a cool tool for doing facets work like @byudkowsky does.

(See https://t.co/2iDCyJkcNm for "what are facets?") https://t.co/P9dWyoptBm

2017-11-07 at 05:24:34: @chaosprime @suchaone @VesselOfSpirit Probably easiest approach is to find an opensource chat project, and just mod user-identity so it's url/hash-based rather than login-based.

2017-11-07 at 05:22:25: @suchaone @chaosprime @VesselOfSpirit Probably simpler would be to make it an open-source app that you can just run locally and then use websockets. Easy to pkg nodejs as exe etc

2017-11-07 at 05:21:21: @suchaone @chaosprime @VesselOfSpirit I've thought of creating something like this. Offline multi-tab comms is hard but *is* possible (https://t.co/frasUvQWgw).

2017-11-07 at 05:10:45: @BenMosior @ryan_nayr_ @fortelabs Also could I get a retweet of the idea &amp; poll from you? I want to get more responses.

2017-11-07 at 05:10:06: @BenMosior @ryan_nayr_ @fortelabs Amen to that!

...but I guess I also mean that it might be on net *worse* than the more API-based way.

2017-11-07 at 04:51:28: @BenMosior @ryan_nayr_ @fortelabs *sigh* so true. Could also do it without even using twitter API, maybe? Just by embedding tweets? Nonoptimal though probably

2017-11-07 at 02:53:05: @ryan_nayr_ @fortelabs But yeah, if multiple people used it, then it could create for even more effective twitter conversations.

2017-11-07 at 02:52:45: @ryan_nayr_ @fortelabs Well the idea is that you could use it even if other people aren't. Like I could be using it right now to reply to you, for example.

2017-10-05 at 03:31:09: @fortelabs @alexbaldwin 5/ Obviously you want "knowledge work(er)" there somewhere. Can you be more specific about which KWs you're targeting? It's a big category!

2017-10-05 at 03:25:45: @fortelabs @alexbaldwin 1/ Something more concrete might be sthg like "Taylorism was a philosophy of work that revolutionized physical labor. But now it's outdated.

2017-10-05 at 03:24:11: @fortelabs @alexbaldwin Opening line feels accurate but bland &amp; abstract. That's a very large category, even if others in it brand differently. What's your flavor?

2017-10-05 at 03:12:26: @sehurlburt I would be into that if it still had haptic feedback somehow (and not just vibration, which incidentally is *not* silent)

2017-10-05 at 03:09:48: @fortelabs @garybasin Also cool, b/c connected with the concept of grief: a grievance is essentially a grief that wasn't digested and has fermented and festered.

2017-07-06 at 03:39:45: @vgr @visakanv (After some work) One thing that's working is staying focused on really feeling my desire for the ultimate essay; whetting appetite to write

2017-07-06 at 02:48:28: @vgr @visakanv Yeah, that's the plan now 😉 This demon just needed exorcising first.🐙

2017-07-06 at 02:46:43: @vgr @visakanv 15/ ofc usually your problem isn't literally part of plan. but it seems a problem-unproblemifying mindset still outperfs a problemifying one

2017-07-06 at 02:43:13: @vgr @visakanv 14/ Seems main thing is to focus on: "you have an editor because it was *part of the plan* for the essay to not be perfect yet"

2017-07-06 at 02:42:27: @vgr @visakanv 13/ Anyway, pragmatically speaking, what cognitive shift do I need to do in order to be able to effectively edit my essay?

2017-07-06 at 02:41:45: @vgr 12/ @visakanv has written about how the shame response gets in the way of actually seeing the situation clearly:
https://t.co/UjO7dBKCNP

2017-07-06 at 02:40:43: @vgr 11/ So this stuck kind of problem isn't a problem-to-solve. It's a problem-to-feel-bad about. Hence shame response.

2017-07-06 at 02:37:25: @vgr 10/ I think the problem {thing} involves some sort of fixation on the past. Problemy problem is not fixable because it's too late somehow.

2017-07-06 at 02:36:26: @vgr 9/ but not just "problem"→"problem I shouldnt have" ie "problem that is a problem" Again circular. Not surprising for a kind of insanity tho

2017-07-06 at 02:33:09: @vgr 8/ ie the self-judging part of me seems to think that the correct world state is for my essay to already be perfect, and otherwise = problem

2017-07-06 at 02:31:25: @vgr 7/ There's a quote in Passionate Marriage: "Why do you think you shouldn't be having the problems that you're having?" That feels relevant.

2017-07-06 at 02:30:01: @vgr 6/ Another model is like... that parts of me think negative feedback is being said for the purpose of making me feel bad? Feels circular...

2017-07-06 at 02:28:44: @vgr 5/ Could be an identity thing, about how much I'm identified with the post? →solution = keep my identity small? I think it's something else.

2017-07-06 at 02:27:20: @vgr 4/ These self-judgmental thoughts are clearly failing to parse useful meaning from the comments. They're a sort of fearful flinch response.

2017-07-06 at 02:24:09: @vgr 3/ the valence of the feedback is swinging my mood/perceptions of the post way more than is reasonable: "I'm a genius" ↔ "I'm a fool"

Super simple: just sitting still until I feel excited to work

2017-07-03 at 15:45:24: @jonnysweetfeet They later removed it in favor of something prettier, but the same tech that shows off complex syntax detection ALSO reduces cog load

2017-07-03 at 15:21:47: @fortelabs @byudkowsky 6/ What I'm digging about @fortelabs' approach is that he's building mood-consciousness into the work itself, so it's intrinsic.

2017-07-03 at 15:19:00: @fortelabs 5/ Another: create names for your moods and try method-acting them. Inspired by @byudkowsky, here's mine: https://t.co/yDFQ2fKuY8

2017-07-02 at 16:07:05: @visakanv @fortelabs Yeah I sometimes get a huge burst of energy, prompting handstands or dancing, when I solve a satisfying technical problem. cf "happy dance"

2017-07-02 at 16:00:18: Be the world you wish to change

2017-07-02 at 14:04:42: @fortelabs @visakanv So a drop releases any tension/question I might have of whether now's the moment to move energetically. Like with:  https://t.co/KNAZWZzWsO

2017-07-02 at 14:00:53: @fortelabs @visakanv Music: dancing energetically w/o a beat feels awkward, ∴ hard to get energy to do it. But w/ a beat, I'd feel uncomfortable if *not* dancing

2017-07-02 at 13:58:22: @fortelabs @visakanv But holding that energy in internally can still mean it's getting burned; just cancelled out by some other part. See
https://t.co/IdXloJpliT

2017-07-02 at 13:56:36: @fortelabs @visakanv Regarding the "is it free?" Q: I suspect often the energy is in a sense released from an internal hold (related to "music → tension" idea)

2017-07-02 at 13:54:43: @fortelabs @visakanv Ultimately glucose or some other chemical fuel is getting burned, but not much more than your basal metabolic rate necessarily.

2014-10-25 at 17:24:24: @madebyloren No, but the link I sent my friends had just the boilerplate text, which was silly.

2014-10-25 at 17:23:53: @madebyloren and then also about 5 minutes to make it so if you haven't saved and you try to close the tab then you get "wait are you sure?"

2014-06-09 at 07:55:30: @Twinklecrepe @VanguardVivian Sounds small but I think its a big part of the appeal—it feels like it actually depicts youth culture this way

2014-06-09 at 07:53:38: @Twinklecrepe @VanguardVivian All else aside, both the book and the movie do an unparalleled job of accurately incorporating eg texting.

2012-01-26 at 15:14:04: @DFence Hmm... Can you look in sdcard/FileKicker/ to see if the files actually did download? Try using another file browser like ASTRO

2012-01-25 at 23:48:09: @DFence Hmmm... weird. Have you tried sending other file types? When do you get this error? When trying to open? I'll have a look later!
