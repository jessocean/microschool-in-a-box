- Agape: ~unconditional / holy love
- Eros: romantic / sexual love
- Philia: affection / friendship
- Storge: familial love

(Hmm, I thought there were a couple more?)

2019-05-30 at 23:37:16: @dthorson Also, consider that "love" in English is trying to stuff a bunch of different concepts into one linguistic basket.

It's split up differently in other languages, for example Greek

2019-05-09 at 20:17:46: @Malcolm_Ocean @kevinakwok @KevinSimler @backus @nayafia @JoHenrich I can draw faces decently well when looking at people or photos, but from memory it winds up as minimalist cartoons with accurate hair length / glasses / etc, but not very recognizable.

2019-05-09 at 20:14:39: @Malcolm_Ocean @kevinakwok @KevinSimler @backus @nayafia @JoHenrich I read *very* fast - learning about that tradeoff was an "aha!" moment. 

I'm certainly not as faceblind as Oliver Sacks was. Seems I have a right hemisphere gestalt, and some fragments of left hemisphere specific focus, but LH can't quite synthesize the parts into a whole?

2019-05-09 at 20:09:18: @Malcolm_Ocean @kevinakwok @KevinSimler @backus @nayafia @JoHenrich Here are some excerpts from The Secret of Our Success, on reading &amp; facial recognition: https://t.co/KIhRG8Hj4A

2019-05-09 at 20:08:23: @Malcolm_Ocean @kevinakwok @KevinSimler @backus @nayafia I read something in @JoHenrich 's The Secret of Our Success that might shed some light on what's up. 

Learning to read competes with facial recognition, for space in the fusiform gyrus. Pushes face recognition out of the left side, and into the right hemisphere as best it can

2019-05-09 at 20:04:47: @Malcolm_Ocean @kevinakwok @KevinSimler @backus @nayafia Awww hi! ‚ô•Ô∏è

About tactile mapping... I think it's not just about the sensory modality.

For familiar faces, I do have a gestalt sense of each individual face as a whole. It's visual / emotional, and probably other senses if I have that experience.

2019-05-09 at 14:33:15: @Malcolm_Ocean @kevinakwok @KevinSimler @backus @nayafia Faces, though! They resist both vector and raster recall. I remember parts of faces but can't get them to cohere into an entire accurate picture in memory.

...Probably moderately faceblind.

2019-05-09 at 14:23:47: @Malcolm_Ocean @kevinakwok @KevinSimler @backus @nayafia Although - hmm, I can do the wireframe too - just from a different prompt than "what does it look like from outside".

Uhh... I think it still usually has color but it's like vector art. Oh! Yeah, your prompt led to a raster, no wonder.

2: As a vector that points at a competing desire, under which is some universal human need )

2019-04-24 at 17:21:46: @reasonisfun @pnw_anglo @cosimia_ @JayTSack I agree that peer group emotional &amp; opinion tracking is straightforwardly valuable. 

I'm claiming that clickbait is a parasitic meme piggybacking on that otherwise adaptive system.

(Like -- blood carries nutrients; mosquitos feed on blood)

2019-04-24 at 17:17:52: (the 'recursive trap' being -- trying not to generate clickbait in the process of deconstructing it and investigating remedies to it!)

(Haha -- to try &amp; avoid recursive trap: 
evolutionary and memetic perspectives, 
toxoplasma of rage, 
ad revenue as internet's "original sin", 
deep emotional work as individual agency in navigating "procrastination") https://t.co/rL43aZn94q

2019-04-24 at 17:13:29: @pnw_anglo @reasonisfun @cosimia_ @JayTSack An example from @QiaochuYuan of working through layers of emotions and needs and assumptions, underneath a surface-level "procrastination":

https://t.co/Rp8xccqojO

2019-04-24 at 17:10:58: @pnw_anglo @reasonisfun @cosimia_ @JayTSack And, of course, there is a lot that individuals can do to work with their personal relation to using time and attention in ways that don't feel aligned with deep purpose! 

Recognizing when it happens is a key first step. Also feeling into why it's happening.

2019-04-24 at 17:09:42: @pnw_anglo @reasonisfun @cosimia_ @JayTSack I don't know how to replace it. Folks are trying various things, with micropayment and subscription systems.

But I do think this is the level on which we need to be thinking about problems with clickbait and attention parasites, if we're looking at culture-scale interventions.

2019-04-24 at 17:07:30: @pnw_anglo @reasonisfun @cosimia_ @JayTSack I think that many forms of "regulation" would be a confused response to this, if they tried to treat the surface without addressing the core.

2019-04-24 at 16:56:52: @pnw_anglo @reasonisfun @cosimia_ @JayTSack To the extent that clickbait ties into that system, it makes sense that it would spread. 

And, yes, parasitically in the sense that it's not good for us in its current form.

One model of that form is the "toxoplasma of rage":

https://t.co/btxkbYTFwI

2019-04-24 at 16:54:27: @pnw_anglo @reasonisfun @cosimia_ @JayTSack Perhaps not "distractibility"?

Instead, consider the very adaptive trait of, "What are my peers thinking and feeling right now?"

It also applies to leaving space for not-knowing along meaning-making dimensions, and that gets super weirder and more potentially fraught to work with. (Needs a solid group context!)

2019-04-24 at 13:25:53: @jonnym1ller @Malcolm_Ocean If taken w/o a context for making sense of experiences &amp; re-integrating with daily life, practice, and meaning --psychedelics can certainly sometimes lead folks towards unfounded beliefs. 

Random reinforcement, like Skinner's 'superstitious' pigeons:

2019-04-23 at 23:45:49: @webdevMason @KevinSimler In later life, these "calluses" reduce sensitivity to listening, even in situations where the person might actually deeply want and need to take in what's being said.  

The "tuning out" path is worn deep, and easy to fall into.

2019-04-23 at 23:45:35: @webdevMason @KevinSimler I've described one aspect of this as "calluses against listening." 

Kids are forced to sit quietly and stare forward, regardless of whether or not they are interested or understanding what's being said. Repeat for years, and "calluses" develop.

2019-04-23 at 04:44:14: @QiaochuYuan More and more people start showing up with the same symptoms (and others). 

At some point, surely it becomes clear that it's a systemic issue, rather than a bunch of people with personal problems?

2019-04-22 at 21:40:53: @s_r_constantin @reasonisfun @Meaningness And I bet there's some layer of, 'I find it really hard to think about what it would mean if I enjoyed this thing when I was young, and I'm now standing here telling my kid not to do it."

2019-04-22 at 21:39:28: @s_r_constantin @reasonisfun @Meaningness It's hard to get at that level, because of a lot of unconscious layers of defense. 

People might have patterns of downplaying how fun the thing was when they were kids, or coming up with any number of confabulations / justifications.

2019-04-22 at 21:33:22: @s_r_constantin @reasonisfun @Meaningness Could be because "That's not how we do things" or "It's against the rules" -- but maybe underneath there's:

'I start to feel panicky and queasy about that line of questioning, which might flash to anger in a split second because I don't like feeling panicky.'

2019-04-22 at 21:30:50: @s_r_constantin @reasonisfun @Meaningness So: why would adults forbid kids from doing fun things, like mudpies, wearing sparkle capes to official buildings, or expressing uninhibited vulnerable creativity?

(Or why might peers punish each other for similar things?)

2019-04-22 at 21:22:37: @s_r_constantin @reasonisfun The discomfort = fear of destabilizing personal identity, and also your fundamental meaning-making structures - how you make sense of the world &amp; yourself. 

Destabilizing that can often produce existential panic, nihilism. 

(See what @meaningness has written, for example)

2019-04-22 at 21:21:32: @s_r_constantin @reasonisfun For punishment, it's like a game of generational hot potato -- very hard to be the one to do the self-reflection, face the (sometimes extreme) discomfort of cognitive dissonance, and say... "Wait, why *did* I do that? Is that what I actually want to do?"

2019-04-22 at 21:20:25: @s_r_constantin @reasonisfun One interpretation:

A: Why the hell did I do that? Uhh... must've been that it *was* actually exciting, bc I'm not the kind of person who likes boring things!

B: Why? For the money, duh. 

(This was 1959, so $20 adjusted for inflation is ~$175)

2019-04-22 at 21:17:38: @s_r_constantin @reasonisfun So this experiment -- people did a super long boring task, &amp; were then asked to pitch it as exciting to new "participants":

Group A got $1; group B got $20. 

Afterwards, A rated task way more exciting than B did.

Why?

2019-04-22 at 21:16:55: @s_r_constantin @reasonisfun Oh dang... what if it's aversion to cognitive dissonance on a personal level, coupled with larger forces driving static memeplexes on a cultural level?

2019-04-21 at 14:02:55: @xuenay @_awbery_ @SupernormalMind @drossbucket The fact that tasks disappear when completed seems a total afterthought, a minor mechanic to avoid cluttering your space.

The aesthetics slope towards more action, rather than more stillness.

2019-04-21 at 14:01:02: @xuenay @_awbery_ @SupernormalMind @drossbucket Habitica, on the other hand, is a whole pageantry! Equip your avatar, get points for checking things off, fight monsters with friends! Turns your to-do list into an role-playing game. https://t.co/DrwC4e4VhD

2019-04-21 at 14:00:04: @xuenay @_awbery_ @SupernormalMind @drossbucket After meeting Malcolm, I now store notes there, and feel a tiny bit of aesthetic "guilt" / dissonance! 

But it's a very fine tool for notes. It's just that there's this baked-in landscape that slopes towards emptiness.

2019-04-21 at 13:59:13: @xuenay @_awbery_ @SupernormalMind @drossbucket Workflowy has a very minimalist white &amp; black interface, and tasks disappear when completed. 

When I started using it, I had a vague sense of... wouldn't it be nicer if I completed everything and got it back to that clean slate? Isn't it a bit messy to add a new thing?

2019-04-21 at 13:58:41: @xuenay @_awbery_ @SupernormalMind @drossbucket Metaphor #2: Workflowy &amp; Habitica. 

They're both ways of collecting &amp; completing tasks. And they have many differences in design (both obvious &amp; subtle, fundamental &amp; superficial).

These shape the landscape of which interactions seem more easy / natural / "downhill."

2019-04-21 at 13:39:25: @xuenay @_awbery_ @SupernormalMind @drossbucket Maybe then Tantra is more like... you're grabbing the handle of the knife, and while you can sharpen it on a whetstone, cut up a watermelon, gut a fish (etc), you're not going to lose track of the blade and accidentally file it down to nothing. 

Although, you might cut yourself!

2019-04-21 at 13:37:51: @xuenay @_awbery_ @SupernormalMind @drossbucket With a rounded handle, you can't lay it flat and move the knife across; you have to hold the file and move it. 

When filing real knives, people advise caution, because there's a tendency to remove too much: https://t.co/nvC1NFE70o

2019-04-21 at 13:36:50: @xuenay @_awbery_ @SupernormalMind @drossbucket The new Consensus Buddhism packaging just says, "Great for sharpening!" The shape of the handle is unchanged.

If you want to sharpen the knife of your awareness, you can use a file for that. But the handle shapes the way you use it. 
https://t.co/BIoKYYrCnN

2019-04-21 at 13:36:12: @xuenay @_awbery_ @SupernormalMind @drossbucket I'm going to see if a metaphor helps here. I can think of 2. 

1: I'm imagining Sutric meditation practices as like a file or rasp. It's a tool for removing. The traditional framework says its purpose is to remove everything.

2019-04-21 at 13:13:34: @xuenay @_awbery_ @SupernormalMind @drossbucket (Cognitive coupling is my native language, and I have... proficiency in decoupling, but it's broken down a few times in classes on organic chem, physics, parts of calculus, programming. I can often intuit the shapes, but get frustrated with the notation &amp; teaching style.)

2019-04-21 at 13:03:45: @xuenay @_awbery_ @SupernormalMind @drossbucket Another interpretation could be: no matter how much you lean towards decoupling, the nature of contemplative practice will take you places where context matters, so at some point it won't be possible to fully separate tool from context &amp; framework.

2019-04-21 at 13:00:34: @xuenay @_awbery_ @SupernormalMind @drossbucket And, it could apply in different ways. 

One way could be: individuals fall on a spectrum of strong cognitive coupling &lt;--&gt; strong cognitive decoupling. The farther towards coupling you are, the more the context &amp; framework of the practice are inseparable from the tools.

2019-04-21 at 12:57:03: @xuenay @_awbery_ @SupernormalMind Hmm... reading this discussion, I'm reminded of @drossbucket 's post on cognitive decoupling. I'm wondering, is that concept useful in pointing at a difference in assumptions or experience y'all might be having?

2019-04-19 at 19:14:16: @Meaningness @Malcolm_Ocean @_awbery_ The shape in my head is something like... 

Sutra: Every time you get to a dharma gate, go through it. They're boundless. (Etc) 

Dzogchen: Just look at the thing! The sum of the infinite series converges to Buddhahood. Feel that click into place, and then go do stuff with it!

?

2019-04-19 at 19:10:39: @Meaningness @Malcolm_Ocean @_awbery_ Hmm... just thought of that metaphor, and it may not hold up.

In calculus, my eyes always glazed over when they got to series. So, this feels very fuzzy. 

I'm thinking of this version of the vows (image): https://t.co/sPsFgfoBOt

2019-04-19 at 18:58:01: @Meaningness @Malcolm_Ocean @_awbery_ Also, I have no idea how y'all think of Alan Watts! 

I feel very fortunate to have downloaded like 3 gigs of his stuff in 2010 - provided an extremely useful memetic vaccine against nihilism &amp; more virulent philosophies. 

But maybe he leans monist / eternalist / muddled?

2019-04-19 at 18:55:36: @Meaningness @Malcolm_Ocean @_awbery_ I guess I've maybe thought of the vows as like the parts of calculus where the dang sigmas come in, and sometimes it's a complicated-looking thing that adds up to 1. So you could go iterate stepwise through it, or get how it comes out?

2019-04-19 at 18:52:55: @Meaningness @Malcolm_Ocean @_awbery_ Huh! Ok, so... is that why Bodhisattva "vows" don't quite make sense in tantra?

Because instead of saying, "I vow to keep trying for the impossible" it's like... get on with it?

(I'm reminded of Alan Watts saying, "Oh, come off it, Shiva!")

2019-04-19 at 17:34:23: @_Piperfog @KarliePonett An interesting thing here - are difference &amp; hierarchy always "bad", or is there a place for voluntary, temporary, project-based hierarchy in a collaborative framework?

Ex: Jane knows how to build a barn. Ed wants a barn. Jane leads neighborhood barn-raising.

2019-04-19 at 17:28:44: @_jordan_bates Reminds me of Leonard Cohen's song Anthem:

"Ring the bells (ring the bells) that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack in everything (there is a crack in everything)
That's how the light gets in"

2019-04-19 at 16:53:01: @_Piperfog @KarliePonett And, it's usually not just one choice, but over and over until it sticks.

I do think there's a role for learning, teaching, growing together. And learning is not a thing you can "do to" another person. 

Very counterproductive to try &amp; force through internal resistance.

2019-04-19 at 16:48:51: @_Piperfog @KarliePonett One way I've made sense of my experience, is that there's an internal choice towards... accepting what is so, as a starting point for healing. 
The opposite of denial, reflexively flinching away from pain.

And nobody can make that choice for another person. Not possible.

2019-04-19 at 16:09:45: Ah dangit, I probably *do* need to write up a blog post on this. Seems like I can't not do it.

2019-04-19 at 16:09:44: And my framework doesn't negate respect and caution! 
Holy crap, be careful with these things!

This is tinkering with the foundations of your own goddamn mental &amp; cultural software: concepts of identity, motivational drives, sense of meaning, etc..

2019-04-19 at 16:09:44: Memeplexes reproduce themselves like genes, but much faster in our current cultural environment. 

Some are more or less friendly to human wellbeing and what we care about. Some are parasitic, others symbiotic, or inspirational.
Some are huge &amp; cultural, others small &amp; personal.

2019-04-19 at 16:09:44: My take also provides a way to understand observed ~agency of psychedelic entities. 

"What does ayahuasca want?"
Same type of question as, "What does capitalism want?"
Or Buddhism, Santa Claus, etc.

All can be understood to cause tangible material change via human action.

2019-04-19 at 16:09:43: Hrmm... this seems slightly less confused than some accounts, but still confused! 

My take: "Ayahuasca spirits" as hyperobjects, distributed computing memeplexes - doesn't require dualism, doesn't negate profundity &amp; utility of experiences. https://t.co/EaHWZRiuGC

2019-04-19 at 15:41:16: @KarliePonett @_Piperfog The book Conscious Loving has models of what people can do instead of victimhood, towards integration and growth:

https://t.co/1M1Yv7CWDz

2019-04-19 at 15:40:48: @KarliePonett @_Piperfog And, hmm... I think that "victimhood" as a concept is broken. 

Our culture has set it up so that only victims deserve support. ("Deserve" is also broken!) 

But this creates a scarcity of caring, and can cut people off from their own power and agency to learn and grow.

2019-04-19 at 15:28:49: @KarliePonett @_Piperfog (This is one of David Chapman's sites, btw)

2019-04-19 at 15:20:46: @KarliePonett @_Piperfog Huh, this sounds like a very different understanding of "darkness" and "victimhood", than what I use. 

I've been reading a lot about Buddhist Tantra lately. They model darkness/horror as an inescapable fact of life, &amp; powerful tool when integrated:

2019-04-19 at 03:06:17: @JMartinMcFly Hey @Malcolm_Ocean - sounds like some of the functions you've been wanting?

2019-04-19 at 02:25:06: @BenGoldhaber @QiaochuYuan I think there are a lot that care about *their* humans, but... so far, it's very hard to scale that caring up to *all* humans (and the ecological etc systems of which we are a part). 

So a lot of that loving in-group care becomes hateful or indifferent out-group externality

2019-04-19 at 02:21:32: @spearofsolomon @QiaochuYuan Yup. Reminds me of this article:

2019-04-19 at 01:56:32: @_awbery_ @Meaningness I've also been unsure how to talk about bodhisattva motivation / vows. 

I feel clear in myself about it, as best I can, and unclear about cultural contexts and vocabulary. 

Especially because different traditions have different practices.

2019-04-19 at 01:51:03: @_awbery_ @Meaningness Feels... solid, to hear all this. I hadn't really realized how confusing it's been, to try and "do" cobbled-together Buddhism fragments. 

(And glad I didn't try to commit to a formal Sutra path!)

2019-04-19 at 01:03:28: @Meaningness @Malcolm_Ocean Ahahaha oh nooo! I got increasingly distressed at how polyphyletic, multisyllabic, and confusing Buddhist classification schemes are -- and then started laughing, because I'd just written a whole long thing about how you can't escape distressing things! Well played all around

2019-04-19 at 00:55:05: @Auptimist Interesting! 

"Be their own gods" as in... a secular "mammothist" (compare to "humanist") orientation?

Or a more shamanic / tantric kind of culture -- do rituals to embody big avatars temporarily? 

Or something else?

2019-04-18 at 23:53:46: @cosimia_ Oh dang this catalyzed a whole bunch of other threads &amp; discussion. 

Gets into looking at the horror and beauty and responsibility from a sort of Buddhist Tantra perspective:

2019-04-18 at 23:50:11: And you can still make choices that matter, to care for what you care about.

2019-04-18 at 23:50:11: Contaminated and pure, sacred and profane start to break down, and build back up into something different.

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a ‚Äúright‚Äù or ‚Äúwrong‚Äù way to feel about these, before or after you know more about them. Many layers of meaning and story. It‚Äôs patterned and nebulous.

Some of the key patterns that make you who you are, biologically, are made of ancient viruses. We wouldn‚Äôt be able to carry our babies in the womb, if it weren‚Äôt for viral DNA.

2019-04-18 at 23:40:25: And, the retrovirus. What comes up for you?

As humans, we're not on Team Virus, right? Viruses are terrifying, and sometimes deadly! https://t.co/OdjJHTQDfr

2019-04-18 at 23:35:11: And! Humans have worshipped scarabs, dung beetles. 

Without them, we‚Äôd be knee-deep in dung! 
Important for nutrient cycling.
https://t.co/tiULh5908f

2019-04-18 at 23:35:11: Dung beetle poets: 

"Shit, triumphant prize of victors! Shit, nourishing cradle for babies! 

The ox anus, glorious fountain from which all good things flow!"

2019-04-18 at 23:35:11: Consider that different species would have different valences (attraction / aversion) to the same stimuli. 

If dung beetles wrote poetry, they would compose odes to the sweet fragrance of life-giving shit.

2019-04-18 at 23:35:10: It‚Äôs also a dung beetle! Does that change how you feel?

(Phanaeus vindex - I‚Äôve seen ‚Äòem in Florida!) https://t.co/o0WF6w9Yo8

2019-04-18 at 23:35:10: And the beetle! I find it beautiful!

How about you? https://t.co/5O1UuAIDn3

Cock et al. 2012 - PDF via Google Scholar, search doi 10.1079/PAVSNNR20127043 ) https://t.co/EtYfnhQEQa

2019-04-18 at 23:29:54: And yet. Without parasitoid wasps, and other diseases and predators that kill plant-eating insects, our own vital crops would fail. 

If baculoviruses did not liquefy caterpillars, human children would starve.

2019-04-18 at 23:29:53: (Darwin felt the horror: "I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created parasitic wasps with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of Caterpillars.")

2019-04-18 at 23:29:53: As a child, I felt the horror, and would try to remove the cocoons, not knowing it was already doomed.

2019-04-18 at 23:29:53: Or, perhaps, you find a caterpillar, covered in cocoons of parasitoid wasps. The larvae have eaten it from the inside out, and emerged through its skin. It will die soon. 

What does that bring up? https://t.co/6hmaYoSx0w

2019-04-18 at 23:25:47: Now you find out it is Striga, witchweed, a parasitic plant that sucks nutrients from cereal crops. It destroys the equivalent of 15 million meals per day in Africa.

2019-04-18 at 23:21:52: Now, I want to pull in a few examples from biology &amp; ecology, to point at how all this goes way deeper than any modern Moloch.

(Perhaps a bit of bending some assumption back and forth until it snaps?)

2019-04-18 at 23:21:52: And there‚Äôs something here about‚Ä¶ ‚Äúhorror that paralyzes‚Äù (like Lovecraftian nihilism) vs ‚Äúhorror that galvanizes‚Äù (like Feynman at the Oak Ridge plant, telling folks to store those nuclear materials further apart!)

2019-04-18 at 23:21:52: Or, folks could add ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs hopeless‚Äù to #3 and fall into a trap of:

4B: Moloch is Evil and no other things are Good. 

There‚Äôs nihilism for you:
https://t.co/V7H1taFUd7

2019-04-18 at 23:21:52: (This, I think, is why Scott Alexander‚Äôs post about ‚ÄúThe Goddess of Everything Else‚Äù didn‚Äôt quite land for me? Because it‚Äôs about getting entirely free of the Darwinian charnel ground, and I think that‚Äôs a confusion.)

2019-04-18 at 23:21:51: Now, here‚Äôs where things could get confused, if folks went on to:

4A: Moloch is Evil and some other things are Good; Moloch is entirely contaminated and some other things are pure. 

There‚Äôs dualism for you! And a whole bunch of stuff around attachment and aversion.

2019-04-18 at 23:21:51: If someone‚Äôs very reactive, getting some space between the gut reaction, and the meaning of it, and the choice of action, can help. 

If someone‚Äôs very numb, getting more connection with the gut reaction, and the meaning of it, and the choice of action, can help.

2019-04-18 at 23:21:51: And we‚Äôve had cultures clash and break down such that an action can mean ‚Äúloving care‚Äù in one framework and ‚Äúhorror like unto misplaced bodily fluids‚Äù in another. Crazy-making!

2019-04-18 at 23:21:51: And also, the value of a signal is dependent on its context. 
We‚Äôre now in a situation where there is no ‚Äúaway.‚Äù Reflexive flinching is no longer enough.

2019-04-18 at 23:21:50: Flinching from horror has been adaptive for human survival! 

Flinch away from misplaced blood and shit ‚Üí get fewer infections ‚Üí have more surviving babies. 

I figure, treat it as a signal, as you would pain - "alert! this situation is not friendly to human survival"

2019-04-18 at 23:21:50: Some things that make decent sense to me:

1. Molochian patterns freak me the fuck out, man! I am frightened, I am horrified. 
2. Molochian patterns could kill me, and could destroy human civilization as we know it.
3. I want to live and thrive, and I want the same for humanity.

2019-04-18 at 23:21:50: I think there are at least a few different components of how someone could react to ‚ÄúChildren of Moloch‚Äù memeplexes, and folks could get tangled up between them. 

(I may bungle this and would be glad of any help; words remain broken as usual)

2019-04-18 at 23:21:50: I also find myself wanting to point at some of @algekalipso ‚Äòs stuff:
https://t.co/4gHPe0EFyV

I don‚Äôt always agree with his conclusions, and I find his work fascinating. There‚Äôs usually a chunk of math and physics leading up to the conclusion that I haven‚Äôt yet managed to grok.

2019-04-18 at 23:21:49: And I think that Tantra perspective is an important base for any practice that involves looking at horror. 

(Vinay Gupta talks about this in his recent conversations with Daniel Thorson, which is a Whole ‚ÄòNother Thread)

2019-04-18 at 23:12:12: And as a pure land:
https://t.co/7YWbSrxMQK

2019-04-18 at 23:12:12: So, horror: not just modern, not just egregores!

2019-04-18 at 23:12:11: I've been thinking a lot about this today, and now it's gotten all mixed up with a bunch of reading I was doing about Vajrayana and Tantra. 

I guess that's pretty appropriate!

2019-04-18 at 22:55:24: @QiaochuYuan Oh man. I've been thinking a lot about this today, and now it's gotten all mixed up with a bunch of reading I was doing about Vajrayana and Tantra, and I guess that's pretty appropriate! I've got a whole bunch of stuff written, trying to decide whether to post it as tweets...

2019-04-18 at 19:34:31: Buddhist ideas have been pretty core to how I understand myself and the world, and also I've had no formal nothin'. 

How do Vajrayana / Tantra teachings interact with the Bodhisattva vows, for instance?

2019-04-18 at 19:34:31: Oh man, what a fantastic muddle! I seem to be solidly inclined towards the Tantra side of this? 

Certainly the cessation of sensation, focus on no-self as goal, renunciate practice, and the arhat path haven't appealed to me.

2019-04-18 at 05:42:59: @alifeofmovement The field of international negotiation has some useful resources, like Adam Kahane's book "Collaborating with the Enemy: How to Work with People You Don‚Äôt Agree with or Like or Trust":

https://t.co/COp62l0CZn

2019-04-18 at 05:30:47: He described a scene of beautiful deity figures as scarecrow puppets in a garden. 

"He wanted to make the children understand that all gods are homemade, and that it's we who pull their strings and so give them the power to pull ours." https://t.co/kBQywgPDbC

2019-04-18 at 05:30:47: Not that dissimilar to how we often center agency in corporations, when we tell stories. "Facebook" did this, "Google" did that. 

And, as Aldous Huxley wrote in Island, all gods are homemade.
https://t.co/SDpv1JwaOV

2019-04-18 at 05:30:47: The art cars move like vast neon whale gods, trailed by schools of worshippers. They interact, have allegiances and rivalries. 

And can be understood as centers of narrative agency. 
("Why all the effort, time, $?" "For the god.")

https://t.co/9W7ctmFg5b

2019-04-18 at 05:30:46: Ex: The scale of the most massive art cars at Burning Man is awe-inspiring, in the old meaning: " reverential respect mixed with fear or wonder"

Especially Mayan Warrior, Sanctuary, etc. 
"And the people bowed and prayed, to the neon god they made."

https://t.co/GuCKElkVbl

2019-04-18 at 05:30:46: Humans love to paint huge patterns with archetypal meaning, as a way to understand and interact. 

Patterns of creation, chaos, time, life, death, elements, nature, fertility, hunting, harvest, love, war... 

And we're making new concentrations of meaning and power. Gods?

2019-04-18 at 04:59:12: An odd stance: quasi-gods as Timothy Morton's "hyperobjects". 

Agency could be understood as outputs of enormous churning memetic systems; individual human actions just nodes in vast sweeping computations.

"Moloch" is an example:
https://t.co/bll6iIemQh

2019-04-18 at 04:59:12: No scattered thread of thoughts about gods &amp; responsibility would be complete w/o mentioning AI! 

Charles Stross, in fiction, describes "weakly godlike AI" - bound by physics, no miracles, but vastly exceeding human capacities. This essay gives a scale:

https://t.co/YQfQ4d7r4i

2019-04-18 at 04:47:57: Another stance: humanity as a sleepwalking god. Terrifying

Ecologist Paul Hirsch has described humanity as a "myopic giant" whose reach vastly exceeds its vision. 

Points at new modes of distributed sense-making that are needed to "think like a planet":

https://t.co/VdhLBPX6n7

2019-04-18 at 04:36:54: Second one is more about agency, sovereignty, choice. 

Power to control vast forces that were once considered the sole domain of the gods.

There's a stance in here that says, "We aren't gods. Not yet. We're still monkeys."

https://t.co/ZYRrXDfphf

2019-04-18 at 04:31:49: Another is to distinguish between ~ "godhood in origin" and "godhood in potential". 

The first one points somewhere around identifying with a ground of all being. 

(p.s. please note that words are hopelessly broken)

Alan Watts gives a flavor of it:

2019-04-16 at 17:04:40: @QiaochuYuan Just saw Nora Bateson's recent essay on consent &amp; complexity, which reminded me of your thread:

https://t.co/KT4gvTj0QC

2019-04-16 at 15:46:57: @algekalipso The PDF points at voluntary hierarchical "mission teams" held within a collaborative heterarchy framework. 

Applying that to internal subagents is a little odd but doable. Resolves authoritarian goodself / badself splits (as described in "The Guru Papers"). 

7/

2019-04-16 at 15:42:45: @algekalipso Does your subagent power distribution model hold that hierarchy always = coercive and a flatter distribution / heterarchy / consensus always = more collaborative?

If so, I recommend p. 7-17 of this PDF:
https://t.co/ddFPiOJ8aI

6/

2019-04-16 at 15:36:46: @algekalipso "Internal Family Systems consilience" does resonate for me, although I've usually heard that word more re: knowledge systems than identity &amp; sense-making &amp; decision-making.
https://t.co/ghxZaH9TYP

Pointing at collaboration / synergetics / deep same-sidedness?

5/

2019-04-16 at 15:33:28: @algekalipso Lost me a bit on the "normal distribution" of subagent causal power in MDMA-like states. Bell curve... some subagents have high power, some have low, most have middling?

Not sure which distribution I'd expect from Perceptual Control Theory, in "healthy" state absent trauma.

4/

2019-04-16 at 15:30:19: @algekalipso "Empathogenic high-valence states" like MDMA? Internal wellspring of safety, love, compassion busts the warzone scarcity mentality?

Heals corrosive effects of PTSD on the ground of deep trust; see this thread for example:
https://t.co/DT3cjo1gkJ

2019-04-16 at 15:24:51: @algekalipso And "Pareto structure" as in 80% of oomph comes from 20% of subagents, roughly approximating power law distribution?
https://t.co/JNijQ5fbVJ

Is that a bit like personality subagent warlords, a fractal feudal power structure? Coercive bc there's no time to sort it out?

2019-04-15 at 03:18:13: @luminousalicorn @liron But, some biofuels are way better than others! Brazilian sugarcane &amp; switchgrass are excellent, up to 7-8 times energy return. And algal biofuels don't compete with terrestrial farmland.

2019-04-15 at 03:14:40: @luminousalicorn @liron Plus, corn ethanol directly competes with using corn for human food (or livestock feed, although that's also energy inefficient). Can drive up food prices globally in times of scarcity.

One of the many issues with trying to scale up biofuels hugely:

https://t.co/0T10ZhODST

2019-04-15 at 03:13:14: @luminousalicorn @liron Yeah! A few points: 

Net energy ratio (NER) or energy return on investment (EROI) is one key factor. 

Corn-derived ethanol is terrible at this! If you put 1 unit of energy into growing corn, you can get 1.3 units out as ethanol, maybe. Boring!

NO! It is a glorious blazer, fit for a mighty Tremoctopus!"

And that's the sort of thing I look for in a jacket. https://t.co/GtfV5367Cd

2019-04-03 at 19:39:51: @Meta_Aesthetic And other approaches don't just combine different approaches, but integrate, like Nora Bateson's "warm data":
https://t.co/B2uebDm74u

2019-04-03 at 19:19:42: @Meta_Aesthetic Like different tools in a toolbelt, or... maybe more like a spectrum of attention. 

Like how you can turn the hose on a narrow stream to blast something clean, and then turn it back to a wide gentle shower to water plants.

2019-04-03 at 19:17:52: @Meta_Aesthetic And, I'd say that humans need both, in our lives as a whole. 

I guess the fluid mode might be to respond to circumstances dynamically, with a rational, focused, critical approach, or free-flowing, emergent, optimistic -- as needed.

2019-04-03 at 19:13:28: @Meta_Aesthetic Many groups need both!

For example: "Action hippies" can be found building infrastructure at Burning Man, Ephemerisle, etc - making spaces for spontaneous, creative play, and also dead serious about material tolerances, fire safety, supply lines, etc.

2019-04-03 at 19:03:04: @Meta_Aesthetic And the key is -- what is the purpose of the group, and is the approach well-aligned with its environment? 
An air traffic accident investigation group, probably makes sense to lean dour. 
A musical improvisation troupe, makes sense to lean a bit manic.

2019-04-03 at 19:00:46: @Meta_Aesthetic Maybe it maps a little bit to predictive processing models of depression &amp; mania?

"All your bets are risky, tread cautiously, hunker down, endure."

"Omg, all your bets are great! Yes! Do more of that, embrace life! Live your truth!"

2019-04-03 at 18:56:50: @Meta_Aesthetic I got fired from an ayahuasca center due to this. Boss fixated on the healing power of belief, and there wasn't room for clear thinking.

They didn't want to dwell on the "negative", and so couldn't adequately prevent or mitigate risks. Inadequate first aid kit, etc.

2019-04-03 at 18:54:06: @Meta_Aesthetic OTOH, "Hippies" often resist constraints, and fear getting caught in systems that deny spontaneity, vibrancy, possibility.  

Even to the point of denying observations of external reality if they're disappointing, or don't make a good story.

2019-04-03 at 18:53:39: @Meta_Aesthetic I dropped out of grad school due to this; lack of emotional support &amp; couldn't bring in a big enough picture to feel meaningful. 

Felt caught in misaligned incentive landscape that narrowed possibilities until they didn't matter.

2019-04-03 at 18:51:58: @Meta_Aesthetic Rational / systematic groups often resist thinking that gets too weird / emotional / meta, threatens the rigid reliability of the system. 

Even to the point of denying experiences of internal subjectivity that don't fit the model of what's expected / what you should be feeling.

2019-04-03 at 18:51:19: @Meta_Aesthetic I've experienced this, definitely! Seems we need both -- vibrant wild unrestrained hypothesis generation, and also careful, considered pruning of those ideas, deciding where to place your bets. 

Many groups seem to fixate on one &amp; deny the other.

2019-04-03 at 16:40:27: Huh! The suggestion of using coal fly ash gave me pause, because I associate it with things like the Kingston TN coal ash disaster in 2008.

https://t.co/WQxSAkwvPm

2019-04-03 at 02:02:32: @TheAnnaGat "Non-naive trust" is also an important conceptual tool. 

Without it, folks get confused &amp; can encourage people to undermine their self-trust (gut + mind, ability to understand, predict, make bets) to uphold a norm or value of "trust" -- when the system isn't actually reliable.

2019-04-03 at 01:25:09: @TheAnnaGat And I think a key part of this is - what model of "trust" are you using? 

When you make bets of interacting with the world, and things don't go as planned, how does that relate to your self-trust?

This podcast takes a deep dive into "what is trust"?

https://t.co/dNDwxT8WGz

2019-03-25 at 19:28:05: Previous me didn't clearly separate out self-fulfilling &amp; self-conflicted experiences, so I would have lumped this awesome mug purchase into a confused category of "indulgences" - to be scrutinized carefully &amp; suspiciously, or doled out sparingly.

But now I have a better model!

2019-03-25 at 19:28:05: It feels great to be connected with the story of the lab that designed &amp; made it, to have an object that catalyzes discussions about pattern formation, and just to hold this awesome-textured science-infused tea vessel!

2019-03-25 at 19:28:05: Which is more about, what comes out of this? Do we want that outcome? Does it make sense? Is it feasible? If not, can it become feasible? 

And, let me tell you, I am enjoying the heck out of this experience!

2019-03-25 at 19:28:05: Oh! Right! The selfie of me with the nervous system cup is an example of the self-fulfilling &amp; self-centered quadrant! 

It would've been hard to "justify" the purchase to myself a year ago. And I do feel like I'm using a different operating system now.

2019-03-25 at 18:47:43: Self-conflicted &amp; selfish: "Ohh god, why did I eat all that ice cream?‚Äù

Self-full &amp; selfless: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no place I‚Äôd rather be than this monastery.‚Äù

Self-full &amp; selfish: [Something like, "Oh my god yes, I am the focus of this moment and it is AMAZING!!!"]

2019-03-25 at 18:45:25: Looking at this, I might substitute "Self-fulfilling". (I seem to be a verb!)
Or self-centered for selfish?

2019-03-25 at 18:31:23: Yes! Rethinking Narcissism has an extremely useful mode, and describes a scale from unhealthy self-denial / "echoism" --&gt; healthy narcissism (pursue your dreams while remaining in caring relationship with others) --&gt; unhealthy narcissism.

https://t.co/zIS2hrm43k https://t.co/iMuCDeNnmE

2019-03-24 at 16:37:15: @DRMacIver @judy2k Makes sense! These kinds of observations can be used to sculpt your incentive / motivation landscape so that actions which support your long-term wellbeing feel "downhill" and become easier to do:

https://t.co/GGJePxKL4J

2019-03-24 at 16:34:29: @DRMacIver @judy2k And it's deeply okay to make those tradeoffs! Social observation of messiness is not an infinitely bad outcome!

In fact, any situation where one outcome seems "infinitely bad" will warp reasoning, and make it very hard to navigate sensibly &amp; compassionately.

2019-03-24 at 16:33:44: @DRMacIver @judy2k I have found that this can still be a little uncomfortable, but no longer leads to panic / distress. 

I've been able to look back at my actions, and accept myself in having made choices to do other things instead of cleaning, and seeing how those choices made sense in context.

2019-03-24 at 16:33:02: @DRMacIver @judy2k I can now reliably use this as a catalyst, while having removed its fangs (the part about, "you will be judged and found unworthy if it's not in an acceptable state"). 

To test this mindset shift: What happens when people come over and the house is not in a state that I enjoy?

2019-03-24 at 16:31:21: @DRMacIver @judy2k But a few years ago, I took a look at this. I noticed that I could reframe this as: "Guests coming over reliably gives me a boost of energy towards making my space a nicer place to live, which I also enjoy."

2019-03-24 at 16:30:47: @DRMacIver @judy2k One stopgap measure I found that has worked reliably, has been a mindset shift around "cleaning before guests arrive." 

I grew up with this as Southern hospitality based on fear and shame: if other people saw that the house was messy, it was wrong and bad and terrible.

It's a more enjoyable space to live when they are fixed, and it's a lot of work but generally satisfying.

Tree bogs also seem interesting, especially for low impact / intermittent uses like campsites &amp; festivals:
https://t.co/bNrtxSQNj2

2019-03-21 at 20:46:38: ^ This distress is also called "pre-success failure." I'd say that, along w/self-judgment, it's a leading cause of "ugh fields" and flinches that interfere with actually making progress towards the goal state.

@Malcolm_Ocean have you written about pre-success failure anywhere?

2019-03-21 at 20:46:38: In the perceptual control theory sense of "error correction" or Robert Fritz's "creative tension", the journey towards the set point or desirable state generally feels good. 

In the fault-finding mode, it probably feels bad and wrong and distressing until it's solved.

2019-03-21 at 20:46:38: The "towards!" vs solely "away!" navigation system also affects how you feel in the midst of bringing something from an undesirable state towards a desirable state.

2019-03-21 at 20:36:35: @reasonisfun, you might find this interesting! 

I recall that y'all have a different approach to the word "problem" - I might define it as being part of a "should" paradigm that I want to transcend, but I think y'all reclaim it in the spirit of joyous exploration?

2019-03-21 at 20:29:44: I definitely grew up with this as part of my "operating system." It's only been in the last few months that I've clearly identified this dynamic. 

Here's a snippet of a conversation from Dec 2018 (from a group where we sometimes record &amp; transcribe our convos for research):

7/ https://t.co/9Gh9wTqy8D

2019-03-21 at 20:29:44: Your guidance system doesn't *want* you to feel lost (in the perceptual control theory sense of "want"). Navigation is its job.

So it will helpfully make up problems so that you have something to steer by!

6/

2019-03-21 at 20:29:43: AND what's even more pernicious -- if you've been taught to navigate only by flinches and prioritize risk prevention / mitigation, then your entire navigational system will be based on finding faults and problems. 

If there is not a problem, you will feel lost.

5/

2019-03-21 at 20:29:43: Another component of this is, what navigation system are you using? If you don't feel "allowed" to want and strive and explore, then you'll navigate by flinches. 

It's like using a compass ("towards!") vs. a random walk that only bounces off of obstacles ("away!").

4/

2019-03-21 at 20:14:11: @algekalipso has also written about some of the pitfalls and potential positive directions in this area. If you want a fairly technical and transhumanist take on stuff like the hedonic treadmill, look for "Wireheading Done Right."

3/

2019-03-21 at 20:14:11: A lot of what folks call "experiential pica" - procrastination or distraction that feels like junk food - is a result of not feeling "permission" to trust what you most deeply want.

2019-01-30 at 06:13:33: 3rd episode: Like a mix of anthropologists and MST3K, narrating a looong ceremony. (And a huge one - so many participants!) 

Interesting to hear how Ross describes his first (I think?) psychedelic experience.

2019-01-25 at 05:05:35: @Meaningness @Meta_Aesthetic Or maybe you're more into asking, "How do we bootstrap the whole damn cultural platform that would even begin to facilitate people asking these deep &amp; necessary questions?"

If so, that's what I'm working on, with others!

2019-01-25 at 05:01:53: @Meaningness @Meta_Aesthetic Maybe that's through the lens of a specific field or purpose like, "Metarationality for education / communication systems / ecology / politics / economics / spirituality / etc." As in, bringing that translation &amp; interconnection to a particular group.

2019-01-25 at 04:57:23: @Meaningness @Meta_Aesthetic I'm thinking that one way to explore would be, "What am I already involved with / familiar with / skilled in / interested in / caring about, and how might that connect with metasystematicity?"

2019-01-24 at 00:17:46: @Malcolm_Ocean Interesting discussion -- see Romeo's comment: "eliminating certain negative emotions seems to temporarily get rid of any motivation structures that were using those negative emotions as a building block.

It won't get folks across the chasm to fluid mode, but it probably sucks less than wallowing deep in the pit!

2019-01-16 at 02:01:21: @Conaw Nate Soares' "Replacing Guilt" series has a lot of useful things to say in this area, especially the post "Don't steer with guilt":

2019-01-16 at 01:56:11: @Conaw Hmm... I agree that specific guilt is more tractable than vague guilt. *And* I think there are more self-aligned ways of working with the gap between how things are and how you might want or imagine them to be in the future.

2019-01-14 at 21:27:09: @tasshinfogleman @dthorson @bonnittaroy I think of this as Star Trek trust!

2019-01-14 at 21:26:14: @tasshinfogleman @dthorson @bonnittaroy They propose that some kinds of unpredictability can promote a deeper level of non-naive trust.

They explore predictable systems as having limited trust, what I call systematic trust. Constrained, contractual -- these systems limit options out of a fear of betrayal / defection. 
6/

2019-01-14 at 21:24:11: @tasshinfogleman Sometimes, you want to be "meta-systematically reliable." You're willing to trade off on predictability at a lower level, to support integrity on a higher level of mission/value/purpose. People involved are able to hear why, and glad you did!
5/

2019-01-14 at 21:22:43: @tasshinfogleman Sometimes, you want to be what I call "systematically reliable." Maybe you want to be on time because it's a context of low trust or low-bandwidth communication, where you're still building the groundwork for people to hear, "This is why I arrived after the agreed-on time."
4/

2019-01-14 at 21:20:04: @tasshinfogleman The answer depends on context, and on -- what are you trying to be highly reliable *at* and why? Coming from the idea of a "Highly Reliable Organization" / HRO -- see Managing the Unexpected book by Karl Weick:

It's pretty dense, and a long series of tweets, so I've made a separate thread:
1/

2018-12-20 at 20:54:17: @Meaningness @reasonisfun @Malcolm_Ocean @reasonisfun, where are you starting from? What does "meta" mean to you, and what do you want to use it for? Are you finding areas where you expect it to mean one thing and it seems to mean something else?

2018-12-20 at 20:52:55: @Meaningness @reasonisfun @Malcolm_Ocean An excellent question! Hofstadter's "I Am a Strange Loop" was probably my first and most solid intro to the concept of "meta" as a thing in itself... Gregory Bateson also uses it in his work a lot, but I'm not sure how / where he introduces the concept...

2018-11-09 at 20:18:41: 3b: Is Compass tracking that psychedelic therapy may disrupt the very markets they're pursuing, or are they more focused on grabbing as much of the pie as possible? 

In contrast, B corps can navigate this with broader public interest in mind.

2018-11-09 at 20:18:41: 3. Quantz article cites multi-billion $ depression market. If psychedelics are "psychiatry's antibiotic" (@DrSessa) -- how does that change the market? 

Short course solution vs. long-term maintenance therapies -- which is more profitable? What's better for patients?

2018-11-09 at 20:18:41: 2. Holy crap: Compass' contracts can block research publications if it would interfere with their commercial &amp; patent interests. Compare MAPS: supports open sci &amp; has "'an anti-patent strategy' to ensure that no company‚Äînot even MAPS‚Äîcould patent therapeutic uses of MDMA".

2018-11-09 at 20:18:40: 1: @MAPS (a nonprofit) has set up a public benefit corporation to run the MDMA therapy clinical trials &amp; to eventually "balance income from the legal sale of MDMA with the social benefits" of research.

4. My favorite - break the anxiety slate! It's worthwhile at any point, on any scale, to notice that the institution of guilt etc gets in the way of solutions.

2018-11-04 at 18:22:06: @KevinSimler Options:
1. Wipe both slates clean every 7 years (jubilee).

2. Wipe the anxiety slate clean every April 30, and still consider the real-world impacts (annual debt forgiveness). Maybe you'd say, "Absent anxiety, this reply is still worth sending" - or maybe it's not!

(cont'd)

2018-11-04 at 18:19:53: @KevinSimler Hmm, if I'm taking it more thoughtfully... I'm wanting to separate out two kinds of email "debt". One involves the real-world impacts of not replying, and the other is about the burden of anxiety, guilt, angst, shame, obligation, etc.

 https://t.co/8gf48sv36e

2018-11-04 at 16:44:33: But let's take a side road onto cellulose degradation, because: weird termite gut symbiote facts!

They don't eat lignin, but termite guts are full of bizarre tiny critters. Many are eukaryotes (have nuclei) but are also sort of... party boats made of many bacteria. (cont'd)

2018-11-04 at 16:44:33: Do bacteria break down lignin? Ehh, sort of. There are some recent papers (search "bacterial lignin degradation" on Google Scholar). But that probably wasn't what caused the end of the Carboniferous. 

(Also, some party poopers cite climate, not fungi: https://t.co/sD5ctiyQPO )

2018-11-04 at 16:44:33: Lignin gives bark &amp; wood their strength. Nothing could eat it in the Carboniferous; that's why dead trees piled up. Eventually, white-rot *fungi* developed enzymes to break it down, and that's where we are today.

But -- tree-eating bacteria?

2018-11-04 at 16:44:33: First stop, Wikipedia: https://t.co/BfAnfvDP4L

So: all plants have structure because of cellulose. Bacteria &amp; fungi definitely degrade it; that's how cows digest grass, etc. But trees - starting in the Carboniferous - developed lignin as well. It's way harder to break down!

2018-11-04 at 16:44:32: The latest @dinosaurcomics has sent me on a science info quest! It's about the Carboniferous period and the question -- do bacteria eat trees? Winds up at protist charioteers!
