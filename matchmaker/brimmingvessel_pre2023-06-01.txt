2023-05-31 at 20:48:45: at least this painful thing that happened to me is catalyzing reaching out to and relying on my friends 🤍

2023-05-31 at 19:25:16: @danielbrottman oh this sounds fun haha

2023-05-31 at 19:17:37: @marshmarigold very much so! my mom had the stellar suggestion of sending her a message laying out how she violated our agreement &amp; took advantage of me - once i have whatever $ she is planning to pay back

2023-05-30 at 23:27:07: ah might have to go to the haight st goodwill today!

2023-05-30 at 22:13:18: returning from memorial day weekend away. what stands between me and being at home is several more stops on the train and then a 20 min walk home luggin my big ol bag. a warm cup of cacao and lying on the floor with my cat sound real nice rn

2023-05-30 at 20:08:29: also they have a wide toe box @danielbrottman !!!

2023-05-30 at 20:08:12: gonna go for a forest hike/run one of these days, can’t wait to see how the terrain feels w the grippy outsole

2023-05-30 at 20:05:30: bought my first pair of fancy zero drop trail running shoes hehe

2023-05-29 at 22:02:52: hi how’s everyone’s weekend been?

2023-05-29 at 01:55:37: this weekend feels like what our life woulda been like if i moved to LA two years ago

2023-05-28 at 04:48:01: wanna make heartfelt but extremely danceable music

2023-05-28 at 01:57:41: @marshmarigold AH i was between the right answer and the wrong answer for starbucks and i shoulda gone w my initial guess

2023-05-27 at 22:46:42: feelin like da luckiest girl in da world getting to see my boyf two weekends in a row

2023-05-27 at 21:48:28: On my way! to LA to see @braidsmusic tonight :D

2023-05-27 at 19:20:23: @yokaihainen :( i’m sorry friend, that’s fucked :(

2023-05-27 at 11:19:31: did it! finished the draft of the thing, scheduled emails to be sent at 8am to the two profs who need it. whew am i delirious but yaaay what a weight off my shoulders

2023-05-27 at 09:29:41: is the spirit of barbara mcclintock here with us now 🧐🌱 https://t.co/huGfoxK7S7

2023-05-27 at 09:27:54: i’ve been writing about single molecule imaging for the past 2-3 hours 🫠😌

2023-05-27 at 09:27:10: don’t get me wrong i still wanna keep doing human/mammalian cell work, but bacteria are wild. the diversity of bacteria boggles the mind, each species a unique manifestation of Life

2023-05-27 at 09:25:18: hope i get to retvrn to bacterial work at some stage, that’s where it all started for me

2023-05-27 at 05:50:21: @veggiebat_ what’s in ~amber/brown bottles??

2023-05-27 at 04:12:41: also maybe time for a re-read of dis https://t.co/GKdDSVRslx

2023-05-27 at 04:09:37: might do a ritual after dinner invoking my science role models 😌🙃

2023-05-27 at 04:07:15: would be cool if i could incorporate to scientist/biology part of my identity too some how

(reminded of @n_of_oneness’s legendary tryptamine (i think) halloween costume…)

2023-05-27 at 04:05:49: going to a regional burn in ~2 weeks, want to put together a fun costume or two! some crochet, otherwise just assembling pieces however the vision requires

so! y’all have any ideas for me? as a starter i think embodying a hindu deity could be v cool…

2023-05-27 at 02:55:30: bf says for him it often feels good to work when one is “not supposed to” so i am going to channel that subversive energy!!! i &lt;3 bein subversive

2023-05-27 at 02:18:46: trying to “romanticize my life” here. i mean, staying in and pondering my niche of biology, pontificating and doing some digging i think could be quite gratifying and also in alignment with my dharma

2023-05-27 at 02:17:05: i am pretty close to convincing myself that staying in this friday night and immersing myself in science &amp; letting my mind have time and spaciousness to do the work i must do… is the right thing to do. esp since i’m jetting off to LA tomorrow afternoon for a fun wknd w bf!

2023-05-27 at 02:11:41: i am asking, nicely, to be possessed

2023-05-27 at 01:26:00: my skin is freakin out (mildly but more than usual) from the pizza i had yesterday aha

2023-05-26 at 18:19:28: campus yesterday (if only i felt as studious now as i did then) https://t.co/Z3VStVsLZA

2023-05-26 at 16:11:04: @TheGrandBlooms probably some truth to what you’re saying, i think i had a knee jerk response to reply because it felt like it minimized my OP (rest of thread articulates *my* definitions of conv/div thinking in this specific context)

2023-05-26 at 16:06:59: @TheGrandBlooms certainly divergent/convergent thinking is in play in other aspects of life. eg i’m reminded of cycles i go through with hobbies - “i wanna do all of them” (div) —&gt; sometimes leads to overwhelm, “ok let’s try this one thing for a bit” (conv)

2023-05-26 at 16:01:10: @TheGrandBlooms doesnt ring true for me and my set of experiences - preparing for this exam is helping me rein in divergent thinking in a way that feels novel &amp; special &amp; meaningful for me

2023-05-25 at 23:08:52: actually we’re gonna let “everybody wants to rule the world” by tears for fears run its radio course first

2023-05-25 at 23:06:55: a trip to the east bay wouldn’t be complete w/o bumpin darude sandstorm (from cd) in my humble prius. windows down letting the sun and breeze in, cruisin around the calm streets

2023-05-25 at 22:47:25: that has its implications for how people interact with me in the world but in general i love being a woman

2023-05-25 at 22:47:24: pondering in trader joe’s: is gender a system i feel comfortable with because it “serves me”? 

i don’t have too much friction w gender, some pain i’ve worked through wrt being female &amp; in my body; bottom line my energy feels dominantly feminine and my body matches that &amp;

2023-05-25 at 21:54:09: where we bring the ideas divergent thinking has generated back to reality, back to practice - and move closer to answering those scientific questions (which satisfies the bubbly curiosity of divergent thinking)

2023-05-25 at 21:54:08: divergent thinking tickles my scientific curiosity, but i can get distracted and hopeless if i don’t engage in

convergent thinking - like writing my aims and hypotheses. what are the specific questions *i* want to answer? also like experimental planning -

2023-05-25 at 21:50:46: realizing: getting ready for my qualifying exam is training in fluidly transitioning between convergent &amp; divergent thinking

2023-05-25 at 21:47:55: periodic reminder that if we are friends on here and you are an inst*gram user i would like to also be friends on there (dm me!)

2023-05-25 at 19:03:25: walking up n down euclid now in search of a place to eat, remembering the time boyf was deep in a “should i quit phd?” mini-crisis period. we met with a berkeley phd student over lunch at a sandwich place on euclid, and he strongly advised bf to just push through

2023-05-25 at 18:47:14: love coming here tho it’s always a portal to a younger version of myself

summer 2019 was first time visiting the campus, on a roadtrip with boyf, 3 days into dating :~)
truly an “i’m in california!!” moment
and since then many milestones/sub-eras have happened

2023-05-25 at 17:54:28: berkeley campus soooo quiet w/o undergrads

2023-05-25 at 04:14:33: @FractalAuth ahhh! that is rough ❤️‍🩹

2023-05-25 at 03:25:25: dont feel like working on work stuff yet so im gonna set a 20min timer and peruse book club book

2023-05-25 at 00:38:32: starting my mandated 1-2.5h chill. much needed after my second and final practice exam this afternoon (snippet of whiteboard below) which went on the whole good but just is challenging emotionally https://t.co/DmZ0u0tOTf

2023-05-24 at 04:43:36: added cardamom &amp; honey :)

2023-05-23 at 02:19:49: other conceptions i’ve felt of god/divinity: 

• loving awareness as fundamental substrate, just have to tap into non-separateness and that’s healing
• oneness with what you’re doing / flow states
• creation - puts you in contact w creative power bigger than yourself

2023-05-23 at 02:17:59: a loose set of thoughts:

who is _your_ god?

how can i engage with hinduism in a way that feels right to me?
(tired of forcing myself in some ways, sadness of falling out of enchantment)

in a way my pursuit of biology is a way i reach for god

2023-05-23 at 02:10:36: (b) is lookin more possible as of late with my recent dj-ing explorations &amp; forest explorations. have to find good speakers - decent sound/bass, ideally rechargeable, connect via wires to dj controller, carry-able on a slight hike to party spot 😇🌿

2023-05-23 at 02:08:36: two types of events i aspire to host are (a) small dinners and (b) small raves

2023-05-22 at 23:53:55: @teleosistem i’m arriving at a similar frame of: if i write for myself i think it’ll be worthwhile, satisfy that inner calling, contribute to development/deepening of some sort.

best of luck with your meditation writing endeavors!

2023-05-22 at 23:52:10: @teleosistem there’s something there, a vein to be tapped into, but if i frame it as writing for others i have some ick around it. like i don’t want to surface these things in a way thats like… performing trauma for an audience. but i also want to be vulnerable &amp; dive deep! &amp;…

2023-05-22 at 23:50:38: @teleosistem &gt; hard time motivating myself to write things for others but if I write it for myself and my own development I just might do it

this articulates something i’ve been feeling abt writing abt my experiences w childhood illness -

2023-05-20 at 05:52:33: yeah long distance generally not ideal but i do love the little ritual of getting dolled up before pickin babe up from airport 🥰💄✨🛫🌿

2023-05-20 at 02:14:00: @willlowthewhisp didn’t know you lived in oakland! associate you so strongly with canada haha

2023-05-19 at 23:38:28: @impartialpim curious what kind of “bad” u were at physics

2023-05-19 at 23:38:14: @impartialpim physics was always something i was curious about but i could never learn it the way it was taught in my ugrad… in grad school im coming back to it in a way that feels orthogonal and non-linear but also *right* for me (studying physics-y things in cells)

2023-05-19 at 18:30:44: @marshmarigold heck yeah

2023-05-19 at 01:06:03: @meridians_ &gt; the key I found is to plan something I will enjoy no matter what outcome

what a handy insight! thank you for your reply, it helped me feel more at peace

2023-05-19 at 01:04:06: life’s just one long bender

2023-05-19 at 01:04:05: some forest for my dear twitter people 🌿💚🌱 https://t.co/2dk3xD1Ule

2023-05-19 at 00:56:07: got to office but sadness swelled so big i felt i had to get out so i went to the forest and man did the forest soothe my soul

2023-05-18 at 22:30:21: hosting things takes a certain resilience huh - trying to host a thing saturday, the people i’ve invited thus far haven’t been responsive and i am trying not to take it personally 🙃

2023-05-18 at 19:01:07: remembering compassion towards myself when i feel disconnected from the divine

2023-05-17 at 20:42:55: my new favorite “street” in sf is oakhurst lane

2023-05-17 at 19:57:45: i don’t know exactly how it will feel but i think there’s a good chance i’ll like it

2023-05-17 at 19:57:05: i wanna get a snake stencil and use the henna i already have to give myself a temporary snake on my arm!

2023-05-17 at 03:39:23: @marshmarigold u better get paid 😤

2023-05-17 at 03:37:30: festival top prototype in progress :D ☀️ https://t.co/Y9YJHwR7iM

2023-05-16 at 20:11:23: i low key love lab meeting though… if i’m in a good headspace i’m great at being the center of attention and thinking on my feet and keeping things lighthearted but also alive. lab meeting is also an experience of being part of hive mind/collective conscious so thaaats sick

2023-05-16 at 20:04:04: @vlct0rs_tw1tter 💛💛 i love phd student life, i love that this is a thing i get to push myself to do because it just feels so right for me

2023-05-16 at 19:43:26: this morning i lightly oiled my hair with coconut oil and a little bit of thyme oil, then put my hair into two braids, and let me just say i look, feel, and smell fantastic hehe

2023-05-16 at 18:21:19: currently i feel anxiety in my chest and it makes me feel a little bit like i’m dying

2023-05-16 at 18:20:42: for 2 hours this afternoon i will be explaining my proposed research to my lab via drawing on the whiteboard, and will be fielding questions from every angle 😀🤪😅😎😌

2023-05-16 at 02:35:40: on the market for a very good review paper on membrane lipid biosensors

2023-05-15 at 00:46:34: when i get home, gonna lay out my groceries and write out a meal plan for the upcoming week :) will also get some quinoa going

2023-05-14 at 18:16:43: anybody have a lentil “meatloaf” kinda recipe they like?

2023-05-14 at 18:06:02: time to make myself eat some fuckin food

2023-05-14 at 08:54:45: i missed the first half but i had some lively conversation and made new friends!!! :))

2023-05-14 at 06:10:54: pulling up to party, don’t know if i am too late, we will see

2023-05-14 at 06:00:14: at the airport a few days ago, i was on on phone with bf speaking emphatically about being present for our future kids and ahh do i love envisioning the future and feeling it deep within. middle aged man gave me a strange look lol

2023-05-14 at 05:53:27: if u join just say hi and i’ll hop on :~)

2023-05-14 at 05:52:15: https://t.co/it3lsINSdb

2023-05-14 at 05:25:28: sooo proud &amp; pleased with myself, just put in 2.5 hours of work into some writing i have to do for phd stuffs &amp; sent off the updated version to the prof i’m meeting with on monday :) was considering putting this off to tomorrow but ah how nice to be done (for now)!

😌📚✍🏽🙏🏽☺️

2023-05-13 at 16:37:49: yesterday when i was extremely nauseous after a long night &amp; bc of the substances in my body — i was coming back into my body - most comforting thing was to lay my forehead and hands on my cat’s body. and then my body awareness only existed at our contact points

2023-05-13 at 16:36:04: ketamine is so strange it’s dissociative and somewhat disembodying but in the wake of last night’s experience i’m feeling more aware of my body in an interesting way

2023-05-13 at 07:14:17: @powerbottomdad1 meeee

2023-05-13 at 06:32:24: @veggiebat_ did ketamine for first time in a while was interesting now i’m at tail end but still spacey but mostly nauseous

2023-05-12 at 20:32:05: as of late this week i’m finally starting to feel excited about my qualifying exam next month. yesterday i was writing in my notebook, laying ideas out, and felt a warmth in my chest - felt an internal assurance that i would pass the exam :) 💗

2023-05-12 at 20:07:47: @nopranablem yes!!! 💗

2023-05-12 at 19:59:16: the way loving you brings me closer in contact with my dharma! ❤️‍🔥

2023-05-12 at 19:58:00: i pass dolores park on my commute every day! life is sweet

2023-05-12 at 19:19:26: have any of you successfully hacked a coin operated laundry situation? if so i may need you to transmit ur wisdom

2023-05-12 at 17:17:15: might also watch some youtube videos to learn basics of mixing techno, and practice w a few tracks. i’ve been having fun playing around but now i want some instruction/technique

2023-05-12 at 16:50:13: @KnotGrigori oh i love that for him! cigars were smoked at his bday party last weekend (at sunset) and that was a lovely time. i’ll see him next weekend and the one after 😛😄💕

2023-05-12 at 16:45:02: somehow, through the tides of life, a song i haven’t worked on since last june has resurfaced and my heart is very happy and taken with this pursuit. i love this portal of connecting to my past self 🥺 and expressing my energy thru somethin creative!!!

2023-05-12 at 16:28:14: also have to locate my passport 😬

2023-05-12 at 16:28:05: alright y’all i’m calling it, my wild friday night plans are to clean my frickin room. clutter has built up &amp; i have to create order/properly organize after moving last month. the physical clutter has reached a threshold in affecting mental clutter 📚🪑😫🪞⛲️

2023-05-12 at 03:21:08: @veggiebat_ teehee

2023-05-12 at 01:47:07: @veggiebat_ :’) 💘

2023-05-12 at 01:46:52: @s0ulDirect0r shorter term might take my controller to festival i’m goin to in early june :’)

2023-05-12 at 01:46:13: @s0ulDirect0r one slightly longer term vision is to dj at hot springs for last night of an annual science retreat in september hehehe

2023-05-11 at 19:46:00: @FractalAuth 😊🤲🏽🙏🏽💗

2023-05-11 at 18:59:43: @marshmarigold YUP

2023-05-11 at 18:54:04: playing around with two tracks - one with vocals n beats, one primarily beats. sometimes they sound really good together! sometimes you hear them going from one cohesive track to two distinct voices https://t.co/EsXt02gBIY

2023-05-11 at 18:41:52: @nat_sharpe_ freshly baked bread, freshly sliced n buttered, still warm!

2023-05-11 at 18:41:30: @nat_sharpe_ oh hell yeah love it ty nat!

2023-05-11 at 18:01:21: @kyzcralotSxaM she likened the promise she was asking me for to the promises my dad made when leaving india for the US - promises he made to his parents and to himself, to uphold his identity &amp; honor his roots

2023-05-11 at 17:59:05: @kyzcralotSxaM when i was younger i wanted a white/western name tho! lolol. in middle/early high school i asked my mom if i could legally change my name to teresa and she had a serious sit down convo with me where she asked me to promise her i wouldn’t change my name

2023-05-11 at 17:57:46: @kyzcralotSxaM yessss i feel like i’ve grown into it and it really does feel like the prettiest n most fitting name for who i am in this life. reminds me of a flowing, clear creek

2023-05-11 at 07:46:40: @Childermass4 uffff i’m so tempted but it would be a heck of a journey and i’ve never been to europe before!!! i also should probably not travel more than the plans i already have for that time of year 🥲 will u be doing again next summer??

2023-05-11 at 07:13:08: @Childermass4 yes hahaha i just kept goin n goin n goin, more kept arising and feeling constructive and connected. by the end i had to stop not because i had fully emptied myself but just cuz i was getting worn out!

2023-05-11 at 07:01:53: givin myself the cutest gf award 🥇

2023-05-11 at 06:53:24: @nat_sharpe_ ohooo yes pls

2023-05-11 at 06:33:42: @christineist yay! well a week or so ago bf mentioned a slightly older friend he views as role model. was thinking of such friends in my life and you are one! i find the way you engage with ur emotions fascinating &amp; i admire how you’re always doin things and channeling ur energy

2023-05-11 at 06:24:08: @pratibimbana fo sho multiple such decisions. one big one was moving cross country for a job on a week’s notice a few years ago. parents didn’t quite know how to orient towards it but mom said my astrology chart said i was kama oriented so she had to let me follow my intuition &amp; go

2023-05-11 at 06:10:17: @veggiebat_ big asynchronous haircut day! christine and me too! $19 at great clips 😌 https://t.co/f6kVR6ARIs

2023-05-11 at 06:00:49: holy fuck 8306 words

2023-05-11 at 04:22:23: will poast word count when i get home

2023-05-11 at 04:22:01: i may have just spent 4.5-5 hours of my flight journaling and intensely reflecting in my notes app what of it

2023-05-11 at 04:21:04: @nickcammarata can’t wait for the formal dining room meditation space &amp; in general to see how y’all occupy a HAUS! a castle, i mean haha

2023-05-11 at 04:19:44: @nickcammarata omg yesssssss! castle is happening! 🏰 excited for you guys 💗

2023-05-10 at 22:13:05: @responsiblparty thank you luke! do any handmade presents of note come to mind for you, either that you’ve given or received?

2023-05-10 at 22:12:23: @marshmarigold thank you!! canadian boyf will insist on calling it a toque… 😬 i refuse to give in 😑😂

2023-05-10 at 22:10:47: @meridians_ 🥰💚

2023-05-10 at 22:10:29: @veggiebat_ thank you!!! this lighting doesn’t even do it justice - it’s this kettle dyed yarn sourced from uruguay, when i worked with it the yarn had a lovely faint gradient from pale yellow to bright dark orange 💛🧡

2023-05-10 at 22:07:56: @br___ian also curious what kinda headphones u personally use. how much of an audiophile are u? 🧐

2023-05-10 at 22:07:20: @ElodesNL @br___ian 59k headphones?!!!

2023-05-10 at 20:57:22: stiff upper lip (as the bottom one trembles)

2023-05-10 at 01:37:18: @responsiblparty i been reflecting n living my relationship to cannabis too, more ups n downs since we last chatted :’)

2023-05-10 at 01:36:36: @responsiblparty interesting - what kinda grieving? grieving what?

2023-05-09 at 18:18:40: god willing 🧿

2023-05-09 at 18:04:32: @vals_pals_ not a direct response but i love bio “relentlessly mining my emotions” - feels v true and reflective of u

2023-05-09 at 18:02:17: long distance relationship as distortion of time. these last months seem like an eternity stretching forward, the years we’ve spent apart feel like forever, and yet we have the rest of a life together awaiting us

2023-05-09 at 14:50:03: @AnneSelke ah i’m having a similar feeling visiting hometown in east coast US! grateful SF / the west coast is my home. i like your follow-up line of thinking - though i’m not there, i’m having an immensely difficult time imagining coming back here haha

2023-05-08 at 17:38:59: @meridians_ awh lovely - may you have a wonderful retreat 🤍

2023-05-08 at 17:37:13: i’ve only read a quarter of glass bead game but one message i deeply appreciate from it is: along the path of listening to &amp; finding your calling, experiencing angst is natural &amp; even beautiful

2023-05-07 at 21:25:03: @veggiebat_ where ya headed?

2023-05-06 at 11:03:33: @embryosophy made it!!! 🙏🏽

2023-05-06 at 02:28:47: @embryosophy any good supportive vibes sent my way would be appreciated i am a little stressed!

2023-05-06 at 02:28:08: @embryosophy uhhhhh i’m heading home from happy hour/celebrations with colleagues to pack rapidly, move my car, and get to SFO in time for an 11pm flight!

2023-05-05 at 17:46:27: i’m sure some disillusionment will happen but my major “concern” with being a phd student is not that i will become jaded but that i will fall deeply in love with academia

2023-05-05 at 17:27:14: @meridians_ as i advance in my scientific career i’m interacting with more men who fit that description, and i have to be good about boundaries so i can enjoy connecting deeply about research without my brain auto-completing and thinking “am i into this person???”

2023-05-05 at 17:24:53: @meridians_ hehe true. more context: i’m building a life with a wonderful man who fits that description; and i largely liked the reality of academic lives/values i saw growing up. both my parents were academics - this allowed them flexibility so someone could always be home for kids

2023-05-05 at 15:52:24: (this was my first time spending hours with it and finally starting to have fun! the headphones cue-ing isn’t working yet, so limits my ability to make sure things sound ok before layering new track)

2023-05-05 at 05:06:15: behold i stood before my dj controller for a few hours this evening and here i what i have to offer u https://t.co/wmJgL7yUDj

2023-05-05 at 01:37:39: so grateful for the extra bone broth my housemate makes on a regular basis!

2023-05-05 at 00:51:26: i so hungies

2023-05-05 at 00:00:22: RT @eshear: @this_is_silvia just one more layer man, one more...i'm almost done clinging...let me just surrender one more layer, i promise

2023-05-03 at 18:02:31: either way the sun and the clouds affect all manner of living beings - especially plants - and i am a living being too so it is only natural i am affected by sunlight or lack thereof

2023-05-03 at 18:01:35: but then i thought of how clouds bring about peace in bf and sadness/slowness in me - we wonder if it has to do with his ancestors hailing from the shores of devon &amp; mine from the indian subcontinent 🌊⛈️/☀️🥭

2023-05-03 at 17:59:04: sun came out when i went on walk to move my car (street cleaning). noticed my mood improving from the sun, then began to chastise self for “requiring sun to feel good”. imagined long term potential future in cloudy vancouver (bf and i imagine one pot’l future as ubc profs ☺️🤪)

2023-05-03 at 02:49:31: @allisonwilens for much of my childhood i only had 3 cousins, all of whom lived across the world and our families’ consequent cultural differences were too broad a gap to bridge :’) it would have been nice to have a close extended family, but c’est la vie

2023-05-02 at 05:22:33: just drove 265 miles in one sitting whew that was a lot i really needed a break

2023-05-01 at 23:36:38: this is helping the sadness in my chest https://t.co/zc2RBCneWr

2023-05-01 at 23:09:27: i was so motivated to drive the 6 hours down to my love…. now for the drive back 😭💔

2023-05-01 at 19:44:38: @christineist @Jeanvaljean689 @vincent_yc_li i'm compelled by the few pages you posted, and i think i may already have a copy at home

2023-04-30 at 16:39:17: @responsiblparty 😂🙏🏽

2023-04-30 at 16:22:09: @responsiblparty came across this song yesterday and loved it, immediately listened to it 3x. such a banger

2023-04-29 at 05:59:22: @cursedmargarita watchu wanna write?

2023-04-29 at 04:05:09: boyf n i rollin up to evening plans, we’re such a cute and dynamic duo 🥰

2023-04-29 at 00:20:58: hmmm i wanna see trends for pediatric cancer mortality https://t.co/N6k9PBco0M

2023-04-28 at 17:29:45: oh yeah https://t.co/fdLGDWCu7R https://t.co/TyLNaFLDNQ

2023-04-28 at 15:59:00: @embryosophy LA for my love’s birthday :) 🥰

2023-04-28 at 01:39:11: tomorrow morning i get to give into my escapist inclinations and hit the open road ~~~

2023-04-28 at 00:16:05: @cIass_man great idea/visualization, ty! :)

2023-04-28 at 00:15:45: @meridians_ lovely, thank you for sharing &lt;3

2023-04-27 at 21:03:06: @veggiebat_ you n your space n the sky — ART!

2023-04-27 at 20:51:01: happened to sit next to a 4th year in my phd program on the bus into work and we had a lovely little chat!

2023-04-27 at 20:21:08: anyone have guided meditation recs for healing / grounding? i’m trying to see how i can use my mind to mitigate my uterus’s decision to freak out

2023-04-27 at 19:59:58: @viriditax 😂 glad ya asked. https://t.co/rUjuEIuEd7

2023-04-27 at 19:02:08: ummmm i’m drinking iron water and my sensory clarity is increasing, with a slight delay (5-10 min) after consumption

2023-04-26 at 18:44:48: @er1enney0ung oh eri i adore u

2023-04-26 at 18:42:28: called dad on drive over bay bridge, we talked about how the mind is like the wind &amp; how it likes to race; and how to shift my mind from the “worry lane” over to the “work lane” via all sorts of things but mainly exercise &amp; meditation

2023-04-26 at 16:17:11: high off three shots of the gum numbing stuff at the dentist 💉

2023-04-25 at 21:01:46: @meridians_ @veggiebat_ thank you shannon 💗☺️

2023-04-25 at 20:45:38: @veggiebat_ i could use some; i’ve been feelin a lil stuck in the boiler room this week… so much to do, so much to look forward to, so much i’m scared of https://t.co/VOsWm5YWgH

2023-04-25 at 02:37:17: about to meet a friend i haven’t seen since 2017! :o

2023-04-24 at 18:10:04: saturday night i drove back alone from a bonfire on muir beach to the city. i had the distinct sense that a version of myself from not so long ago would have found the twisty roads scary but instead i observed myself handling them with cool focus and tremendous peace of mind

2023-04-24 at 02:45:24: @myceliummage assimilating scientific knowledge whilst reading a paper is often a fun experience &amp; involves me intentionally taking deep breaths. other times i’m just tingly from the novelty of ideas presented &amp; the way the ideas sparkle with promise of interconnection

2023-04-24 at 02:43:44: @viriditax wow this is the energy i’m aspiring towards

2023-04-24 at 00:23:03: @AdamInProgress hmmm “mahadasha” is also coming to mind, idk if relevant

2023-04-24 at 00:22:15: @AdamInProgress i’ve heard of rahu and ketu but don’t really know what’s going on with them - could you explain the basic idea / offer a slice of what makes them so fascinating to u?

2023-04-22 at 17:02:24: @responsiblparty not from you specifically, i didn’t know the meme format and assumed that parental angle would come from a not excited/ready to chastise or “catch in the act” perspective

2023-04-22 at 16:57:30: @responsiblparty aw wow this is more wholesome and kind than i expected 🥹

2023-04-22 at 16:14:28: @DaltonDEmery first bit of this page is a book excerpt i think of in this territory - https://t.co/gpDNgxsQYl

2023-04-22 at 16:12:42: @DaltonDEmery i like “symbolic sight”

2023-04-22 at 16:11:05: wistful for the sun and company of my love in san luis obispo

2023-04-22 at 15:30:09: @sandseron1 @responsiblparty i was at a party being hosted in my house! (but i had gone to two science happy hours before that)

2023-04-22 at 15:29:39: @sandseron1 @responsiblparty no haha personally i probably wouldn’t mix alcohol and psytrance

2023-04-22 at 15:09:36: i got some exercise and fresh air ☀️
when i get home i’m gonna put the kettle on then wash my face and brush my teeth. then i’m gonna hydrate and eat a tasty, fatty breakfast. 
i will put my phone to charge and pack my hiking bag for the afternoon!
6 mi 2000ft up hike w friends…

2023-04-22 at 15:05:38: @sympatheticopp dang…

2023-04-22 at 15:04:40: reality distortion: i feel bad -&gt; subconscious belief “i am bad”

i feel bad because i am bad
this creates shame

when in reality there could be any number of internal or external things making u feel bad, many within ur control to act on fairly easily!

2023-04-22 at 14:18:26: @responsiblparty it sounds like a familiar format but i can’t think of the original thing! 😂😭

2023-04-22 at 14:15:34: @responsiblparty lololol just noticed tweet said “son”, not “so”

2023-04-22 at 14:15:14: @responsiblparty no, now i’m mildly hungover and up early as my body tends to do after alcohol - out for a walk

2023-04-22 at 03:22:40: confession: i am actually pretty cool

2023-04-22 at 03:20:01: since moving to the city i’ve been drawn to dressing in more lively, colorful clothes and ahh i love that! affirms my own vitality, life force energy

2023-04-22 at 03:17:08: i looove living in the city! it’s nice to be back after spending some time away

2023-04-21 at 22:08:45: @parakeetnebula immediately recalled simpsons seafood buffet episode

2023-04-21 at 22:07:22: it's also nice to read a math textbook authored by a woman. it makes me feel like, i can do this too. i read a little about the prof who authored those books. she seems great. i can't wait to feel her love in the pages and in her explanations

2023-04-21 at 22:02:34: in all seriousness i came across these books today and i'm the exact right target audience (biologist, scarred-by-maths &amp; yet still maths-curious)

2023-04-21 at 22:00:07: if u need me at the party tonight i'll be doing math in my room https://t.co/ewX7fE43eY

2023-04-21 at 16:41:54: @marshmarigold that makes a lot of sense. sending you strength, patience, n peace as things work themselves out

2023-04-21 at 16:40:50: @marshmarigold looks so yummy! what a nice plate of lunch!

2023-04-21 at 02:30:27: why’s my body craving starches so much! haha 🥔

2023-04-21 at 01:46:02: two wolves inside of me: (1) stay in and crochet at home, have cozy dinner with housemates; (2) yearning for an experience like psytrance at dna lounge

2023-04-21 at 01:43:43: ahhh yes i found a video tutorial! gonna go for a walk to get bubble tea then will come home n give it a try! the end goal is a hair band :D https://t.co/Z5qKMbkpeS

2023-04-21 at 01:41:39: i want to crochet this pattern so badly but this pattern diagram is all greek to me! https://t.co/AgjG0eT3Ye

2023-04-21 at 01:31:20: spotted in the mission and stopped me in my tracks ahaha iykyk https://t.co/nUgtiSPxz9

2023-04-21 at 01:29:15: @ulkar_aghayeva i could meet ya sometime may 2-5 and/or potentially provide a couch for a night or two

2023-04-20 at 17:59:25: @christineist awwwh! 🥰💗🌿💧 ty!

2023-04-20 at 06:41:17: @christineist compliment!!

2023-04-20 at 06:33:58: @marshmarigold how u feelin about 26? optimistic?

2023-04-20 at 06:33:27: @marshmarigold aww :( hbd tho!!! hope it was a good one and u got everything u wanted

2023-04-20 at 06:28:19: @embryosophy what does that look like for u? :) i recall an olive oil tincture? or something like that? that sounds suuuuper nice

2023-04-20 at 06:21:06: so how u guys celebrating the international holiday tomorrow (today for most of u)

2023-04-20 at 06:19:49: hmm… it may be time for me to put on some ambient music, log off, and read a paperback

2023-04-19 at 20:40:19: @christineist kaleidoscope christine! https://t.co/4KB7E83Y9b

2023-04-19 at 20:29:09: @meridians_ what does coming out of the cave involve?

2023-04-19 at 20:28:29: sooo nice to be able to leave the house at like 1:05 and feel confident i’ll make it in by my 2pm meeting (before moving i had to leave the house at 12:10-12:15 to ensure i could make the same meeting!)

2023-04-19 at 20:03:44: about to get high off knowledge lfg https://t.co/AdnJ1yvIYn

2023-04-19 at 18:39:24: @meridians_ 🤍 Mori and I bid you a good mornin &amp; afternoon too https://t.co/0prbuIlkM2

2023-04-19 at 04:59:50: @myceliummage YUP feelin it that's wild

2023-04-19 at 03:07:36: from @xiexiexiexiex specifically

2023-04-19 at 03:06:49: j’ai besoin de bisous!!

2023-04-18 at 21:16:08: @AnneSelke one idea: alternative nostril breathwork! you only have to do 8-10 rounds to sink fairly deep into it (takes a couple min). i like the yogic purpose of this exercise, which is to balance the sun/moon energy in your body. the feeling of actively balancing urself is nice

2023-04-18 at 19:33:45: any thoughts on how to exist with the self-doubt / fear of failure that arises when you’re undertaking a big endeavor for the first time? like, can i even do this?

2023-04-18 at 18:35:23: after looking into this a bit &amp; practicing a little, what feels most important now is balancing length of breaths on left &amp; right sides - that's how you balance ida/pingala (moon/sun) energy

2023-04-18 at 18:33:28: @s0ulDirect0r alas i have to be "productive" and focus on workin on a deliverable, but putting out there that we seem to both be in the bay and i'd love to meet at some pt!

2023-04-18 at 07:36:35: @meridians_ i don’t at present but this question made me think of the silly will ferrell movie “eurovision” - it’s goofy and funny and i have warm memories of watching it with partner a few years ago and giggling lots. so let’s go with that

2023-04-18 at 06:27:22: @MasterTimBlais @PiquantParvenu @MaryZoso @gptbrooke 👀☺️ @the_wilderless https://t.co/ZOgXCCQd61

2023-04-18 at 03:44:13: biiiig mudita vibes n feels lately ☀️☺️

2023-04-18 at 01:01:01: @relic_radiation i’d be interested :)

2023-04-17 at 17:50:44: do you visualize ida and pingala nadis (left/right streams of energy)? (i remember vaguely being taught this once)

2023-04-17 at 17:50:27: how do u guys be doing ur nadi shodana / alternate nostril. how long is the inhale/exhale? do u hold breath in between?

2023-04-17 at 17:46:54: kool kool kool guess i’m gonna go see if anyone’s made videos on the electrostatics of cell membranes

2023-04-17 at 17:44:57: @veggiebat_ thank you for asking :) hehe

2023-04-17 at 17:44:48: @veggiebat_ transcendent kingdom by yaa gyasi! it’s about neuroscience phd student, child of immigrants, her relationship to faith &amp; reconciling faith &amp; science &amp; the deep suffering she’s been witness to

2023-04-17 at 03:19:53: practically, one major part of keeping my channel clear involves doing the tasks my life demands of me and kindly dismantling my fear-based avoidance patterns

2023-04-17 at 03:18:27: there is something bigger than me that yearns to move through me and be expressed. it is not my job now to choose what that energy becomes. rather, my task is to keep my channel clear so that larger thing can emerge

2023-04-17 at 03:15:01: something about reading fiction that rhymes with my own experiences makes some parts of me feel deeply seen &amp; heard

2023-04-17 at 02:40:39: feeling lately: the only thing that will save me from myself is connection with the Absolute

2023-04-17 at 01:25:38: gonna do a lil guided nsdr to replenish dopamine, then layer up n head to new grocery store to grab ingredients for instant pot moroccan lentil soup recipe

2023-04-16 at 23:51:49: many ways of directing energy outward,
eg

talking to another human

reading a fiction book, allowing that narrative to take precedence for a bit (inner image of flipping lens)

2023-04-16 at 23:49:49: oftentimes when i’m tending towards negative thoughts about myself/the future, i find it’s because i’ve become overly internally focused. directing energy outward helps

2023-04-16 at 23:22:30: @veggiebat_ YUS i was patiently waiting for ur appearance on there

2023-04-16 at 20:52:50: @marshmarigold hahaha definitely something i’m proud of

2023-04-16 at 20:45:57: @marshmarigold i’m girl but 5:04

2023-04-16 at 20:43:33: filed my state taxes, paid quarterly estimated taxes, ordered new glasses and prescription sunglasses (i’ve been putting this off for months!) 💪🏽☀️ now for some food and outside time

2023-04-16 at 19:54:13: @christineist perhaps i could give this a try for my qualifying exam prep :o

2023-04-15 at 17:28:46: @veggiebat_ done ♥️

2023-04-14 at 22:02:34: @PrinceVogel @natural_hazard amen

2023-04-14 at 22:00:33: @PrinceVogel ah! i'm sorry. i like to "like" liberally but i don't assign as much meaning to like/reply order. ik @natural_hazard has a thing where he wants to keep tweet # &gt; likes #. diff people have diff deals

2023-04-14 at 21:46:24: @veggiebat_ i want too!

2023-04-14 at 21:45:20: @PrinceVogel thank u for bringing sf one to my attention lol &amp; hope your event goes wonderfully!

2023-04-14 at 20:03:25: i frickin love biophysics! love that biology is my path to physics

2023-04-14 at 06:13:22: @algekalipso libertine eros fig!

2023-04-14 at 05:47:49: @veggiebat_ hehe thank you! 💗 much appreciated

2023-04-14 at 00:50:12: @the_wilderless i’ve been listening to this over the past few days and it’s helped dispel that vague shame / sense that “this is not good for me” by providing quite a lot of interesting objective information https://t.co/PLniRTx4Ci

2023-04-14 at 00:35:23: fun social weekend plans are coming together 🥰 also gripped by a desire to search for art in thrift stores - perhaps i’ll add that to the weekend plans!

2023-04-13 at 23:04:07: @marshmarigold coot

2023-04-13 at 23:03:43: nobody told me that when life got better i would gain a new worry - losing that which made life better. coveting the freshness and positivity and wanting it to last forever

2023-04-13 at 22:48:15: @marshmarigold my gut response: just talk to people more. esp people you feel safe around. when you talk to others you gain their vocabulary for things. you also practice articulating urself and get better through iteration

2023-04-13 at 22:28:38: getting a feeling from life that i’ve passed through some transition that needed to happen. like, the heavy lifting is done, you’ve made the change you needed to, now you can relax into this new life &amp; learn by being attentive to and present with its unfolding

2023-04-13 at 22:23:12: i love that the 5 koshas each have “maya” in their names. that we honor the goddess in each of those labels

2023-04-13 at 22:21:08: i love the compactness of my physical body (annamaya kosha)

2023-04-13 at 21:55:02: @yokaihainen brb finding u and liking posts

2023-04-12 at 17:58:29: to the east bay! 🚗•••✨

2023-04-12 at 05:21:36: twitter/bluesky tl was feelin too impersonal so i messaged two dear offline friends and i feel much better

2023-04-10 at 03:14:53: moving weekend is proving to be rewarding but far more exhausting than expected!

2023-04-10 at 02:47:28: 👀🙏🏽💕 https://t.co/exdsqL09Q4

2023-04-08 at 23:58:26: @bunbury_exe sick!!

2023-04-07 at 20:46:07: @FractalAuth @the_wilderless @embryosophy @s0ulDirect0r @nvpkp @myceliummage me too! :’)

2023-04-07 at 18:08:15: to be clear, work will continue, but i am moving this weekend &amp; my commute will be shorter!

2023-04-07 at 17:53:17: last time doing my 1h15 commute in to work!

2023-04-07 at 00:51:26: @veggiebat_ oo mid june is right after my qualifying exam… maybe i could justify a trip up to portland

2023-04-06 at 19:41:16: @RichardMCNgo hmm, i’m moving back to the city and feel oppositely - lots of potential for close friendship, facilitated by geographical closeness &amp; potential for both fun &amp; mundane shared experiences

2023-04-05 at 18:24:56: @_StevenFan i felt this way when i tidied my room this weekend - but now i’m packing to move, a little day by day, and there’s always a mess somewhere or some progress to be made deconstructing my home 😭 it’ll be worth it though!

2023-04-05 at 16:36:46: think i’ll go work in the berkeley life sciences library this aft (have to return a bunch of books too)

2023-04-05 at 00:18:30: love this bookmark https://t.co/i9Sqh4w3dc

2023-04-05 at 00:07:07: RT @wholebodyprayer: Could we scale back the talk of universal love and scale up whatever it is we each need to love each individual person…

2023-04-04 at 03:07:09: a few weeks ago i discovered this khruangbin album, here is one of my fav songs from it: https://t.co/KnfytobpiN

2023-04-03 at 03:06:59: effortless flow state cooking tonight. blessed

2023-04-03 at 02:24:19: @veggiebat_ ur face here made me smile :)

2023-04-02 at 19:44:03: @ruth_hook_ waaaait is there a link?

2023-04-01 at 22:59:18: walking around lake merritt feeling like @christineist

2023-04-01 at 00:18:36: hm thinking about building life around what gets u sustainable dopamine hits

2023-03-31 at 19:45:02: alternatively stated: my experience of the world has gotten better since i stopped pathologizing my need for connection!

2023-03-31 at 19:42:55: i’m starting to become aware of what’s going on with my dopamine at any given time. i heard about the “dopamine wave pool” metaphor in a huberman podcast snippet yesterday - it’s super helpful

2023-03-31 at 19:00:31: me to me: guess what it's safe to seek connection! you're not being too much!

2023-03-31 at 17:19:36: looking forward to starting that after work today… my big work task for today is getting my proposal’s aims page drafted and to my advisor for our 2pm meeting 😭😅 i’ve got like a thousand words down just have to revise n refine now

2023-03-31 at 17:17:53: my big project for this weekend is decluttering &amp; organizing &amp; starting to pack for next weekend’s move!

2023-03-30 at 17:01:26: @flybottlemist hallo please divine my class good sir

2023-03-30 at 15:33:21: so what i’m hearing is… i have just about 2 weeks to get my first and likely only viral tweet? 👀😂

2023-03-30 at 15:10:32: first time waking up at 7am in a while and wow i missed spending time with myself like this. exist quietly, let my attention scan my surroundings and guide what i do next. all my tasks get done, but i don’t have many thoughts. music in the background is nice

2023-03-30 at 03:41:21: https://t.co/wrca6kfwps

2023-03-29 at 19:03:16: the mountains’ quiet majesty, british columbia https://t.co/8dMMzbyxO3

2023-03-29 at 18:32:06: @myceliummage would if i could!

2023-03-29 at 15:34:02: @__drewface design social environments to meet your needs &amp; "dropping the ball is part of playing the game" have been particularly helpful for me recently!

2023-03-29 at 05:12:03: hehehe i’m gonna start working on a bioinformatics side project at work i’m so stoked

2023-03-29 at 01:07:06: why would i force myself to be different when this is where my strength and joy lies?!

2023-03-29 at 01:05:55: i looove connecting with people. i love taking an interest in strangers, like the funny french family i ran into over lunch today, or the bus driver reading a book over her break. being warm and open to abundant connection is a state that feels so natural!

2023-03-29 at 01:03:17: i’m finding immense power in honoring my truth, that i do really love being around people

for a long while i thought that in order to “grow spiritually/personally”, i had to isolate myself. but there’s no need to force myself to be alone!

2023-03-28 at 20:03:59: turns out expressing my needs/feelings gently is an excellent way to get them addressed &amp; offers an opportunity for connection and resolution!

2023-03-28 at 19:39:07: ok kool https://t.co/gdaeo7aXsZ

2023-03-28 at 18:24:48: hallo from BART, it’s nice to be inside somewhere while it’s on and off pouring outside and mad windy. the train screeching on the tracks is always worst around 12/19th st oakland, and again partway through the under-the-bay stretch

2023-03-28 at 04:07:16: yeah well this is scarily accurate - not the esfj description but rather the cognitive function stack. https://t.co/ftlHPqr1Pl

2023-03-28 at 04:05:55: umm took mbti test for first time in many years and got esfj when before i'd always get infj

2023-03-28 at 02:14:51: i feel a greater acceptance towards myself, which enables me to weather the day’s challenges with grace and kindness i didn’t know i had. i feel like a kind radiant little being moving about spreading the light inside me

2023-03-28 at 02:11:48: after this weekend with partner &amp; his family i just feel so gosh darn good and secure in the world. upon returning to my normal life, i’m noticing i just wanna keep doing things! keep acting!

2023-03-27 at 21:07:11: @s0ulDirect0r :) it’s quite a journey! grateful for this 5 to 6 year long container for self-discovery, learning, and achieving mastery

2023-03-27 at 21:03:45: but yeah i’m sitting outside eating my lunch in short sleeves this is pretty fucking sweet

2023-03-27 at 21:03:16: sure feels nice to fly back home to sunny california after the cloudiness and mild chill of vancouver (which was lovely! got some quality time with bf’s fam 🥰)

2023-03-27 at 16:12:50: @s0ulDirect0r thank you! proposal is for my phd qualifying exam, in it i write about my research plans for the next year

2023-03-27 at 15:16:10: @s0ulDirect0r gm! flying back from vancouver, gotta send some emails, stop by work to take care of cells, go home n nap, read a couple papers and bang out a first draft of a proposal’s background &amp; aims page

2023-03-24 at 18:26:52: @evelynharlow_ what on earth is a placenta cake!

2023-03-23 at 19:50:38: love being in tissue culture room by myself cuz i can sing while working ☺️

2023-03-23 at 16:37:11: running taught me of the transience of emotions

2023-03-23 at 06:03:07: hi friends wassup with u

2023-03-23 at 01:37:29: @gptbrooke been holding this in the back of my head https://t.co/OIluH7ROxe

2023-03-23 at 01:36:39: @gptbrooke big same

2023-03-22 at 17:11:47: flow cytometry training day 3 at work today 😎 i love learning how to operate fancy machines

2023-03-22 at 03:00:30: i think as i sort out this loving myself unconditionally thing it will allow me to love you in the way you deserve to be loved

2023-03-22 at 02:58:48: https://t.co/3VF76U9Yus

2023-03-22 at 02:58:37: favs from tonight’s cookin n dancing:

2023-03-22 at 02:53:23: ah! just over 48 hours til i can melt into the warm embrace of my partner

2023-03-21 at 20:50:10: in my head this song is about japa yoga (chanting of sacred words) https://t.co/xVt3fsTHIS

2023-03-21 at 19:11:40: so i think i’m gonna try winding this hank of yarn into a ball once i board the bus… hopefully i can figure it out in 30 min haha

2023-03-21 at 18:57:17: found a $7 sweater yesterday that’s 70% lambs wool, 20% angora (rabbit wool!!) and 10% nylon! wearing it out today and i am so frickin cozy

2023-03-21 at 01:01:23: feels like it gives me permission to yearn for the kind of love &amp; closeness &amp; social interaction i desire (and work towards it) - instead of beating myself up about desiring it

2023-03-21 at 00:59:54: “I can take bigger risks when I'm loved, and spend much less time self-soothing” !! https://t.co/hqHooWZrrk

2023-03-21 at 00:14:11: got yarn! will have to manually wind it into balls. i should really make a gauge swatch before diving into the pattern…

2023-03-20 at 23:03:27: mid-afternoon field trip to the mission to buy some yarn, then back to lab. such is grad student life!

2023-03-20 at 18:54:30: @scrapbookhattie fuck, desire for billowy gingham dress ACTIVATED

2023-03-20 at 16:47:55: getting so stoked for this weekend’s trip to vancouver!

2023-03-20 at 03:44:27: grateful for khruangbin

2023-03-20 at 03:40:38: @choosy_mom 😅😅😅

2023-03-19 at 21:43:24: cracking up joyfully at the idea of lakshmi dating multiple gods and eventually being “truly domesticated” by vishnu. who knew goddesses could be so relatable https://t.co/LQzFsTosyC

2023-03-19 at 21:39:54: bruh so i keep seeing these guna-goddess associations:

lakshmi 🔸 rajas - activity
durga 🔸 tamas - negativity/inertia
saraswati 🔸 sattva - harmony

kinda interesting

2023-03-19 at 21:27:18: @donmexlar so tiny and delicate it made me shiver a lil when i finally saw the moon

2023-03-19 at 21:26:31: @tasshinfogleman very relatable sentiment https://t.co/iszXVkSuf7

2023-03-19 at 21:25:38: want her back 💔

2023-03-19 at 21:25:09: growing up and until recently, i thought my parents had named me for the goddess parvati. but my dad said in passing — we named you for durga

feels symbolic. the archetype i thought i was versus “who i really am”

2023-03-19 at 21:19:35: throwback to when my ego dissolved or at least became extremely malleable for 6 weeks last summer

2023-03-19 at 21:00:53: @protomneme @christineist i relate to difficulty being alone with self, and history of over-seeking connection with others. i’ve found the more i can keep my ego in check, the more enjoyable time by myself is

2023-03-19 at 20:58:52: @protomneme @br___ian and i were talkin about this a few months ago - realizing we can talk to ourselves and hear ourselves out

2023-03-19 at 20:41:42: savoring that warm blossom of well-being, safety, and contentment after eating a meal that satiates me

2023-03-19 at 18:50:52: @donmexlar jolly rancher of freedom! what a phrase!

2023-03-19 at 18:48:23: my legs feel so frickin good after getting a run in yesterday!

2023-03-19 at 17:53:48: this one goes so hard https://t.co/iVhZvxGmUm

2023-03-19 at 05:21:27: still waiting to hear back about rental application. i think i might say no even if it gets approved! :o

it’s been valuable to genuinely consider the prospect of moving &amp; improving my commute / daily life

2023-03-19 at 02:26:12: funny how loneliness can stem both from inadequate connection to others and inadequate connection to self

2023-03-18 at 05:35:12: @veggiebat_ v cute, i esp love the hoop earrings with the beads/stones situation goin on

2023-03-18 at 05:24:02: oh i think i’m experientially deepening my understanding of svādhyāya (self-study, chanting of sacred texts/japa) - that is a process that is unfolding for me now

2023-03-18 at 03:12:10: being with friends and feeling emotionally safe - all parts of me, including that mindful psychedelic / altered states of consciousness appreciator, and that soft hearted self who wants to be the best she can be for all those around her… i’m stoking that inner joy fire

2023-03-18 at 03:09:28: in our meeting today my advisor could tell i was in a low state after the past few weeks, especially this past one. he encouraged me to orient towards things that bring me joy, even if they aren’t the most practical. he said it’s valuable to learn how to recover from low periods

2023-03-18 at 03:07:37: first set of friends was home! i’ve taken so many notes already on plant biology and fun science and also psychological things

2023-03-18 at 01:34:20: i’ve set off on a long walk, perhaps i will keep walking and trying friend’s places until i find a friend who is home hehehe

2023-03-17 at 19:39:11: @veggiebat_ v good and hehe ofc 💕

2023-03-17 at 18:18:42: @veggiebat_ are u warm enough in your home?

2023-03-16 at 16:18:43: @responsiblparty i’m aware

2023-03-16 at 07:02:52: @veggiebat_ what mountain is that in the distance?

2023-03-16 at 07:02:33: @veggiebat_ ah wow so lovely 🤍

2023-03-16 at 05:53:45: @petrichor_lull hope u have a nice flight! :)

2023-03-16 at 05:51:55: @responsiblparty at that moment i was walking home from a friend's looking forward to my evening practice

2023-03-15 at 18:54:38: @donmexlar https://t.co/KrRODTDvaL

2023-03-15 at 07:08:46: @s0ulDirect0r ☺️🙏🏽☀️

2023-03-15 at 06:57:50: @_StevenFan what are the consequences of preventing dendritic pruning?

2023-03-15 at 05:18:54: can’t wait 2 hang out with god

2023-03-15 at 02:41:07: @yassoma i'm not worried, i trust that the powers that be know the true contents of one's heart

2023-03-15 at 01:59:50: working on a rental application! would appreciate any positive energy directed my way 💗

2023-03-14 at 02:29:46: fog rollin in, santa cruz https://t.co/yuPvvYwjKF

2023-03-14 at 02:22:10: she was a complete black box to me before. but now we’ve liked each others’ posts about our respective boyfriends (implicit approval); and she sent me a baby photo of me with my mom i’d never seen before :’)

2023-03-14 at 02:20:26: grateful for this window into her world - getting to know who she is as a person!

2023-03-14 at 02:19:56: ok so i only have 3 cousins on my dad’s side. i know very little about them, we haven’t had a way or reason to connect &amp; there’s been heavy family stuff ongoing. however! i recently found my one cousin on insta and she posts a ton and i feel like i’m finally getting 2 know her 😭

2023-03-14 at 02:11:57: i’m at lab retreat in a big house in santa cruz and i’m chillin in my room on phone with bf. i can hear my labmates hanging out and starting to cook dinner and it is very cozy. grateful for these experiences, opportunities to grow closer 💓

2023-03-12 at 07:42:24: @quotidiania @friedtrucknuts very cozy! i like the different patterns of sweater and pants, they complement each other. the pants are such a good statement piece!

2023-03-12 at 06:48:32: last time i drove my car was 8 days ago lol i really don’t drive that much right now. but it felt so good to be out and about! i felt tremendously agentic

2023-03-12 at 06:46:40: proud of myself for getting out and doing things today! drove into the city to check out a potential future home (🤞❤️‍🔥), stopped by work, had a call with mom about insurance stuff, drove back across bay bridge for dinner w friend

2023-03-12 at 06:45:01: driving home from dinner with a friend, first order of business when i get home is my evening sadhana

2023-03-11 at 22:11:51: undirected mind spinning with nowhere to go? play some bhajans and redirect ur mind to GOD 😤😌

2023-03-10 at 18:37:21: @TheGrandBlooms last summer when i discovered the power of routine https://t.co/pUntzVTrRZ

2023-03-10 at 07:50:51: good night twitter! may you get a good night of rest, and may you wake up with joy in your heart 🌙

2023-03-10 at 03:54:50: i foresee major quality of life improvements once i get my sewing machine and figure out how to take in the waist of all the pants i have that don’t fit!!! it seems like in many cases all u have to do is sew a dart. i can figure out how to do that!

2023-03-10 at 03:34:18: @tramazonflora oh wow so sick to see this info in this format! resonance w shadow aspects of tara, tripura sundari, tripura bhairavi, and chinnamasta… and what’s cool is the light flip side is exactly the value to refocus on 🤯🌸

2023-03-10 at 03:30:09: also lol workin on a new/slightly diff username so that it is more easily pronounce-able. would happily take any suggestions

2023-03-10 at 03:29:13: ahhhh what a relief to feel again that there is more to life, that there are vast terrains to explore and discover within myself. that my efforts could actually lead to fruition!

2023-03-10 at 03:15:33: RT @wholebodyprayer: alright overthinkers. Lets commit to more DANCE, SINGING, MASSAGE, COOKING WITHOUT RECIPES, ART WITHOUT OUTCOMES, PLAY…

2023-03-10 at 02:26:12: spent the day at home by myself feeling my feelings (scary, lots of them, lots i’ve been avoiding) but i have to say now a deep gratification has set in!

2023-03-10 at 01:58:39: @responsiblparty awh

2023-03-09 at 00:11:41: calling in a cozy 4-6 person home in the city, within comfortable commuting distance to work, with room for me, my cat, and in a few months my partner too

2023-03-08 at 16:54:20: @alexeyguzey so good! needed to know 42 five years ago but better late than never

2023-03-07 at 21:43:33: whole new frame! rings true https://t.co/GP4eLaskiS

2023-03-07 at 21:23:09: wanna skip to the part where i know how to sustain my energy ahaha https://t.co/nb9Ob4GR5U

2023-03-07 at 21:09:10: also this. big if true! feels like it could very well be true. i also associate jessica with “caring adult count”, which is another useful concept :) https://t.co/rVhJDmwrXa

2023-03-07 at 21:01:18: i want to lean into my science and let my love &amp; dedication consume me

2023-03-07 at 20:53:09: i think the artist i most viscerally love is daphni. put off listening to his stuff for a little bit, then heard a snippet several months ago and just knew i’d love anything of his

2023-03-07 at 20:43:54: do u guys oscillate between periods of high and low confidence too? does it get better as you get older?

2023-03-07 at 20:23:51: what if i turned towards those things i’m avoiding with full knowledge that they cannot hurt that which i truly am (brahman)

2023-03-07 at 20:20:35: it’s a big part of me and i been sleepin on it a bit as of late :) would love to talk to other people about this too if it’s of mutual interest :)

2023-03-07 at 20:19:04: i really gotta get back on my love of hinduism and joy of learning to exist as a woman within that framework

2023-03-07 at 19:39:40: “creating without fear” has stuck in my head ever since i first saw this tweet! i want to understand what that means for me https://t.co/LhMvNcpFSO

*how i want to be in the world, what my principles are, subconscious limiting beliefs

2023-03-04 at 00:59:46: @this_is_silvia lovely, thank you! 💕

2023-03-03 at 20:32:18: panic attack! at the gym

2023-03-03 at 17:14:15: @this_is_silvia congrats on surpassing ur goal for last year!

2023-03-02 at 06:49:59: love a good tipsy walk home

2023-03-02 at 01:08:21: and again! time to make myself a cuppa tea and read chapter for book club meeting this evening

2023-03-01 at 04:55:15: ok setting a timer to intentionally do something other than manically working on my creative project lolol

2023-02-26 at 00:37:36: @nickcammarata hehe ty i think so too :)

2023-02-25 at 23:23:08: @the_wilderless i been tryna activate that region when i strength train, squeezing rhomboid muscles in towards spine

2023-02-25 at 10:31:01: TIL that bay leaf gives dishes a slightly sweet, tea-like note

2023-02-25 at 10:14:03: aaa so excited to be diving into music making as a means of authentic self expression

2023-02-25 at 10:13:33: but i have a midi controller that’s compatible already so i can play with that for now!

2023-02-25 at 10:13:02: so i have to figure out what audio interface and cables to order so i can record my synth into ableton…

2023-02-25 at 07:50:01: friday nite samosa chaat has been assembled! https://t.co/2znoLcvJMQ

2023-02-25 at 02:58:37: dis me 😌 https://t.co/NVt9fkt5dm

2023-02-25 at 02:54:46: i expressed this sentiment out loud to two of my labmates and they said it was a silly and very characteristic of me thing to say

2023-02-25 at 01:50:33: @christineist pretty fuckin juicy

2023-02-24 at 22:00:44: i kinda like the stormy weather in the bay this past day and a bit. nice to have the opportunity to steady myself against an external challenge

2023-02-24 at 21:58:52: i kinda feel like the Trick is to find a way of accepting exactly where you’re at. and then things can flow as they need to, towards resolution on their own terms. you are but a vessel, my friend, and your task is to dissolve all barriers between yourself and Now

2023-02-24 at 21:13:00: like the duration of long distance is something at least ime you try *not* to think about, you just trust that at the end it will feel so worthwhile. then you can look back together and marvel

2023-02-24 at 21:11:03: literally unthinkable

2023-02-24 at 21:10:41: one of my mentors did long distance with his wife for SEVEN years

2023-02-24 at 21:06:39: no more ruminating even if it feels a lil pleasant, time to read about plant endomembranes

2023-02-24 at 02:38:38: - exercise (strength train either mid morning or mid-afternoon, run anytime mid-day onwards)
- eating enough and on time
- sleeping ideally 7.5-8h
- processing emotions via journaling and experiencing
- checking in &amp; staying connected w fam and long dist bf
- creativity! hobbies!

2023-02-24 at 02:30:25: i’ve got 2/4 members sorted :D earlier this week i had 0/4

2023-02-24 at 02:29:18: i am v happy to be making progress on assembling my qualifying exam committee!

2023-02-23 at 16:50:11: reflections as grad student w super flexible working hours: it is rarely ever about the time i get to work, what is more important to do the things to get my mind and body and spirit into good shape for solving problems

2023-02-23 at 04:27:39: funny to observe n bring greater awareness to how my anxious attachment patterns perpetuate beliefs n behaviors in close relationships

2023-02-23 at 03:24:23: @christineist i’ve been thinkin about how our relationships (at least close n healthy ones) help us distill each of our essences!

2023-02-23 at 00:14:25: ordering primers! https://t.co/hM2FbXW49r

2023-02-22 at 18:14:35: tryna be a never-ending well of positivity

2023-02-22 at 18:05:36: can there be separation between missing a person and missing what they bring out in you?

Deepen into direct experience

Notice that direct experience contains a LOT more than you tho…

2023-02-21 at 17:24:33: i get to welcome a friend to san francisco today! it’ll be her first time here. i’m excited to show her my home n see it through new eyes myself

2023-02-21 at 17:19:30: @ElodesNL @nosilverv super interesting and resonant!

2023-02-21 at 06:50:36: had a good leg day! ordered egg white protein powder!

2023-02-21 at 05:01:04: @danielbrottman thanks for your perspective daniel, no worries. i was soliciting hindu opinions because i feel i’ve seen plenty of discussion on this topic as it relates to buddhism, which is ofc broadly relevant but i’m a little tired of transposing what is said there to what makes sense for me

2023-02-20 at 22:04:36: it is empowering to elucidate your values and to life a life aligned with them

2023-02-20 at 21:36:49: i am never as Bad as i think i am. how can i so easily forget about my redeeming qualities!

2023-02-20 at 21:36:24: i am discovering yet again that even if i am consumed by thoughts of comparison or inferiority, i must find a way to love where i am at

2023-02-20 at 21:29:06: it seems like there are no hard and fast rules. i’m trying to understand what my adopted belief system (hinduism) has to say, so that i can sit with it as a value and use these values to guide my actions

2023-02-20 at 21:26:42: @AdamInProgress @bluechairgirly @kbala444

2023-02-20 at 21:25:12: curious if hindu homies have thoughts on yogic values &amp; substance use, especially but not necessarily cannabis

like afaik there’s no direct equivalent to buddhist precept to abstain from intoxication. the niyama of shaucha comes to mind, maybe - purity of mind, speech, body

2023-02-20 at 18:38:16: @adrusi big same this tweet re appeared in my mind this morning and i scrolled through my likes to find it

2023-02-19 at 09:07:28: i’ve been doing lots of emotional work i think i deserve a late night pop tart

2023-02-19 at 01:28:47: perhaps a nice next crochet project would be a couple trinkets for friends - coasters, lil wall hangings. i have some bigger clothing projects i’m envisioning / starting to work on, but they can be intimidating &amp; i just gotta keep the momentum going n the creative energy flowin’

2023-02-19 at 01:23:40: how do you return to or reconnect with your natural goodness?

2023-02-18 at 22:38:02: tryna cultivate my gentleness

2023-02-18 at 00:29:58: oh man it might be a frozen pizza kinda evening i am so here for it

2023-02-18 at 00:27:21: yay for getting home from work when the sun’s still up!

2023-02-18 at 00:14:46: i’m just so excited about the transition from long distance to living together. makes my heart feel buoyant. several more months yet, but the future draws closer with every passing day &lt;3

2023-02-18 at 00:12:16: oh here have some microscope pictures of cells https://t.co/dx3goQJ3up

2023-02-18 at 00:03:07: yesterday the french postdoc advised on how to fix my HEK cell culture techniques, including a step where before trypsin u rinse with PBS so all serum is removed from cells, cuz FBS quenches the trypsin &amp; makes it less effective. i noted this in obsidian &amp; dreamt about it ln

2023-02-17 at 23:59:55: bruh when i come back to work monday my HEKs better be nice n healthy and 90% confluent… and may my low population transduced neutrophil line recover so i can sort it &amp; use it for experiments!!

2023-02-17 at 17:46:23: @powerbottomdad1 this is great! really enjoyed reading it, appreciate ur perspective

2023-02-17 at 17:34:35: today we use the flow cytometer to sort my cells &amp; see if the transfection n transduction were successful!

2023-02-17 at 17:31:52: it’s ok tho it should get me the calories i need, and i’d say it’s a decent lunch for the last work day of the week!

2023-02-17 at 17:28:51: two minimalist ham n cheese sandwiches and a clif bar lunch today kinda day

2023-02-17 at 07:15:57: @marshmarigold :( 🌿 have u tried l-theanine with or without weed?

2023-02-17 at 06:41:25: ok my goal is to wake at 730am tomo!

2023-02-16 at 19:42:16: journaled and realized i was hating on a tendency of mine - a part if you will - that only means well!

2023-02-16 at 18:00:20: being a grad student in ur element is wonderful bc you get to be highly agentic and active

2023-02-16 at 05:52:56: @christineist have u always been able to harness this energy? if not was there a transition point?

2023-02-14 at 05:23:11: wow it’s so nice to text back n forth with friends when u see their typing bubbles and know they’re waiting for urs

2023-02-13 at 23:59:54: @AnneSelke @profeshkitten me 2!

2023-02-13 at 19:34:08: better to embrace it than to deny it

2023-02-13 at 19:33:25: i guess now we hunker down in this body and be with the internal storm and battering hail, that crackling anxiety in my chest and arms

2023-02-13 at 19:31:40: nervous system alarm bell keeps ringing! even though i did my morning routine and prayers and ate breakfast and commuted (commuting) to work. i even made a call to sort out a medication thing that was stressing me &amp; it got sorted way easier than expected

2023-02-13 at 16:39:16: @hamzaiandafirst my spiritual text asserts that voluntary action is very much real so i will continue to believe that

2023-02-13 at 02:28:15: @tasshinfogleman east of eden!!!

2023-02-13 at 02:27:28: @hamzaiandafirst 💯 tho it’s an interesting interplay between god’s plan/supremacy and the human capacity for voluntary action (as opposed to instinctual action)

2023-02-13 at 01:57:17: but i am reading a spiritual text now and things are clicking or at least soothing my spirit. i will continue to turn towards my faith 🤎

2023-02-13 at 01:56:18: for the last few weeks i have had moments where i feel hopeless when i think about the future. i think about my own bad traits and how life sometimes feels out of control, and i wonder, how can i trust that this will get better? what will convince me?

2023-02-12 at 00:44:17: @altashtree 💖☀️💕

2023-02-12 at 00:44:06: @altashtree it is beautiful out! we went on a hike closer to coast earlier, was windier there, calmer here!

2023-02-11 at 16:51:46: strength trained 3x this week and i am obsessed with how lovely it feels to be occupying this body… that sweet sweet delayed onset muscle soreness

2023-02-11 at 06:33:47: @christineist @simiiform yayyy!!! the pt worked!

2023-02-11 at 04:24:26: want to snuggle w bf but he is 400 miles away!

2023-02-11 at 01:58:13: so when u deadlift do you keep ur core braced the whole set or do you brace and re-brace at some point during the movement?

2023-02-10 at 05:05:13: currently makin potato leek lentil soup n banana bread

2023-02-09 at 20:30:42: guess who’s a lil depressy and negative cuz she had a drink last night

2023-02-09 at 20:23:12: tracing narratives in my head and dissolving them once i find they’re based on a panicked thought, not ground reality

2023-02-09 at 20:21:51: oh the power of, “if this is really a problem, it will still exist when i’m in a better headspace”

2023-02-09 at 01:51:39: i know im gonna have massive fomo but i might have to make the “not going to vibecamp” call. significant phd milestone will likely be happening mid-june, and moving house around that time too!

2023-02-08 at 02:14:42: i worked out and had a Good work day today and now on my commute i have blessedly fewer thoughts than usual. feels like each thought can rise up and be considered then dissolve

2023-02-08 at 02:10:20: rational mind wants to figure everything out before taking a step forward, thinking 1) it can predict the future, 2) it is in control of the future. no, sweet mind. the future is beyond the scope of our comprehension &amp; god/karma is the orchestrator

2023-02-08 at 02:05:46: i was just gonna keep thinkin when i was in fact ready to start acting!

2023-02-08 at 02:04:44: in the last hour of the workday my lab mate saved me from my overthinking. she helped me *just get started* on a multi-day procedure - when previously i was gonna keep marinating on it til thursday or later. i feel great :D

2023-02-07 at 05:53:59: rice n beans and buttered spinach for dinner! first time cooking a full meal in several weeks and wow i love to cook https://t.co/ZJRGgPTPLR

2023-02-07 at 05:52:49: i’m getting back into cooking! this is a thread to document food i make 😌🥘 &amp; happy kitchen moments

2023-02-06 at 23:11:24: @zencephalon inspirational 💓 u have any advice for getting started cultivating positive emotion w metta?

2023-02-06 at 23:09:23: i be living. the days be passin

2023-02-06 at 23:09:00: it would probably heal some part of me if i brushed up on my coding… would make me feel more competent. i was recently advised to learn about data frames / relational data structures for analyzing lots of variables that could be correlated

2023-02-06 at 23:04:02: oh hehe my gpa was 3.78 or close to it. freshman fall i got a 3.55 gpa and my dad was disappointed and that hurt!!! but sophomore year i came back and got straight A’s in the spring semester. got my one and only A+ junior fall! i’ll tell u what class it was in if anyone asks

2023-02-06 at 23:01:13: i’m curious if anybody else had painful undergrads that left an imprint on them… and how’d ya recover? cuz that’s what i’m trying to do now

2023-02-06 at 23:00:39: i think for me, the emotional pain of undergrad has created some bad work habits that persist even tho i’m in a phd program now &amp; am doing work that feels more aligned w my strengths (less engineering, more science; less math, more biology, more talking to ppl)

2023-02-06 at 22:59:10: college was so much harder than high school for me. i was also in the engineering school, but never mastered math, so i always felt like i was flailing aside from a few high points. i procrastinated a ton bc the work was overwhelming &amp; didn’t feel aligned w my strengths

2023-02-06 at 22:57:08: what was your emotional experience of undergrad like? // what was your gpa?

2023-02-06 at 21:34:26: something i believe abt the psyche: excess energy without application creates anxiety!

2023-02-06 at 19:38:02: i’ve been rediscovering self-expression thru the way i dress &amp; accessorize myself! it is great fun! i’m wearing a real power fit today

2023-02-06 at 19:33:40: hoping to get my commute &amp; cooking under control in the next week or two :) one day at a time

2023-02-06 at 19:23:52: and what of that yearning to be pure? which burns fiercer each time we unearth new darkness within? how long til we find that the pureness we seek is within and ever-present?

2023-02-06 at 19:18:36: related, sigh https://t.co/4lJdtEnaaP

2023-02-06 at 19:15:44: lol i am on my commute to work can u believe i’m about to be at work lol. it’ll be nice tho i like my coworkers a lot

2023-02-06 at 19:13:43: like, it’s cool that i enjoy psytrance, less cool that it took mdma in the forest to rewire my brain into enjoying it… makes me feel a bit corrupted

2023-02-06 at 19:11:45: i feel like i need to re-experience the power of dance music in a non bay area setting

2023-02-06 at 18:44:11: although having met my partner early on is a tremendous gift, one thing we’ve realized is: i have to put more effort into developing myself as an individual, ensuring i have an identity beyond our shared identity. which benefits everyone!

2023-02-06 at 18:41:15: i initially was like :o in response to friend. i asked her, what do you think of the prediction? i would be pretty down if i got that prediction. she said it didn’t make her sad at all - she said it gave her peace, it made sense.

2023-02-06 at 18:39:17: mom got an astrology reading done for me around age ~18-19 and it said i’d meet my life partner between ages 19-21. which happened!

my friend got her romantic fortune told by a psychic: “two serious relationships &amp; a child from latter, then meet your life partner late thirties”

2023-02-06 at 18:31:55: maybe it’s my masculine side feeling super tortured w/o good relationship to work. ayurvedic practitioner felt my pulse and was surprised by pitta strength in addition to vata. he also said my masculine energy was strong but i tend to try and hide it 👀 i was like :o tru

2023-02-06 at 18:30:09: i just have 2 push through and make the slightest bit of real progress at work and i know i am going to feel So much better about life 😭😭😭

2023-02-06 at 18:23:14: i’ve just been wearing baseball caps or sun hats … normal sunglasses over my glasses when i drive &amp; sun’s in my eyes. my poor eyes deserve better than this

2023-02-06 at 18:22:04: ok it’s happening this week. after months of putting it off, i will b ordering a pair of prescription sunglasses

2023-02-06 at 18:21:14: whereas my constricted nervous system state thinks i must ride out negative feelings, do more, then feel good

2023-02-06 at 18:19:03: i know as i start leaning into positive feelings towards/within myself, i’ll naturally become more capable of doing more things

2023-02-06 at 17:56:53: feelin the desire to become more motivated &amp; happy for the benefit of those close to me

2023-02-03 at 22:36:06: where was ur first date with your partner? 🫶🏽

2023-02-03 at 22:34:09: @chaichitta hmmmm i’ve heard soaking beans before hand / cooking in hot water then discarding that water before further use… idk exactly what, but basically there might be ways to change legume prep to make ‘em more digestible &amp; less gas producing

2023-02-03 at 19:48:25: last night when stoned i came upon a memory scene i hadn’t been to in a long time. a garden, that of my dad’s colleague J and his wife C, who were like grandparents to me. their backyard was a mystical place - an arbor of flowers, stone benches and figures 🪴

2023-02-03 at 06:05:21: served mango juice to friends n they informed me it amplifies a thc high! new info to me… can def feel it

2023-02-03 at 00:42:24: yay 4 showing up. i know my body’s gonna feel so good

2023-02-03 at 00:41:55: finally attending a yoga class this evening which i missed last week (had a cold) and the week prior (stuck at work a lil too late, generally felt like life was spiraling out of control)

2023-02-02 at 18:59:55: hit rock bottom now i get to reconstruct my routine and life from the ground up :)

2023-02-02 at 18:56:57: @chercher_ai in our lab meetings if somebody prefaces their presentation with “this won’t be long” it’s treated as the gauntlet being thrown down. get ready to be asked all the possible questions ahaha

2023-02-02 at 16:13:14: yesterday evening i listened to darude sandstorm in the MRI and it was pretty great

2023-02-02 at 16:11:45: @TylerAlterman good instinct to be cautious of favoring frameworks over direct experience early on!

2023-01-28 at 23:18:07: i think this is what it means to walk with spirit

2023-01-28 at 23:12:59: recent experiences be dialing way up my openness to new experience / willingness to relinquish my vision of what’s to come, and surrender to the play and divine unfolding

2023-01-28 at 23:11:43: really fun to play around with changing my appearance / self-expression at a heavy/formative moment of life

had a ball thrifting yesterday and building an entirely new fit w versatile pieces … and now to see if some haircut magic can be worked!

2023-01-28 at 23:02:16: like the energy literally moving, pulsing in on place then another, in my heart space

i’m looking for low maintenance but chic. don’t want a haircut that involves straightening/styling (like a forehead fringe or curtain bangs in my hair)

2023-01-28 at 02:54:06: time to self-regulate by drinking some soup and then meditating

2023-01-27 at 18:57:44: life pulls you into its deep currents whenever it so pleases

2023-01-27 at 17:09:13: feeling more and more that i really am just acting out my karma in each passing moment. control is an illusion. ego-i thinks it knows what’s going on but there is so much at work beyond the perception of ego

2023-01-22 at 23:08:11: having a wonderful weekend in person with my person :) ☀️

2023-01-21 at 02:34:09: that is, if he makes his flight 😅😅😅

2023-01-21 at 02:28:24: made it through the work day (made progress on things! kept the rock moving!) and now all that’s left to do is to shower n get dolled up n pick up bf from the airport!!! 💖

2023-01-21 at 02:24:37: @cursedmargarita hell ya. cozy

2023-01-21 at 02:15:48: the other reassuring thing is that i didn’t take my supplements for like a week, week and half during a low period, and my levels are still good :D

2023-01-21 at 02:15:01: got some blood work back and for the first time maybe ever i’m not vitamin d deficient! yay for the power of consistent supplementing ☀️☀️☀️

2023-01-21 at 01:22:03: february is shaping up to be a wonderful month of seeing/hosting friends visiting from far away! “come to me” era indeed 💕 https://t.co/PbRK6r6h8h

2023-01-20 at 01:06:54: @cursedmargarita what led u to stop smoking?

2023-01-20 at 01:05:00: feelin like i should get a pair of compensatory shoes. comfy platforms that allow me to be 5’4” or even - dare to dream - 5’5”

2023-01-20 at 00:32:45: train commute home, then yoga, then i will drink warm chicken bone broth at home!

2023-01-19 at 19:59:59: evidently my subconscious doesn’t accept that i am “working” unless i’m experiencing internal tension. i couldn’t possibly be working if it feels easy!

2023-01-19 at 00:53:35: @poIypore 💕☺️ yes! and this reminds me to get you a kitchari recipe. do you have an instant pot or the like?

2023-01-18 at 22:55:13: @yokaihainen saw fennesz live several months ago in LA!

2023-01-18 at 22:43:28: @isosteph made me laugh out loud

2023-01-18 at 22:42:51: seeking recommendations for a lil lamp (probably sub $40) that provides warm light. already have a himalayan salt lamp

2023-01-18 at 22:40:51: my working theory is that experiencing chronic illness / childhood illness predisposes one to seek more physical touch reassurance &amp; regulation (more likely to have physical touch as a highly ranked love language)

2023-01-18 at 22:37:37: @eIfcup @cIass_man hi guys nice to see u on the TL i think nostalgically of coming across both of u 2+ years ago!!!

2023-01-18 at 22:27:14: i am so blessed by abundant friendship in my present life!

2023-01-18 at 22:24:57: she is the best kind of person and boy am i grateful our paths intersected

2023-01-18 at 22:19:59: love my roommate. we just (as of 1/15) hit one year of living together! she’s at work today and i just finished cleaning the kitchen and i knooow she’s gonna be so happy to come home to a tidy, nice-smelling kitchen

2023-01-18 at 21:50:57: gonna have dinner with my friend who’s super into foraging ☺️ she and a friend are going mushroom hunting in a bit and then we’ll have dinner together made with whatever they find!

2023-01-18 at 20:41:56: for real tho. i’ve lost 15+ pounds since august ‘21 due to a recurring health issue. that’s a lot to lose from my frame and i haven’t been able to gain any of it back yet

hence, bulking! 

copious butter. big portion sizes. building my sturdiness from da ground up

2023-01-18 at 20:36:07: it’s bulking szn

2023-01-18 at 18:16:14: @veggiebat_ 👀 u get me

2023-01-18 at 04:15:21: @cIass_man omg didn’t notice til now ur over 3k!

2023-01-16 at 18:57:57: @hormeze https://t.co/CCauREdqF8

2023-01-16 at 07:56:18: @christineist so how can we indirectly aim for such values?

2023-01-16 at 07:55:31: @christineist +1 i find watching youtube videos far more effective for learning recipes than reading written instructions

2023-01-16 at 03:51:46: @sokindling when i read norwegian wood, something that stuck with me &amp; provided inspiration was protagonist’s regular letter-writing habit. no need to read if not compelling - just a potential source of inspiration!

2023-01-16 at 03:09:52: gotta get back on my morning routine shit

2023-01-16 at 03:08:05: @donmexlar you are allowed to run nice n slow

2023-01-16 at 03:07:38: from a vid i watched earlier today: your job is not to know exactly how things will play out - your job is to keep showing up

2023-01-16 at 03:02:42: also entering my very literal bedroom dj era

2023-01-16 at 02:59:01: well would you look at that my problems have not in fact magically resolved themselves… looks like i have to turn towards them

2023-01-16 at 02:58:13: @donmexlar when i’m in good shape i have to run 3 miles or more at once to feel that i’ve expended enough energy!

2023-01-16 at 02:48:09: @veggiebat_ ahaha to the jugular i needed this

2023-01-16 at 02:43:04: @donmexlar one of my fav books!!! read over christmas 2021, finished on flight headed home either from or to vegas. was quiet for some moments and laid down on the empty seats beside me, and before long my whole body began to shake with sobs

2023-01-15 at 19:53:27: entering my staying at home n crafting era... my "come to me" era. have to go easy on my body while i'm trying to heal from acute health challenges

2023-01-15 at 19:49:47: @donmexlar subbed :)

2023-01-14 at 01:34:28: @embryosophy oh this is similar to a vision sri ramakrishna / vivekananda would have :o

2023-01-13 at 02:32:17: @hormeze i wouldn’t say i’m an expert but i have a shared interest

2023-01-12 at 16:52:15: @goblinodds i was in adolescence but not at all now!

2023-01-12 at 09:00:44: @zestular getting a little dissociated makes you appreciate your body more &amp; become more aware when you come back to it

2023-01-12 at 07:54:33: @margaritamaxxed i had a moment i think yesterday where i felt exactly this and considered tweeting it

2023-01-12 at 00:29:41: she tweeted whilst scribbling down notes after an exciting conversation with a potential collaborator &amp; author of a paper she’s been obsessed with… :D i &lt;3 being a scientist

2023-01-12 at 00:28:17: wow i fuckin love my life

2023-01-12 at 00:11:38: i found him and have learned a few things but he keeps ignoring me or talking over me :(

2023-01-11 at 23:18:38: i know that one way towards feeling better is countering that negative internal feeling/narrative by doing even a small thing to take care of myself/my affairs

2023-01-11 at 23:15:04: it’s not like everything has been going downhill / stagnating. in fact, recently a thing that’s looong triggered me became like, way less triggering, basically not triggering at all. something clicked into place within. fascinating to observe. i do want to be happy/optimistic tho

2023-01-11 at 23:13:38: idk why ego n subconscious have been creating a persistent negative internal feeling, sense of “doom” / cynicism about self

2023-01-11 at 23:11:03: @_ArnaudS_ would love to join if i feel up to it, getting back from weeklong conf friday

2023-01-11 at 23:08:27: gently dismantling that internal story that my life is going downhill, that i am not using my time right, that every day will continue to feel separate from the last &amp; will never add up to anything

2023-01-11 at 06:49:15: “u get loopy when u do drugs i get loopy when i ride trains”

2023-01-11 at 05:50:25: @embryosophy plans are materializing for me to experience a first cigar tomorrow 🙈

2023-01-10 at 23:16:18: lil dance and singing break in my room before going back to conference session

2023-01-10 at 23:14:56: one astrologer looked at my chart a few years ago &amp; his very first piece of advice was “speak only when absolutely necessary”. at first i was a bit miffed but i kinda get it now

2023-01-10 at 22:10:58: @petrichor_lull @ashton_mae1 mint tea good for digestion so perhaps in a roundabout way soothing for the mind

2023-01-10 at 22:07:43: @eurydicelives @hormeze vibes

2023-01-10 at 22:06:40: @eurydicelives i’m getting @donmexlar

2023-01-07 at 14:17:20: entering my cool tones era

2023-01-06 at 22:49:46: guess i’ll just have to track him/her down 😁

2023-01-06 at 22:47:08: heading to week long science conference tomorrow! the mystery &amp; fun begins - was browsing a list of posters &amp; found one directly relevant to my research interests but cannot find ANY info on the presenter!

2023-01-06 at 20:16:43: oho can’t forget about starting full moon practices. i’ve long had the desire to attune to the moon’s cycles, and now i have more information &amp; the impetus to invest energy into this (emotional pain of health flare-up). let’s turn this pain into something beautiful 💪🏽

2023-01-06 at 19:30:35: the book that’s captured my heart at present is “a tale for the time being” by ruth ozeki. it’s so good. so many vivid images and deep moments; magical realism interwoven with zen themes

2023-01-06 at 19:04:50: today:
• commute to lab
• meet with new student
• meet with advisor
• commute home
• pick up more cat food
• pick up prescription from cvs
• pack
• clean
• early bed time

2023-01-06 at 17:11:53: today’s feeling like a barely getting myself out the door kinda day

2023-01-06 at 16:19:55: @chaichitta i miss kalika…. feel like she’s been gone for 1 month+

2023-01-05 at 19:18:32: post-shower:
• moisturizing and getting dressed and makin my hair cute
• 25 min timer for fiction writing
• lunch
• unpacking &amp; cleaning
• looking at conference programme for this wknd and taking notes on titles/speakers that interest me :)
• calling home

2023-01-05 at 19:08:40: i know this isn’t ✧reality✧

the “memory spoiled” / universe’s reprimand are stories i’m attaching the events that occurred

there’s some sense i have that i deserve this health flare up

which until recently stopped me from being able to feel sympathy for myself

2023-01-05 at 19:04:51: i’m mildly pissed that my health issue had to flare up during an otherwise amazing trip with boyfriend. feels like it spoiled the memory / is the universe telling me i can’t have fun or be adventurous

2023-01-05 at 18:59:55: bruh this shower is about to be so good for my subconscious sense of freshness/cleanliness, which feeds into my overall sense of well-being

2023-01-05 at 18:35:11: we pursue self-destructive behaviors because we want to be broken open

2023-01-05 at 18:31:38: self-compassion has entered the chat

2023-01-05 at 17:31:56: @horsesxinfinite abstract answer: the more i learn about biology and the human body/human health, the more i'm struck by a sense of fractal complexity. in the face of this complexity, talking to others about experiences &amp; tidbits of knowledge often illuminates parts of the map i hadn't considered

2023-01-05 at 17:20:04: @horsesxinfinite ty &lt;3

2023-01-05 at 17:12:15: not sure why i dwell in this low vibrational state, stagnant and disconnected from god &amp; the things i enjoy

2023-01-05 at 00:18:30: i feel like my uterus is an unstable system - ready to be perturbed and sent into a chaotic state. i would like it to not feel like that 😭 https://t.co/HlOKYceKe4

2023-01-05 at 00:18:30: not to mention august and october 2021, where twice i bled super super heavily for 10 days &amp; ended up anemic 2x. all this is suspected to relate to a polyp, but who knows. there's also the matter of the hormone meds i take &amp; how they all play into this

2023-01-04 at 23:55:58: one month+ i've been chilling, no bleeding, thinking maybe this is finally over... and then on trip to death valley last weekend, on the way to badwater, i feel a sharp pain and know i've started bleeding again

2023-01-04 at 23:54:20: in late october i messed up the dosage of one of my hormone meds once and spent the first 2.5 weeks of november bleeding. then bleeding stops. and is triggered again after a camping trip where it got particularly cold. i bleed for 6 days and then it stops

2023-01-04 at 23:52:13: i've been having these abnormal menstrual bleeding episodes since 2021 (really, since 2017) and i'm wondering if i can crowdsource wisdom on how to deal

2023-01-04 at 23:50:20: i think it should be fine but i'm hoping power doesn't go out with the storm bc i need this heating pad against my lower abdomen at all times

2023-01-04 at 22:04:31: @moonboi_ dropped acid after i missed my first train on my 10 hour train-bus route from emeryville to la. got on the next train 2h later. trippin by myself in an enclosed box on wheels was not the move

2023-01-04 at 19:09:48: @nat_sharpe_ not sure how mine will translate to art but i am curious! 🤞

2023-01-04 at 06:38:46: @veggiebat_ :) https://t.co/KQKLjiife4

2023-01-04 at 06:38:14: @grantbels yes!

2023-01-04 at 04:45:49: part of my plan for a rainy day tomorrow: going through my closet &amp; assembling &amp; taking pics of 5-10 outfits i feel good in!

2023-01-04 at 01:40:39: @ulkar_aghayeva hesse’s narcissus and goldmund

2023-01-03 at 22:36:42: it’s time for lab meeting yay for lab meeting

2023-01-03 at 21:37:07: i’m feeling empowered to do this with the energy of the new year. but i don’t know exactly how to go about it. i will trust my heart to guide me &amp; i will take advice

2023-01-03 at 21:36:13: my creative instinct at present is to burrow inward towards the visions i want to create in the world. i feel inundated with others’ work (mainly crochet &amp; writing) https://t.co/00v1lyIpQy

2023-01-02 at 19:03:14: @yokaihainen u know hark the advice u gave me in mid december really helped me take action &amp; feel better about work &amp; life overall. i’m feeling optimistic about 2023! 🙏🏽 you got this 💪🏽

2023-01-02 at 19:01:33: boyf and i are being mad soothed by the vastness of these landscapes

2023-01-02 at 18:58:28: gm ☀️ https://t.co/GAEkQIMPYC

2023-01-02 at 03:25:26: @eIfcup i address formally only as much as is needed to direct / focus my mind towards communication with god

2023-01-02 at 03:02:30: of course there’s a twinge of discomfort when you fail to listen to yourself &amp; honor your desires

2023-01-02 at 01:35:57: seems high? but i could believe the majority of people are lactose intolerant

2023-01-02 at 01:34:32: someone told me recently that 80% of people are/become lactose intolerant? big if true :o

2023-01-01 at 19:45:37: @danielthedaring @inaturalist 👑🌿

2023-01-01 at 06:26:52: cracked open the peach moscato n we got daphni playing in the background of a candlelit shower

2023-01-01 at 06:20:54: having a wonderful nye evening in with bf as the storm rages outside!

2023-01-01 at 01:15:16: reunited with my love all is well

2022-12-31 at 23:07:55: @BLUNDERBUSSTED 9 hours to go over in my slice of this earth!

2022-12-31 at 14:50:37: @joshuayn514 @donmexlar i think this is intentional

2022-12-31 at 13:36:04: @captain_mrs beautiful!

2022-12-31 at 03:28:53: @chercher_ai some periods daily transitioning to once weekly

2022-12-30 at 17:17:59: first sewing project in progress. i luv learning crafts from mom

2022-12-30 at 05:52:38: entering my pinterest manifestation era

2022-12-28 at 05:27:13: @valor_zhang i’d like one if you get to it 🙏🏽

2022-12-28 at 01:32:54: crochet update: i've been obsessed with making sweaters &amp; recently finished my first one. the universe just placed 2 beautiful sweaters into my hands &amp; i'm taking this as a sign to chill out on making sweaters, and instead make smaller projects &amp; gain skills &amp; learn new stitches

2022-12-27 at 01:15:58: i sat between my parents in the prayer hall and we meditated together. it felt special. i was aware that i will not always have them with me on this plane. it made the moment more precious, and i committed it to my storehouse of memory

2022-12-27 at 01:07:47: i also asked the monk for a reading recommendation on the nature of the mind and he walked straight across the room and plucked a volume from a top shelf. start here, he said, there are smaller books i can give you in the future

2022-12-27 at 01:06:05: momma got me a rudraksha mala and asked for a monk to bless it by thakur’s feet ☺️📿

2022-12-26 at 21:20:52: i also feel increasingly cute and hawt

2022-12-26 at 21:20:11: i’m guessing 1 yr to waist length hair and i feel more powerful &amp; more connected to tradition with every inch

2022-12-26 at 16:15:51: @quistydotquist a sense of continuity is something that ebbs and flows for me, and requires some active effort to promote

2022-12-26 at 03:47:21: @veggiebat_ hehe aw. what do you usually wear in your nose piercing? studs? a lil hoop?

2022-12-26 at 03:46:49: @veggiebat_ ohhh no the eyebrow i have individual control over is my right one, so it follows left side for the piercing. but i already have 2 ear cartilage piercings only on the left ear, and god forbid i become more asymmetrical!

2022-12-26 at 03:42:34: grateful for quality time with family. words cannot express how much i love these three humans &lt;3

2022-12-26 at 03:14:41: RT @tasshinfogleman: tits or ass? bro her ability to precisely describe her inner experience

2022-12-25 at 23:22:33: @minhwrites :) favorite dishes you’ve made? anything nostalgic?

2022-12-25 at 15:54:46: if u have a side-of-nose piercing, how did you decide which side to get it on?

2022-12-25 at 11:46:59: mere minutes until i am reunited with family! 🥰

2022-12-25 at 05:17:45: @moonboi_ wow this is so orderly. so peaceful

2022-12-25 at 04:41:37: bought a perfect sweater, a lovely lil ring for roommate, and a christmas trinket for bf :) then went to a bar &amp; read &amp; crocheted &amp; socialized and now tipsy offa 2.5 beers

2022-12-24 at 23:30:24: first time in an antique mall and this is soooo fun especially now during holiday time. the friendly older bearded man who welcomed me in said there are 50 diff vendors and the best way to experience the place is to “meander” !!!

2022-12-24 at 22:41:46: i’m not *bad* for seeking novelty or pleasure

2022-12-24 at 22:41:25: the idea that we as humans have a *need* for novelty and pleasure is one that is new to me &amp; i find it empowering

2022-12-24 at 22:14:30: wow i am having the best time. i love how nothing in the arts district is taller than 1 story https://t.co/QXtf4I1MGy

2022-12-24 at 22:13:59: the abundant antique malls call too 😭

2022-12-24 at 22:12:22: and later on i think i’ll give nevada tap room a try, i heard it being recommended in the crystal shop

2022-12-24 at 22:10:54: i’m gonna try n find a nice coffee shop to plop down in for a bit and start reading the ruth ozeki book my friend recommended. so curious if it will resonate with me or grip me!

2022-12-24 at 22:03:56: i’m at the sickest crystal shop! https://t.co/PDrvHw1SCp

2022-12-24 at 21:40:58: if views stays around i’m hoping to integrate it into a feeling of awareness &amp; appreciation of the hivemind

2022-12-24 at 21:39:16: @PrinceVogel do you think more clearly in cloudy weather or sunny weather?

2022-12-24 at 21:37:44: i was planning to walk from the airport to wherever i could walk to sightsee or get some peace and quiet. but i could not escape the airport on foot haha. i came upon the tiny ground floor public transit station &amp; boarded the 108 bus not knowing exactly where it went

2022-12-24 at 21:34:30: wow i love the bus i love public transit it’s a dream for an overly frugal grad student who gets stressed when she drives

2022-12-24 at 21:31:19: manifesting a thrift shop where i can get a cheap baseball cap or pair of sunglasses to protect my eyes from the bright sunlight

2022-12-24 at 21:30:21: i have boarded a bus to the arts district!

2022-12-24 at 17:27:39: pls reply below or dm if u would be down for a call sometime today! long layover, 12.5h to go

2022-12-24 at 16:41:18: @Maria_Pea_20 oh so cute! i didn’t realize one could knit little creatures too, i thought that was a crochet thing!

2022-12-24 at 16:40:04: @valor_zhang today i will occupy myself until my 10pm flight inside and in the vicinity of the vegas airport. started a crochet project. will nap at some point. will go for a walk to UNLV

2022-12-24 at 00:35:38: i am redeemable, i am not a failure, i am fine just as i am. i take selfless action and support my well-being &amp; that of those around me :)

2022-12-24 at 00:33:00: i was feeling quite irritable and down earlier today, but now my heart is a happy little puddle &amp; i feel optimistic about my travels tomorrow &amp; my work come january! grateful for the transience of emotions :)

2022-12-23 at 23:25:20: @br___ian oh one interesting thing. my mental model of dopamine is v simple: “yes dopamine i want it all the time”, “more dopamine good”

interestingly he says the creative process has two components - divergent and convergent thinking. former happens w high dop, latter w low dop

2022-12-23 at 22:53:53: in my limited experience with circling one idea i really like &amp; think about often is that of “staying in connection” with whoever i am interacting with

2022-12-23 at 22:51:35: @hormeze gunna pick some l-theanine up today

2022-12-23 at 16:56:48: @br___ian learned a lot of facts, not a lot of fun ones 😅

2022-12-23 at 04:19:42: @MCMCD_ looks so good!

2022-12-23 at 04:16:21: @isosteph i keep getting a comcast ad whenever i’ve opened the app today aha

2022-12-23 at 03:39:14: @_StevenFan 😭😭😭 are you sure you want it

2022-12-23 at 00:09:53: finally in the right headspace to give this a listen https://t.co/DnQx3O8fki

2022-12-22 at 20:18:44: @Prigoose a noble aspiration

2022-12-22 at 20:17:48: @202accepted is vegas known for its buffets?!

2022-12-22 at 20:01:21: so uhh. what to do with a day long (~7am-9pm) layover in vegas saturday

2022-12-22 at 19:57:42: @hormeze i like it, i love a good reframe. i don’t think my comedowns are generally from dissociated states tho so i am trying to see if the reframe generalizes

2022-12-22 at 18:57:23: i long for the day when i have more deeply internalized that there is a force larger than i am

2022-12-22 at 18:53:03: i find comedowns of all sorts so hard!

2022-12-22 at 18:15:12: i got radiation therapy as a child and i believe it made my torso a lil shorter than nature’s bioelectric blueprint intended it to be

2022-12-22 at 18:14:43: sometimes i think about how my body was meant to be a little taller

2022-12-22 at 17:02:40: after i get through the day, i get to spend the evening home alone with the cats with low lighting and maybe oiling my hair

2022-12-22 at 16:41:07: @mechanical_monk @DlABLESS supports immune system too!

2022-12-22 at 05:52:55: taking an epsom salt bath to ease sore muscles and promote a sense of  bodily well-being :)

2022-12-21 at 21:44:44: passed :)

2022-12-21 at 05:33:55: getting those sweet sweet freeway miles

2022-12-21 at 04:22:30: going on a drive to get my prius thru a drive cycle so that i can pass smog check tomo

2022-12-20 at 20:01:51: nervous system, disarmed. helpful to notice that my fearful/escalatory responses to challenges stem from a state of general nervous system overactivation. i don’t need to “fix my attitude”, i need to be gentle to myself &amp; actively self-regulate

2022-12-20 at 19:12:31: is this a Dark Night of the Soul? 🦋

2022-12-20 at 18:59:59: attachment/detachment to thought is a difficult concept to understand with one’s rational mind huh

2022-12-20 at 18:56:53: all this to say i’m relieved i realized this wasn’t a big deal and that everything will be okay and that i am capable of dealing with this

2022-12-20 at 18:56:18: having problems to solve allows you to be more engaged in action, and action - “working incessantly”, in swami vivekananda’s words - is purifying, grounding if done without attachment

2022-12-20 at 18:55:06: car failed smog check, technician explained what to do and i was in a daze. inner child started to get worried. big unsolvable problem, can’t be happy until this is fixed

on drive back calming voice arose in head: it’s okay, this is a solvable problem…

2022-12-20 at 03:28:13: @AskYatharth i have heard this!

2022-12-20 at 01:57:22: @er1enney0ung you too sweet éri!

2022-12-20 at 01:50:56: @er1enney0ung strength gratitude breakthrough creation 🙏🏽✨

2022-12-20 at 01:17:19: looking to 2023, i want to feel happy and whole and gainfully engaged in my pursuits. long distance continues to weigh on my heart and subconscious, but i must do all i can to love my life as it is

2022-12-20 at 01:15:35: you know, i’m starting to feel optimistic about life after the new year. i’ve set a few things in motion now and i know where to concentrate  much of my work energy and spiritual energy

2022-12-20 at 00:31:30: no trial is wasted!

2022-12-19 at 19:33:51: @flimsyfloppus @br___ian @christineist early mid jan! don’t want to give exact dates on tl

2022-12-19 at 17:39:58: there’s one yama or niyama that’s like, “the mind has bad taste in sense pleasures. over time through the practice of this virtue or guideline, you re-train your mind to instead seek spiritual joy/bliss/identification with the infinite”

i find this reassuring &amp; inspirational

2022-12-19 at 17:16:56: ego is like “if i give in at this stage of the argument, i feel like a doormat, i feel incapable of articulating things that affect me negatively &amp; thus i must just bear these negative things”

there’s a defeatedness for sure
but this too is transient

2022-12-18 at 21:23:44: lord help me learn how to hold in my heart and mind spiritual ideals without being tortured by the angst of not being there yet

2022-12-18 at 21:12:33: i want to be a woman worthy of your love

2022-12-18 at 03:28:01: @flimsyfloppus @br___ian @christineist update for u all: galveston is happening 🙈😭🎉

2022-12-18 at 02:57:52: love people not because they please you but rather for how true they are when they interact with you

2022-12-18 at 02:57:18: you can best enjoy thinking &amp; the analytical side of the mind when you get enough time not thinking

2022-12-18 at 02:08:06: @emmalsalinas happy bday almost twin!

2022-12-18 at 01:45:41: ya girl can finally more or less do slip-stitch ribbing! took ~30 rows of 7 stitches to figure out how to regulate the yarn tension, but we made it!

2022-12-18 at 01:44:39: it was excellent. just an hour or so now until i’m reunited with my cat and my home….. can’t WAIT. but the train ride home will be nice, it’s not too late and i have a crochet project :D

2022-12-18 at 00:30:53: abt to have an amazing 48 minute flight home

2022-12-16 at 01:23:14: @eIfcup yea that makes sense

2022-12-16 at 01:14:42: @eIfcup woow

2022-12-16 at 00:38:47: @eIfcup so out of character ……. what’s going on

2022-12-16 at 00:36:39: @scrapbookhattie no idea but it’s sick that this is a thing you’ve been doing. sounds rewarding &amp; engaging

2022-12-16 at 00:20:02: 💗 https://t.co/I5Un8j0n7k

2022-12-16 at 00:19:03: i love the indian grandparent mode of showering benediction upon benediction on a grandchild. willing positive outcomes into being - or at least sending positive thought currents into reality

2022-12-16 at 00:15:17: the ripples of joy and excitement that my mother, father, and maternal grandparents reflect back to me after initiation - they give me faith

2022-12-16 at 00:13:52: today is the first birthday i’ve gotten to spend in person with bf after 3.5 years of dating :’) 💗

2022-12-15 at 07:00:19: lay initiation in the morning ☺️ have been feeling a little anxious all day but i trust the currents that brought me here

2022-12-14 at 08:46:10: hello late night tl i am up past my bedtime excited for travels tomorrow &amp; currently washing my hair

2022-12-14 at 02:56:21: first off it’s gotta have a turtleneck. we’re going for warmth n coziness. when i wear this vest i want to feel my body heat reflected back at me big time

2022-12-14 at 02:47:21: got a bunch of yellow 100% wool yarn a while ago with the intention of making a sweater, but i couldn’t find a pattern i liked that worked with the yarn. today a vision arrived in my head of that yarn as a vest. a sunshine-y yellow vest! to the drawing board! :)

2022-12-13 at 20:29:15: making some solutions rn and i fr feel like a child again 😭🥰 look how crystalline and sparkly this magnesium chloride is https://t.co/s7SOs4ddIF

2022-12-13 at 18:19:14: the last time this theme / feeling arose within me was during my august visit home. when i was with my dad at the gym there was a moment where we made eye contact and i felt i could see his essence, who he was behind his eyes, and how i was like him

2022-12-13 at 18:16:45: considering releasing this intention. the thing i have to do is dependent on experiencing high valence states relating to a specific theme/archetype. these states naturally arise but cannot be forced

2022-12-13 at 16:41:32: like i’ll be plasma cleaning some glass to coat with a solution that makes cells want to stick to the glass; i made that solution yesterday but i made it in the wrong way and so it didn’t work. cells still looked cool tho

2022-12-13 at 16:40:25: by experiment i mean i have cells and i am doing things to them and observing them under 100x magnification. this is a dramatic oversimplification, there are so many things to control for &amp; consider &amp; even just ways of doing things

2022-12-13 at 16:37:02: day 2 of doing an experiment at work &amp; i feel sooo much more confident and good in my body than i did yesterday!

2022-12-12 at 16:30:30: there she be https://t.co/wtwssAdPcS

2022-12-12 at 16:27:11: this morning i accidentally noticed the moon high in the sky, setting in the west. i think this is the first time i’ve noticed the moon being present during the morning

2022-12-12 at 03:52:31: aromatics / tomatoes / stewin’/ stewed https://t.co/2yBeRLVQpS

2022-12-12 at 02:48:45: making back to back stews to get through a big butternut squash &amp; to get into the festive spirit 🥰

2022-12-12 at 00:44:07: my creative endeavor for this evening: working on protocol for an experiment tomorrow. it is so fun to carefully lay plans &amp; think on behalf of my future self!

2022-12-11 at 23:07:01: @profeshkitten this tweet made doubly funny by your employment in wine industry

2022-12-11 at 20:46:15: i used more liquid/vegetable broth than in the recipe n smooshed the veggies a bit after pressure cooking to get a soupy texture

2022-12-11 at 20:45:35: made this stew in my instant pot fri night and finishing the last of it off now. highly recommend! it was so warm and hearty. i’ve been having rice + stew + half an avocado on top &amp; it is 🤌🏽 https://t.co/F5j2oF8zxS

2022-12-11 at 18:15:52: not me re-inventing tapasya 😂🙈 https://t.co/N1VNfDiDOG

2022-12-11 at 18:08:19: regardless i think it is so very important &amp; good that i don’t feel alone on this path

2022-12-11 at 18:07:33: some of my cannabis related self-talk is quite harsh &amp; uncharitable. grateful for bf and his role as a sounding board over time. i’m reassured that over time i will sort out my relationship to the substance (or it will be sorted out for me, in a way i cannot yet perceive)

2022-12-11 at 17:56:12: oh the bliss of remaining engaged in action

2022-12-11 at 02:06:23: @er1enney0ung https://t.co/132CwGnveC

2022-12-10 at 21:45:07: @eIfcup omg i am so glad to hear it! yay for holistic healthcare

2022-12-10 at 21:41:39: seeing a stranger’s kind eyes on the train a few afternoons ago was a warm moment that affected the rest of my commute home &amp; i’m still thinking about it

2022-12-10 at 21:30:44: @sadalsvvd one cue from yoga class for chest opening when standing or sitting - imagine your armpits are lifting. really helps me lift my chest

2022-12-10 at 05:43:30: @embryosophy @profeshkitten @nopranablem for sure! :)

2022-12-10 at 05:43:14: today i gratitude journaled 😌

2/14

2022-12-10 at 05:39:16: @profeshkitten @nopranablem i agree!

2022-12-10 at 05:25:05: @er1enney0ung if u get to it

2022-12-10 at 05:23:41: roommate has requested a pair of crochet fingerless gloves. which one do we like more aesthetically? https://t.co/LbOFyuQKFG

2022-12-09 at 19:23:33: yesterday i gratitude journaled 💗

1/14

2022-12-09 at 19:18:12: @PrinceVogel hell yeah

2022-12-09 at 19:17:31: for posterity this is the grippy state i was in. when my mind gets like this it feels like a mythological beast, head eating tail, multi-headed, hydra-like https://t.co/EyioRcOP6Z

2022-12-09 at 19:15:39: the mind *likes* to concentrate, we just forget this &amp; wonder why approaching the world with a distracted mind makes us feel terrible :)

2022-12-09 at 19:14:23: ok but note to self, the way out of ur grippy &amp; excessive thoughts was not a) reading &amp; putting more ideas into psyche or b) pouring excess thought into journaling or writing

rather, it was a concentrated mind performing ur morning routine, allowing thoughts to arise n dissolve

2022-12-09 at 19:11:04: @tasshinfogleman love this thread, your creativity never fails to surprise me!

2022-12-09 at 19:09:07: heart SO full yay for friends and high quality social interaction and good faith and hope and steadfastness

2022-12-09 at 19:04:51: this just in @br___ian next week get ur birthday wishes ready 🌊🏄‍♂️✨

2022-12-09 at 18:59:01: @embryosophy :)) thank you! it’s gonna be a good one

2022-12-09 at 18:42:45: wondering if my christian friends on here can tell me of any sermons that really made an impact on them?

2022-12-09 at 18:25:03: @nickcammarata yes yes yes. just this morning i realized i’ve been stuck in a mode for past few days where i’ve been clinging to thoughts, over-identifying with thought, and wanting all my thoughts to be ‘good’ ones (bc only then am i Good). so silly

2022-12-09 at 18:01:41: ♥️♥️♥️ https://t.co/bMWfdorfnT

2022-12-09 at 17:51:22: @laudablelies :)) 🤔😊💕

2022-12-09 at 17:16:18: crazy that you can often just articulate what you’re feeling without adding interpersonal ego to it, eg

“i’m feeling anxious about arriving later than we planned to” / “you’re changing the plans in a way i don’t like”

“i want a call :’)”/ “you don’t have time for me”

2022-12-09 at 17:07:41: wow we’re passing thru a corridor of powerful bdays (mine’s coming up next week too 👀😊)

2022-12-09 at 17:04:33: @VividVoid_ happy bday vv! best wishes for the coming year &amp; decade ♥️

2022-12-09 at 16:51:24: @christineist i watched this therapy in a nutshell video about the cortisol awakening response &amp; morning anxiety. had you heard of it? i don’t always feel cleansed, sometimes emotions carry over https://t.co/S5HavYKJEL https://t.co/2IB9aMzuRN

2022-12-09 at 16:47:29: @christineist yes! there’s a definite cleansing aspect of being reborn every day. i think that’s what gives me hope

2022-12-09 at 06:25:33: porcini pizza, a blunt, amanita, and then we’re gonna make cookie dough

2022-12-09 at 04:19:19: ehehe at friend’s apt and she’s making porcini pizza 🍕

2022-12-09 at 00:23:38: as per your worldview, why do we experience discomfort? what good comes from bearing discomfort?

2022-12-08 at 22:51:06: i’ve only read the first 100 pages of glass bead game but one thing i deeply appreciated was the depiction of angst &amp; internal turmoil even while following one’s path

2022-12-08 at 21:20:40: i love my love’s soft heart. may we remain soft-hearted

2022-12-08 at 21:05:00: @embryosophy :)) wanna get on a call sometime soon?

2022-12-08 at 20:36:27: @tasshinfogleman oh tasshin i would love to! so many things to choose from, let me see which feels like it could be interesting to you. my hope would be that i can transmit my wonder &amp; curiosity to you while explaining!

2022-12-08 at 20:28:47: @embryosophy dude we have to compare notes on membranes sometime, my work / field involves thinking about forces propagating in membranes &amp; membrane curvature &amp; how that plays into signaling

2022-12-08 at 20:07:17: the teaching on this that speaks to my heart - ‘jonomo morono’ by parvathy baul https://t.co/8nidQ7JPLg

2022-12-08 at 20:04:10: i really like the idea that we are born every morning and die every night

☀️ it brings me hope and wonder that we are reborn every morning

🌙 dying every night provides a healthy sense of urgency

curious if this idea is meaningful for you, &amp; how it appears in your daily life

2022-12-08 at 18:52:20: RT @startingfromnix: You crave everything at once, and see life as one big feast. You want both discipline and freedom, both stability and…

2022-12-08 at 18:09:36: when my internal dialogue gets messy n contradicting &amp; i instinctually qualify everything, i often reach for zen thought bc i know it has a quieting &amp; grounding effect on me

2022-12-08 at 17:26:30: @DiamonDie your “best way” is different from my “best way”

2022-12-08 at 17:03:03: my friend has a pattern she’s caught in with her parents, where there is misunderstanding &amp; distrust &amp; hurtful things are said. her conceptualization of working through this karma: becoming aware of this pattern, and learning to act outside of it

2022-12-08 at 16:59:46: one way we can perceive karma or its workings is in our interpersonal relationships. i think karma also exists in our relationships with ourselves - what things do you find particularly difficult, scary, challenging?

2022-12-08 at 16:55:27: so, despite not needing to know exactly how karma works - i’m not entirely content with the ultra abstract, detached from my experience of reality, concept of karma

so i raise you this next line of thinking

2022-12-08 at 16:52:53: this was an example that stuck with me, of revealing the essence of a thing. like, sigh of relief, “right, that’s why we’re doing this”)

2022-12-08 at 16:45:34: (i’m reminded of this youtuber i watched while setting up obsidian, he was a grad student and emphasized - yes let’s set up this tool, it’ll be great, but the *point* is not to have the best set-up, but rather to support your pursuit of knowledge &amp; understanding…

2022-12-08 at 16:43:42: but that’s the thing, the point is not to understand &amp; reveal the workings of karma to the rational mind. we don’t need to know exactly how karma works (though sometimes the idea can provide peace - in difficult times, “i am working through my karma”)

2022-12-08 at 16:32:11: through our past, present, and future lives we are tasked with working through &amp; releasing the karma we have produced

who’s to say the exact timescale it works on. i think in one life you could be affected by karma from many lives ago &amp; also from something earlier in this life

2022-12-08 at 16:28:35: and what constitutes action? a thought is an action too. thoughts send out ripples in your psyche and in collective consciousness. so thoughts seem like they generate karma too

2022-12-08 at 16:26:52: often karma is thought to be “the result of the things you do” when in truth, karma is generated when you act with attachment to the outcome; you cease to produce karma as you learn how to act without attachment, raising your effort to God

2022-12-08 at 16:24:47: book club last night got me thinkin about how we can begin to recognize interpersonal karmic patterns, and for the relationships &amp; dynamics that cause us the most grief, move towards acting without attachment

2022-12-08 at 00:11:45: @myceliummage u kno i’ve done a buncha stuff but adderall i just don’t wanna fuck with

2022-12-07 at 22:48:06: today i will begin a few full moon sadhanas!

2022-12-07 at 22:45:27: @VividVoid_ beautifully put, thank you for this vv

2022-12-07 at 22:34:18: @gptbrooke long distance being over &amp; coming home to bf’s warm body and comforting presence every night

2022-12-07 at 18:45:33: checked off every item on my grocery list 😊 now to go to the yarn store!

2022-12-07 at 01:39:52: @tasshinfogleman i think i might become the sort of person with unshakable faith in God

2022-12-07 at 01:15:34: this parallels arjuna’s dilemma at kurukshetra

2022-12-07 at 01:15:07: from gospel of matthew: for he who would save his life will lose it, but he who loses his life for my sake will find it ♥️

2022-12-07 at 00:55:28: what is it you need in order to be more grounded in your Self (that limitless, expansive thing we call Brahman or God)

2022-12-06 at 21:00:02: @TheGrandBlooms i did used to enjoy cognitive function theory tho, is that something you’re familiar with? it’s a theory that underlies/goes hand in hand with mbti

2022-12-06 at 20:57:34: @TheGrandBlooms hm it’s a good question but not one i have an immediate answer to. i don’t think adding a pair of letters would necessarily make mbti a better descriptor

2022-12-06 at 19:58:20: @TheGrandBlooms infj used to be more into it several years ago but felt that none of the descriptions fit me as well as i’d like them to

2022-12-06 at 19:37:51: i realize now that a few cues in yoga have been calling for quadricep contraction and the reciprocal hamstring lengthening

eg, in a standing forward fold with legs together or wide legged forward bend - grip knees up; open back of the thigh / push center of thigh back

2022-12-06 at 19:34:33: also came across the concept of reciprocal inhibition, which says that for muscles on one side of a joint to relax &amp; lengthen, the muscles on the other side must contract

this means: quadricep contraction accompanies hamstring lengthening

2022-12-06 at 19:10:19: so far i’ve learned that sciatic nerve tension can contribute to that sense of hamstrings being tight - and that the way to relieve nerve tension is different than muscle tension

nerves respond well to gentle stretching, they lack elasticity of muscles. hence, “nerve glides”

2022-12-06 at 19:08:13: my current project is understanding how to increase hamstring flexibility / ability of navel to contact thighs https://t.co/cgF3xRjiaX

2022-12-06 at 02:47:23: @PiquantParvenu or nothing at all! just curious

2022-12-06 at 02:45:17: @PiquantParvenu in my case, with extra estrogen intake i was prescribed progesterone to ‘oppose’ it, so that endometrium wouldn’t keep growing n growing

uncontrolled endometrial proliferation can lead to at worst endometrial cancer but realistically benign polyps

2022-12-06 at 02:43:55: @PiquantParvenu just a thought based on my experience - wondering if you’ve talked with your doctor about the risk of excess endometrial proliferation with more estrogen in your system? this may not apply in your case -

2022-12-06 at 02:41:24: hehe i may get to have two celebrations for my birthday this year :) one in LA, then the next day at home in berkeley :)

2022-12-06 at 02:32:53: and with this i refer to the idea that the left side of your body is the lunar side, and the right is the solar side. this is laid out in maya tiwari’s tremendous resource on ayurvedic healing &amp; vedic living for women, “the path of practice”

2022-12-06 at 02:31:29: the left side of my body has been energetically interesting the past few weeks. pulses in left inner thigh while meditating and after energy healing from my mom. now these new pains from regions that beg for flow of prana… i’m taking this to mean my lunar side is healing…

2022-12-06 at 02:29:38: now that i’ve been doing yoga asanas somewhat regularly for a month, my body keeps surprising me, 

with more vertebrae cracking than ever before; 

with new pains when i don’t do yoga, in my left knee and in my left inguinal ligament

2022-12-06 at 02:25:11: @touchmoonflower perusing… https://t.co/8CSRtNVgRq

2022-12-05 at 19:38:33: @er1enney0ung @strangestloop boyf got me a “she pee” for a past bday…… they exist. have i ever used it? no

2022-12-05 at 19:37:04: there is a certain secret thing i have to do before my birthday (in 10 days!), which i’ve been intending to do for the past few months. i will update below when i do it!

2022-12-05 at 18:50:44: i love dealing with the neighborhood mechanic. they’re trustworthy and kind and after every interaction i feel as though i’ve gotten a dose of healthy &amp; upstanding masculinity

2022-12-05 at 17:40:01: thinking about a march or april 2023 roadtrip pilgrimage to santa fe

2022-12-05 at 17:01:37: mmmf my heart is feeling so ready and excited for diksha and japa

2022-12-04 at 01:41:37: @hormeze feels like 4 songs in 1 song, i just love the energy. gives me all sorts of body tingles. v fun to move to https://t.co/XwaLhR2BCV

2022-12-04 at 01:37:55: @hormeze i am particularly fond of techno. i generally like dancing to house too. my introduction to electronic music was dark psytrance 😅 other stuff too! not a fan of dnb cuz i haven’t figured out how to move to it 

i’ll link a few songs i like below

2022-12-03 at 11:20:50: @petrichor_lull how did u end up with extra energy now?

2022-12-03 at 11:18:12: @petrichor_lull i'm still in "savor this state" mode when perhaps i should be in "getting body ready for sleep mode". well, as i type this i just sat in bed with a heating pad and the sleepiness is beginning to appear

2022-12-03 at 10:42:00: who’s up i have far too much energy for this time of night

2022-12-03 at 10:18:06: wouldn’t be a matilda night out without an audio tweet for y’all https://t.co/o38uv4SDHi

2022-12-03 at 01:17:32: @leahprime yessss to eudaimonia! i think this may be the first time i’ve seen it mentioned in my twittering. i came across the concept in this podcast episode a few months ago and it really struck me https://t.co/krOtIGPJum

2022-12-03 at 00:11:10: more thinking on these intertwined paths:

🔸science - refining the rational mind
🔹spirituality - recognizing limits of rational mind, also purifying the rational mind, developing the subconscious

2022-12-01 at 06:04:04: @responsiblparty i have never liked jazz, unfortunately, so it was not super enjoyable. neutral experience. i felt like i was sitting there - trapped in a seated body - and listening to psychedelic contemplation music. was with good friends though

2022-12-01 at 03:01:05: @sadalsvvd also i swear the energetic feeling of the ring is different depending on which side i wear on top (bigger stone on top/bottom)

2022-12-01 at 02:58:45: @sadalsvvd i just got a new ring too and i am obsessed! mine makes me feel powerful. how does ur ring(s) make you feel? https://t.co/qVPvM1yfqN

2022-12-01 at 02:27:58: @TheGrandBlooms :) i like to talk about the experience of training to be a scientist, hinduism, books i’m readin, all manner of thoughts and feelings as they arise

2022-12-01 at 01:23:19: @responsiblparty it was an afternoon at an outdoor venue and he jazz improvises extensively live and it was basically my first time hearing him. it was a lot

2022-12-01 at 01:19:35: @flimsyfloppus what kinda beans n what preparation

2022-12-01 at 01:19:14: @responsiblparty first time i took 2cb was at a thundercat concert. i had no idea what i was in for

2022-11-30 at 23:46:25: @flimsyfloppus oho i don’t know that specific part, could you send the verse(s)?

2022-11-30 at 23:44:09: @startingfromnix hehe i read this and i was like yes! i have this! thank u for helping me discover words for a strength i have

2022-11-30 at 23:36:12: but anyways. excited about pelvic floor awareness bc i can feel myself beginning to visualize a complex system and dayum is it satisfying

2022-11-30 at 23:34:57: @scrapbookhattie god’s gf reminds me of krishna and his milkmaids. there is a mode of krishna worship that involves thinking of as quasi romantic beloved! just thought i’d mention if of interest

2022-11-30 at 23:33:15: @TheGrandBlooms hi i think we would have fun interacting as mutuals!

2022-11-30 at 23:31:34: and let me tell you! when i explain my work, i often start with “imagine the cell as a sphere of fluid”. and that works. but it’s not a sphere at all. it’s got all sorts of microcurvature. in some cells there are accordion-like membrane RUFFLES

2022-11-30 at 23:29:35: this year i discovered that i looooove when pictures of complex things come together in my head. the first thing i felt this for was the cell. envisioning the physical reality of the cell - the composition &amp; structure of membrane, covered w dense forest of surface receptors

2022-11-30 at 23:25:19: yesterday i became aware of my pelvic floor for the first time ever and i can’t wait to develop my understanding by looking at diagrams and experimenting with exercises and, above all, leaning into my own awareness

2022-11-30 at 23:23:19: @scrapbookhattie honestly ya. i’m a fan of any conceptualization of god that allows for personalization of god. cuz that’s what u need to have!

2022-11-30 at 23:19:07: RT @scrapbookhattie: im gods girlfriend

2022-11-30 at 22:59:45: safe way to get ur novelty kicks - extend ur normal neighborhood walk or running route by a few streets. providing the eyes and all the senses something fresh to perceive

2022-11-30 at 22:53:43: methinks a scalp massage and braiding my hair when i get home after my walk

2022-11-30 at 22:50:09: @startingfromnix this is sooo cool! it really spoke to me. i just read something that feels similar - about shakti-prana or feminine life force, and how to live our lives to be most in touch with that force

on a walk now but will share a page or two when back!

2022-11-30 at 22:44:28: when u are on a walk u can stop in whichever patch of sunlight you’re caught in and just stay there for however long u like soaking it in

2022-11-30 at 22:41:44: shortly i’ll be to the end of my current combustible cannabis supply, save for the remnants of a “fatboy” joint filled with a strain called “devil’s spit”

2022-11-30 at 19:23:43: @nickcammarata i have not, thanks for rec

2022-11-30 at 01:19:25: @relic_radiation 🔥 duly noted! hope to visit your neck of the woods someday

2022-11-30 at 01:02:17: @AdamInProgress would love to talk more about experiences meditating with cannabis

2022-11-30 at 01:01:26: @AdamInProgress screenshot of how i felt then https://t.co/3J7INbevEM

2022-11-30 at 01:00:05: @AdamInProgress eventually ego reasserted itself for me too and i’ve been exploring how to re enter that state of everyday existing again

2022-11-30 at 00:58:57: @AdamInProgress this lasted for weeks and was triggered by a number of things, one of which was reading an explanation of the ego (in a ram dass book) that clicked at a deeper level

2022-11-30 at 00:58:02: @AdamInProgress interesting to hear this description, echoes an experience i had earlier this year - not with feeling prana or vayus but rather i was able to identify the ego level of my experience. suddenly a lot of negative ideation just fell away and life became far more easeful

2022-11-30 at 00:56:22: @AdamInProgress so cool! how were you exposed to the thing that rang true at a deep level?

2022-11-30 at 00:54:50: @wordvoid i’ve been turned a little off of psychedelics as of late (did a lot of them in 2021) but it’s helpful to hear of circumstances where they support spiritual growth

2022-11-30 at 00:52:19: @wordvoid vvv cool. “once you seefeel, it becames identifiable in other ways” rings true for me

2022-11-30 at 00:48:01: @minobenjo 🙏🏽 yes! thank you for these words

2022-11-30 at 00:46:03: @BillyBuffington @RomeoStevens76 wow, noted! would’ve never thought of 5meo for this purpose. haven’t tried it

2022-11-30 at 00:44:59: @stefantking thank you for this empirical information! heartening as i begin to establish an asana practice. are there specific energy flows (eg vayus) you recall feeling / do you remember circumstances in which the feeling arose?

2022-11-30 at 00:42:45: @neuralkn0t thank u for empirical information :) curious about your everyday experience of energy flows - and if this experience (everyday or 💊) falls within a specific framework (qi? body meridians? etc etc)

2022-11-30 at 00:33:18: @MeghanCarron actively working on establishing such a practice in my life :) started taking iyengar classes a few weeks ago. out of curiosity, do you have a regular yoga practice &amp; if so 1) what kind, and 2) what is your awareness of prana/energy flows like?

2022-11-30 at 00:31:44: @LizNix thank you for your input :)

2022-11-30 at 00:31:04: @LizNix i haven’t tried sensory deprivation; and i haven’t been practicing all that long. i take comfort in the motion that “you know it when you feel it”. similar to some herbal healing i’m undertaking. i’ll know it’s working at some point down the line, because i’ll feel it

2022-11-30 at 00:28:02: @dancinghorse16 very cool, thanks for the empirical information :)

2022-11-30 at 00:26:06: @gmamoon888 what, specifically, did you feel, and has your awareness of energy flows expanded since then?

2022-11-30 at 00:25:34: @gmamoon888 i believe it! a friend of mine did a goenka retreat and described how each day involved attuning to progressively more subtle sensations

2022-11-30 at 00:24:24: @zencephalon i feel a little resistance to incorporating a qi gong practice into my life as i’m actively working on developing a yoga practice and it feels like maybe too much at once. but can’t hurt to try :)

2022-11-30 at 00:23:12: @zencephalon very cool, thank you for pointing me in the direction of eight silk brocades! (often a keyword can be tremendously helpful)

2022-11-30 at 00:13:21: @wholebodyprayer ♥️♥️♥️🔥

2022-11-29 at 23:26:05: @relic_radiation vvv interesting. curious how this aspect of the working theory came into being?

2022-11-29 at 23:25:22: @relic_radiation i can’t immediately think of anything but will reflect on it &amp; observe. i appreciate the ‘using the big sensations as a doorway to notice the smaller ones’ idea, it seems like a more accessible way in

2022-11-29 at 23:08:47: @wholebodyprayer i am taking an initiation in a few weeks and looking forward to any form of shaktipat transpiring, though i don’t know what to expect. perhaps that is the fun of it

2022-11-29 at 23:06:50: @wholebodyprayer fascinating! i’m particularly interested in perspectives from your cosmos as hinduism is my path. i’ve seen the term shaktipat but as always illuminating to hear your description

2022-11-29 at 19:08:52: can’t deny there’s a part of me that wants to learn how to do this https://t.co/BHDCpOvszc

2022-11-29 at 17:18:05: the bright side of having abysmally tight hamstrings is that any pose i stay in long enough to open them up a bit makes them feel amazing upon release - literally a magical surge of openness and sparkling in my legs

2022-11-29 at 05:31:43: @responsiblparty wild that this exists, thank you for linking. have you gone thru it?

2022-11-29 at 05:05:52: @FractalAuth you too!

2022-11-29 at 05:02:16: tagging people who i think would have interesting &amp; illuminating thoughts on this: @kbala444 @relic_radiation @embryosophy @responsiblparty @AdamInProgress @tasshinfogleman @nopranablem @sadalsvvd @nickcammarata

2022-11-29 at 04:56:00: my working model has been something like “you meditate enough and become attuned to subtle body things enough (thru yoga, bodywork, etc) and then eventually u become aware of these flows”. but i’m not convinced and imagine there must be better models out there

2022-11-29 at 04:54:05: so real talk, how does one begin to notice &amp; directly experience energy flows in the body? e.g. flows of prana or qi, as depicted in images https://t.co/zgU0P8KTaZ

2022-11-29 at 04:40:56: thinking about line from a book - sadhana is about learning to love planting the seed as much if not more than reaping what you sow

2022-11-29 at 01:51:11: 2 cont’d) 
but if i had a lil more weight on me, body would feel hunger n be like o i got stores i’m chilling i can handle this

2022-11-29 at 01:50:30: i think gaining weight would:

1) help me feel less cold
2) affect the way hunger sits in my body. i hypothesize that since i’m ~skinny, when i get hungry my body panics &amp; i get headache etc, and this is it’s like “ahh no more energy! neeeed fooood”

2022-11-29 at 01:46:35: for the first time in my life i have the desire to try and gain some amount of weight. maybe 10-20 pounds. i have no idea how to go about doing this 😅 i typically eat v simple ayurvedic food, and exercise regularly w yoga and running

2022-11-29 at 01:38:50: @embryosophy n anyone else w experience?

2022-11-29 at 01:38:24: sooo how would one hypothetically go about starting to learn sanskrit / dev nagari

2022-11-29 at 01:37:22: writing out my plans for rest of evening, somehow the thing i need to do *most* (science work) is the one i remember last. clear sign my psyche is avoiding it. delightful to notice ways in which māyā shrouds experience of reality

2022-11-29 at 01:26:30: @noampomsky reminds me of murakami in what i talk abt when i talk abt running. how he transitions from jazz bar late hours phase of life to countryside life which is optimal for supporting novel writing. which could be interpreted as boring

2022-11-28 at 23:42:40: about to drop $$$ on yoga props

2022-11-28 at 21:52:18: u gotta stop grasping “i need to do xyz” and shift that energy into the doing of the thing

2022-11-28 at 20:54:52: i am cautiously optimistic. i know i just have to put a little time and thinking into it each day, and eventually i will be pleasantly enraptured by the subject matter. and that rapture &amp; love &amp; curiosity will move me forward in the way i am currently unable to move

2022-11-28 at 20:30:53: i have some accumulated dread and fear and a part of me that feels like i’m a failure, to contend with :’)

2022-11-28 at 20:26:11: this afternoon i will be getting back into thinking about my science work for the first time in weeks 🙈

2022-11-28 at 20:24:37: my humbled heart trundles forward at the natural pace of life

2022-11-28 at 20:22:40: in response to that paralyzing anxiety, that stagnant energy that fears that i will never be happy, productive, in flow - to that i say that all i must do is to do what must be done

2022-11-28 at 16:17:36: body is not strong enough at present to go for runs. i miss running! haven’t been able to since end of oct

2022-11-28 at 04:31:25: life becomes engaging and absorbing as you find things to devote yourself to

2022-11-28 at 04:30:50: i forget that often all you have to do is to take the first step and then the universe will help you along

2022-11-21 at 23:42:48: twitter is my platform for sharing and reading those nuggets of insight derived from spelunking into one’s inner depths

2022-11-21 at 23:39:51: sometimes lists of tasks are exactly what i need. like a checklist written the night before, of things to do before an early departure. but today i was lacking in momentum &amp; my list of tasks wasn’t getting me anywhere

2022-11-21 at 23:38:43: turns out following the directive “getting myself physically and emotionally ready for my family’s arrival tomorrow” is far more useful and motivating than a list of tasks

2022-11-21 at 19:08:58: @jacasiegel beautiful photos! the tenderness and love in your relationship is evident 🥰

2022-11-17 at 04:40:59: okay now for real. a little meditation first, to clear my channel. thanks for your patience!

2022-11-16 at 22:42:08: beautiful piece https://t.co/xB5pTkqzaw

2022-11-16 at 19:27:03: @FractalAuth :) i’m preparing to take a spiritual initiation which will mean i’ll be under the guidance of a teacher. i am so excited! i oscillate between feeling ready and not ready but i do feel dharmically aligned

2022-11-16 at 19:25:25: i have to internalize that eating sugar generally doesn’t make me feel good 😤 i ate just under 1/4 cup of ice cream last night and got a headache. the night prior i had a “digestive” biscuit with tea and got a milder headache

2022-11-16 at 18:23:27: perhaps we will have to be more proactively pro-social. which i know we can do 💪🏽

2022-11-16 at 18:23:14: perhaps the custom of going to your friends’ profiles every once in a while, scrolling and catching up and liking a whole series of tweets - will become more important too

2022-11-16 at 18:11:04: acts of service is a love language i love to give but altho i appreciate receiving it it isn’t my #1. it’s like my number #4 lol.

2022-11-16 at 18:05:59: ok lol 2 years later i’m down for everything except for roller blading and modern dance. i don’t feel like i need to do either in this lifetime ahaha

2022-11-16 at 18:04:57: some fun ideas about the engaging the body in asanas i’ve heard in this first 1.5 weeks of classes:

• widening your collarbone as your shoulders draw back and down
• engaging the legs by drawing the thighs back and the buttocks in - learning how to do both at the same time

2022-11-16 at 18:01:24: RT @lilaexpt: so many things i want to try with this body — roller blading, yin yoga, tai chi, modern dance, belly dancing, running barefoo…

2022-11-16 at 17:24:04: earlier on in my spiritual journey i longed for unshakeable faith in God and i thought that this was trivial. turns out it isn’t - even my spiritual idols, like swami vivekananda - doubted along the way

2022-11-16 at 05:26:02: @____keh all r lovely, especially love warm expansive grandma vibes from straw hat one :’)

2022-11-16 at 03:05:26: if you’re into swami vivekananda pls let me know, i’m reading a biography of his rn and really enjoying it!!!

2022-11-16 at 03:04:06: gonna get to these after dinner! :)

2022-11-16 at 03:02:46: new mental tool in my toolbox: labeling “i’m thinking about x” as a way to stop contributing mental energy to ruminations about x is so frickin useful

2022-11-16 at 02:39:50: co-regulating with nature &amp; the season by going for a walk after a day spent mostly inside

2022-11-16 at 02:15:14: 700 follower special part 2 ☀️

reply for a passage of a book from my home, let’s see if i’m guided to anything of serendipitous interest for you :)

inspired by @sadalsvvd 🪐

2022-11-16 at 02:10:25: @minhwrites so good! v relatable - esp not too much sweet &amp; not scrolling phone first thing in morning (creates so much mental clutter!). curious if there’s a specific time(s) of day you end up having calls w family/close friends?

2022-11-16 at 02:06:19: 700 hundred followers! thank you for being here :)

been meaning to do this for a while: if we aren’t mutuals but you think we could be great mutuals pls drop a reply below to serve as a conversation starter!

2022-11-16 at 01:46:53: grateful for these next two weeks with minimal work &amp; commuting: to rest, to tune into and learn what promotes my well-being, &amp; to re-establish my enjoyment of cooking and feeding myself

2022-11-16 at 01:42:26: • what do you like for building yourself up if you’re weak or ill? 
• what do you like to make when you’re depressed or otherwise down?
• what dish do you know will create a feeling of warm &amp; well-being within you?

2022-11-16 at 01:41:00: would love ur favorite comfort recipes 🥘🍜🍚

2022-11-15 at 17:33:24: i started taking kanchanar gugglu tablets 2x/day about 2 weeks ago. i sometimes notice that my energetic body feels like it’s tingling after taking this herb. i feel it most in my cheeks &amp; forehead, and around my solar plexus

2022-11-15 at 17:13:37: what albums will you play again and again for your children, so that they may become part of the fabric of who they are? https://t.co/yEHPdv3qIE

2022-11-15 at 17:07:11: ravi shankar’s chants of india was an cd my parents played again and again in the car when i was young. i rediscovered the album recently and i feel both its spiritual power and its ability to transport me to being 5 years old in the back seat of a dodge caravan

2022-11-15 at 03:58:10: boyf n i watching trois couleurs blanc and it is 🔥 so far

2022-11-15 at 01:10:46: currently properly cleaning my room for the first time in a ~week. boy does it feel good to deal with my mess!

2022-11-14 at 22:58:26: the afterglow lasted for a few weeks. sometimes even as i go about my life now i feel i’m only just integrating some of the lessons from that first trip. lessons that can only be integrated through daily living

2022-11-14 at 22:56:53: two years ago today i dropped acid for the first time. i journaled 25 pages, experienced mind and body as separate entities in divine play with one another, saw and spoke to my higher self looking down lovingly at me on this plane

2022-11-14 at 06:58:15: @isosteph if anyone can bring about such a paradigm shift it’s you

2022-11-14 at 06:56:57: tomorrow may be the day i finally finish my first crochet sweater!

2022-11-14 at 04:09:49: @danielthedaring what kinda trees? 🌳🌳🌳

2022-11-13 at 21:02:13: cleaning my car on a sunny sunday while lunch is being made in the instant pot ☀️

2022-11-13 at 17:53:58: @durdfarm which one will you peruse first?

2022-11-13 at 17:46:06: @durdfarm wowww all so niche and relevant!

2022-11-13 at 07:04:03: @responsiblparty aw

2022-11-13 at 05:19:30: @nopranablem aw great to hear! i’ve been experiencing a similar positive effect of physical activity - yoga in my case

2022-11-13 at 04:56:16: hi friends, how’s your spirit this fine saturday night/sunday morning?

2022-11-13 at 03:20:03: @br___ian excellent tweet

2022-11-13 at 03:19:46: @br___ian bruh

2022-11-13 at 03:19:15: food is medicine

2022-11-12 at 21:22:02: making myself a nourishing lunch after a wonderful mid-morning yoga class :)

2022-11-11 at 20:02:23: @relic_radiation kool! i was just curious &amp; wanted to probe a little

2022-11-11 at 04:02:54: @valor_zhang i went to a yoga class that was very gentle and mostly seniors, and got to spend time in relaxing and supported poses

2022-11-11 at 03:45:16: it seems to me that if we don’t pay for blue our tweets will progressively get less exposure. perhaps lists will become even more important?

2022-11-11 at 03:25:43: whenever my relationship to food/cooking is out of whack, the first step is always finding a way to rekindle enjoyment of eating/cooking

2022-11-11 at 03:18:03: my evening project: cleaning and organizing our pantry shelf 💪🏽🥑🍋🥥🥔🍯

2022-11-11 at 03:13:17: this one grew on me - feels like rhythmic white noise https://t.co/IXlWMtCWr3

2022-11-11 at 03:04:57: it is comical how much easier it is to do things once i have satiated hunger. my experience of reality is warmer, the voice/sentiment in my mind more pleasant

2022-11-11 at 03:00:44: imagine tripping with a good friend and u guys do yoga and get into your respective flows and feed off of each other’s energies... 😌🥰

2022-11-11 at 02:59:41: can’t wait til i can hang out with a friend n we can do yoga together

2022-11-11 at 02:30:21: @wholebodyprayer happy birthday! i love when your tweets appear on my timeline. your insights light up my experience of the world. your words feel like distillations of experience and wisdom. :)

2022-11-11 at 02:22:21: tinctures vs teas: which one, administered over time, causes greater effect / build up of a given herb in the body?

2022-11-10 at 18:13:04: scared of being labeled as a difficult patient, scared of them not being receptive, frustrated that i have to do this in the first place

2022-11-10 at 18:02:49: about to call obgyn’s office and advocate for the care i need

2022-11-10 at 07:35:19: @quistydotquist not a thread yet but a first tweet in this direction! https://t.co/LKSs8YD4bz

2022-11-10 at 07:21:56: drank red clover blossom tea today and noticed a headache-like feeling a few sips in - not painful, but more energy in the head - and i also felt my heart racing. i don’t think i’ve had such a noticeable reaction to an herb before!

2022-11-09 at 17:50:44: gonna drink a comforting warm beverage and read about holy mother and then meditate and shower and then call my parents and then i get to meet a friend at our favorite neighborhood coffee place. life isn’t so bad after all huh

2022-11-09 at 17:49:38: nervous system be like 📈👹

2022-11-09 at 17:49:22: it isn’t even 10am and i got myself all worked up in an interaction with a friend. cooling down now, or at least trying to

2022-11-08 at 19:07:53: @goblinodds oh YES

2022-11-08 at 03:42:43: @sadalsvvd guess it’s time to download my metadata and get contact info for people i’ll miss

2022-11-08 at 03:13:46: @sadalsvvd scared that this special place will cease to exist

2022-11-08 at 03:13:28: @sadalsvvd the prospect of making this app fully paid / all the chaos that’s going on since his takeover makes me sad :(

2022-11-08 at 02:24:11: @GoddammitBaz oatmeal!!!

2022-11-07 at 22:44:22: last time i had a significant spiritual/psychological breakthrough was in july of this year - and it profoundly changed my experience of the world for a good 6 weeks. i feel another breakthrough coming on

2022-11-07 at 22:33:45: @Childermass4 aw you are human and that is okay. i feel that seasonal dread creeping up in my spirit too, but with it my resolve  strengthens to get cozy and find ways to enjoy the season ❄️🎄

2022-11-07 at 22:31:25: i would wear the hell out of anything that said “i &lt;3 oatmeal” or “i &lt;3 quinoa”

2022-11-07 at 22:27:30: @umbersorrow :)))

2022-11-07 at 22:13:15: i love getting on twitter n hanging out with my spiritual friends. y’all are truly immeasurably important to me

2022-11-07 at 22:12:38: takeaways from recent health/emotional lows:
- strengthened resolve to seek &amp; nurture high quality friendships with people who have similar values
- desire to center in gratitude always. gratitude makes you happier
- aim for small wins. one day at a time

2022-11-07 at 22:07:11: grateful for the miracle of existence

2022-11-07 at 19:08:33: first class this morning, it was sooo good. my body feels different. the teacher was so kind and gracious. feeling good about this first step on my yoga journey

2022-11-06 at 22:04:25: if you work, what’s your answer - how many hours of work can you consistently do while maintaining good health? https://t.co/jFQTlr6dQX

2022-11-06 at 02:17:22: @quotidiania hehe it’s fun to be needlessly inflammatory sometimes tho

2022-11-06 at 02:17:07: @quotidiania i’m not sure! maybe?

2022-11-06 at 02:08:04: @quotidiania maybe a use case for circle? (idk tho i haven’t figured out how to use mine)

2022-11-06 at 02:07:35: why does this go SO hard. excellent music for shaking the stress and anxious energy out of one’s body https://t.co/Ql7j2D84vr

2022-11-06 at 02:00:42: i have a disproportionate amount of nostalgia for may and june 2020 spent in my one bedroom apartment in baltimore. it was so green, so humid, and i had no idea how life was about to unfold (marvelously)!

2022-11-06 at 01:29:49: @pratibimbana do you have a spinny thing that winds your yarn as you frog?

2022-11-06 at 01:29:05: @br___ian a fun juxtaposition: reminding myself “discomfort is spiritually good to bear”, and also “i have the agency to take action to make myself feel better”

2022-11-06 at 01:22:26: i think this project will be the first one i’ll post on a second instagram account for creative pursuits. will be nice to look back on &amp; will enable me to start testing other people’s patterns! (people often look to see if you have a portfolio/audience)

2022-11-06 at 01:18:42: i couldn’t help but have a little gratitude cry. sometimes things feel divinely placed. maybe i’ll be able to go and start learning as soon as this coming week!

2022-11-06 at 01:17:10: discovered today that there is a really solid yoga studio within easy walking distance of my home. i’m so excited!!! they seem grounded in the spiritual side of yoga too - big thing for me https://t.co/WsjdvVFjiE

2022-11-06 at 01:09:21: the vision for this beanie came together as i sorted through some scrap wool i got from the thrift store a while ago. it’s gonna be so cute!! https://t.co/KjhDX2lDke

2022-11-05 at 22:40:48: finally caught up on love is blind, just got to nancy and bartise’s wedding. please please PLEASE let one of them say no

2022-11-05 at 19:25:48: @PiquantParvenu may your energy find wonderful applications :)

2022-11-05 at 19:23:25: ordered this at the recommendation of someone i trust, very excited to get into it https://t.co/pdgWsMH18A

2022-11-05 at 16:29:51: @quotidiania @forshaper 2) like ray said, saturate hair and scalp with oil. don’t go crazy, it doesn’t take that much oil to saturate. you can leave in for 1h up to overnight (put a towel on your pillow to avoid oil stains). then wash out w shampoo (may need to use a lil extra)

2022-11-05 at 16:28:25: @quotidiania @forshaper i use coconut or sesame oil for my hair. two modes of using - 1) get a little bit onto hands, apply to scalp &amp; hair, comb through hair to distribute. this helps when my hair is a little bit too dry. i add whenever i feel like i need it, can be multiple times in between washes

2022-11-05 at 06:27:56: want baked brie

2022-11-05 at 04:39:05: i’m grateful that psychedelics can help people close to death make peace with it

2022-11-04 at 23:59:04: @br___ian @responsiblparty instagram started showing me content from a barefoot shoe account and i was very down for it. now i can’t stop squinting at normal shoes and thinking about the way they suppress natural toe splay

2022-11-04 at 18:44:01: feelin inspired by @quotidiania’s guitar thread and @nowtheo’s meditationstuff thread

2022-11-04 at 18:42:53: thinkin of livetweeting some of my hobby pursuits. eg crochet sweater project (trust me it’s about to get real exciting), learning how to use my korg minilogue, learning how to use my brand spanking new dj controller :’)

2022-11-04 at 18:39:42: @responsiblparty :)

2022-11-04 at 18:38:57: @responsiblparty i try not to get too specific on the TL but i’m a biologist/baby biophysicist working with mammalian cells

2022-11-04 at 18:37:51: @responsiblparty thank u for asking 🥺

2022-11-04 at 18:37:32: @responsiblparty yeah i haven’t talked extensively with them about feedback. one thing was i felt like i had to say “i don’t know” a lot, which isn’t a bad thing per se. one lab mate cautioned me that a better approach going forward would be to give my best guess

2022-11-04 at 18:35:18: @responsiblparty i also was hoping that afterward i’d feel a release, like that post-exam euphoria in undergrad. i didn’t. my lab mates empathized. they said the difference now is that i can’t just forget everything i learned - i have to fixate on it for the next ~4 years 😅

2022-11-04 at 18:33:16: @responsiblparty my advisor was satisfied and said he was impressed with the degree to which my presentation engaged the audience

2022-11-04 at 18:32:32: @responsiblparty it went fairly well, or as well as it could have gone. i didn’t feel like i killed it, but i did what i needed to do. (i spoke to my dad afterwards and he insisted i should be able to tell myself it was good)

2022-11-04 at 18:30:58: this afternoon’s meeting with my advisor will be an interesting one. planning to mention the health issues i’ve been dealing with &amp; also ask how previous mentees of his have dealt with long distance relationships

2022-11-03 at 21:11:52: if anyone has perspectives they think could help, i will gladly take them. eg is there a bright side to feeling this weighty sadness?

2022-11-03 at 21:07:54: i am feeling big weighty sad, hopeless, dread today, and i believe this is at least in part bc of some hormonal issues. it’s not obvious to me what to do to feel better. riding the wave for now

2022-11-03 at 20:07:51: looks like it’s raining this weekend... perfect weather to stay in and work on my sweater project

2022-11-03 at 02:30:44: in a virtual book club with a bunch of canadians and their voices with their round o’s are so comforting

2022-11-03 at 01:09:29: evidently your digestive agni rises and sets with the sun

2022-11-03 at 00:10:15: the body is a black box. conventional medicine and traditional/holistic medicine each provide a toolbox of knowledge and treatment. both are paths towards insight about our bodies

2022-11-01 at 19:31:31: RT @responsiblparty: is your mind rapt or wrapped?

2022-11-01 at 19:24:55: @FractalAuth @myceliummage i think the message comes thru and i am in full agreement

2022-11-01 at 19:10:53: you can only run on fumes for so long

2022-11-01 at 19:10:00: blessed am i to be on this journey of creating a spiritually sustainable life

2022-11-01 at 17:57:19: @zencephalon thank you sweet zencephalon!

2022-11-01 at 17:57:04: @responsiblparty ☺️😭 thank you!! in the final stretch of preparing now

2022-11-01 at 15:41:12: i’ve been preparing for this for the past almost 2 weeks and i feel strongly i just want to do my group right. explain things well, bring them along this intellectual journey

2022-11-01 at 15:11:37: today’s the big day! :’) i’m giving lab meeting today. 1.5-2 hours of presenting my ideas in front of the group

2022-11-01 at 04:20:17: sometimes i speak or send off a message and i can feel the warm reverberations of the words in my heart space

2022-11-01 at 01:43:00: @quistydotquist ahhh. may there be many more days like this

2022-11-01 at 01:06:27: could i have a glimpse into your heart?

2022-11-01 at 00:59:50: @hormeze sublime, thank you for sharing. i wasn’t aware of this album! the last song is bringing me back to myself - i ended an essay i wrote two years ago with lyrics from “my god is real”

2022-11-01 at 00:31:24: can’t go wrong with ravi shankar to start

2022-10-31 at 23:59:23: @BenRatkaj i’ve only ordered when i have credits or when i want to order a special something for long distance partner

2022-10-31 at 23:58:42: i wonder what it is about hitting “rock bottom” or a local minima that shakes you up and makes you wonder about who you really wanna be

2022-10-31 at 23:23:15: every health crisis i weather takes me through tremendous pain, fear, and uncertainty. it’s all worthwhile so long as i can use what i learn to help others exist more peacefully in their bodies - pain, blood, uncertainty, mortality and all

2022-10-31 at 17:25:26: @er1enney0ung 28/29

2022-10-28 at 23:46:32: @btohtoh sometimes feeling empty is a result of becoming numb. a way out is to find safe ways of feeling things again

2022-10-28 at 16:51:27: feeling called to deepen my knowledge of yoga asanas!

2022-10-28 at 16:43:59: it takes at least 15 minutes to make my oatmeal each morning. 15 perfect minutes for stretching, doing dishes, dancing, reading spiritual texts. whatever i can do to be with myself and tend to my body and spirit

2022-10-28 at 16:08:32: @smallkewlhuman praying for his health. sending a big hug over to you

2022-10-28 at 07:26:23: im so sleepy im almost delirious. its kinda nice tho. i feel spent in a good way

2022-10-28 at 07:25:59: it's starting to come together !!! in the morning we tackle the part of the presentation where i set up specific open questions in the field &amp; some inclinations of ways of approaching 'em

2022-10-28 at 04:06:19: there’s an endless number of herbs i’m curious about. recently: red clover blossom, tulsi, mugwort. some i imagine you’d be able to feel upon one ingestion, maybe some need more. perhaps some people are by nature more attuned to the energy of specific herbs

2022-10-28 at 04:03:38: anyone wanna hang out n imbibe various herbs, primarily in tea format, and then we meditate and afterwards articulate the impressions we have of the herb’s effect on our subtle and physical bodies?

2022-10-28 at 03:39:06: yea i’m alive but wow has the past week of living felt like WORK

2022-10-28 at 03:31:15: big presentation at work next week. i’m realizing it feels super puzzle-like to get my thinking &amp; slides together. it’s not working to put the slides together beginning to end - all i can do is integrate each new idea, each new relevant paper, one by one, into the broader whole

2022-10-27 at 18:07:57: to be clear i do not listen exclusively to synthwave

2022-10-27 at 17:54:49: i’m so excited to reflect on 2022 at the end of this year! i wanted to do the same for 2021, but let the moment pass. you guys have any favorite end-of-year practices or prompts for reflection?

2022-10-27 at 17:50:34: giving my discover weekly a listen, i’ve gotten four consecutive synthwave songs ahaha

2022-10-27 at 17:34:05: i treasure the tubes of lipstick my mom has gotten for me over the years. palladio’s coffee bean is an eternal favorite

2022-10-26 at 22:10:00: making this tonight for dinner with friend who just got back from 6 weeks away ^-^ https://t.co/8YRvHVht17

2022-10-26 at 17:35:45: RT @RomeoStevens76: @lilaexpt How I sleep knowing I get to eat a big bowl of oatmeal in the morning https://t.co/U3cIsa7Lxc

2022-10-26 at 17:35:15: @RomeoStevens76 😭👏🏽 you get it!

2022-10-26 at 16:37:07: re-sharing a piece on morning routines :) i need the reminder, and maybe so do you https://t.co/pUntzVBiDR

2022-10-26 at 16:34:13: can’t believe i get to wake up every morning and eat oatmeal

2022-10-26 at 16:25:42: my inner state has been all sorts of stirred up monday through today... i haven’t been sensitive to eclipses before, but i’m beginning to wonder:::

2022-10-26 at 16:23:38: two states of mind i’m noticing:

(1) sometimes i experience a deep sense of understanding of the purposes of doing things, and it’s effortless, even self-evident. 
(2) other times i question and distrust every decision i make

2022-10-26 at 00:16:21: i wish to be in love with life and its current even when things aren’t going well

2022-10-25 at 02:46:30: moments https://t.co/uErCRMRuBa

2022-10-25 at 01:47:54: stoked to see @_rbeny tonight :)

2022-10-24 at 20:16:49: two layer lunch (there’s sauerkraut under the egg) https://t.co/WYiDCXYILa

2022-10-24 at 17:04:53: feels like this diwali is one of the most enjoyable ones in a long time, in big part because i’m finally comfortable identifying as a hindu :)

2022-10-24 at 16:55:42: ok the plan for my meeting with advisor this afternoon is that there is no plan. i’ll show up with all these ideas and rabbitholes i’ve been pursuing and he will add on to them, rule some out, and point me in new directions

2022-10-24 at 04:47:20: jai ma 🌸🙏🏽🪔 https://t.co/mhGcaKi4aK

2022-10-24 at 04:06:08: @christineist going for a walk and praying out loud; cooking a meal; journaling; running

2022-10-23 at 20:40:44: i decided to listen to my body over the rising tide of thoughts, and as soon as my mind quietened my body spoke shyly and asked if we couldn’t go outside and get some sunshine on our skin

2022-10-23 at 20:16:46: hope i figure it out eventually

2022-10-23 at 20:16:04: currently reconciling santosha (explanation in picture) with sense of “i am not the one in control / i can try and create preconditions for success but life will unfold as it will, perhaps as karmically determined” https://t.co/e8rr1Z6hHo

2022-10-23 at 18:20:30: just sent it with a heartfelt little message ☺️🥰

2022-10-23 at 17:56:36: @tasshinfogleman supa curious

2022-10-23 at 17:44:05: the energetic trace of the food i feel in my body is also just nicer than usual. texture of sprouted grain bread is too damn good!

2022-10-23 at 17:42:40: the energy transfer from the food to my body is just way more rapid. first two or three bites, my mind’s elsewhere but suddenly i’m surprised by how good i feel. i’m starting to believe the digestive system does actually start with chewing &amp; that passage to thru the esophagus

2022-10-23 at 17:39:50: i grabbed some ezekiel sprouted grain bread from the store yesterday, having avo toast now with it, first time trying ezekiel in a while... and goddammit, i can feel the difference between this and the cheaper bread i’ve been getting

2022-10-23 at 17:32:46: this week i made scientific thinking progress through taking notes on papers i wanted to deep dive into, conversations with colleagues, talking to myself on my walk, impassioned ideation and writing on the bus ride home

2022-10-23 at 17:31:15: excited to work and think supa hard this week, building flowy momentum up to my next deliverable (1h progress presentation next next tues)

2022-10-23 at 06:54:17: @profeshkitten yessss!!! chilling in the car now but we’re going back soon and it’ll be electronic and also ukrainian tribal :O 💖

2022-10-23 at 05:46:23: yeah i brought earplugs and even extras if needed

2022-10-23 at 05:44:47: and just like that i’m headed to sf for a rave i decided to go to half an hour ago

2022-10-23 at 02:21:19: this is what my silly soft heart wants for dinner and i cannot deny her https://t.co/rO1YkLn1QC

2022-10-23 at 00:46:42: @wholebodyprayer ahh... felt that in the heart

2022-10-23 at 00:10:00: RT @this_is_silvia: #204. kiss me here, here, and here https://t.co/D0YsvcQxmz

2022-10-22 at 20:56:33: that and a good lunch, fairly good night of sleep, and staying hydrated as i go about my day

2022-10-22 at 20:48:46: my vibes are immaculate today !! it’s the peace that arises from spending time in loving presence with yourself 🤍🌟

2022-10-22 at 19:49:17: @isosteph i have such a strong aesthetic aversion to ":P", had to reply and say as such, even ironically using it is making me recoil. but had to, for the bit

2022-10-22 at 19:46:47: manifesting shiitake mushrooms at the grocery store real hard. last time i went they were all out and i was crestfallen

2022-10-22 at 19:44:13: @isosteph :P

2022-10-22 at 19:42:58: @isosteph here is one olive???

2022-10-22 at 19:41:47: eating these leftovers and they bring me so much joy. so friggin tasty. i cooked the onions and beets to just the right level; the small layer of shredded gouda midway through adds a subtle but delicious flavor; the overall texture is overwhelmingly pleasant

2022-10-22 at 19:01:09: @wife_immaterial hai miss glowy and cozy

2022-10-22 at 17:16:43: i am at higher risk of osteoporosis as i age and for a while this caused great consternation &amp; avoidance. glad to not feel that way anymore - to be able to face reality as it is, and be proactive and have a positive felt-sense about the state of my body

2022-10-22 at 17:15:24: yay for discovering and adding sources of calcium to my diet: goat milk, now chia seed pudding! makes me feel good about providing my bones with what they need

2022-10-22 at 17:02:46: @teleosistem thank you, i will try that orientation :)

2022-10-22 at 16:46:44: craving the soul soothing effect of nature so bad... planning on a trail run this weekend, wanted to go today but don’t want to destroy my legs. we’ll see how i feel after groceries!

2022-10-22 at 16:43:28: when your awareness expands you begin to pay more attention to things. and as you pay more attention things will tell you when they need to be taken care of

2022-10-22 at 06:57:57: 30k steps today my legs feel like jelly

2022-10-22 at 06:54:46: some weekly patterns / rhythms of life that are emerging for me:

wfh wednesdays
laundry on either wed or sat or sun
groceries either wed or sat depending on when i start running low
runs 3x/week, twice during the week once on the weekend
cook mon night and make lunch for tues

2022-10-22 at 06:15:07: i give myself permission to enjoy a slow saturday morning. to wake up and delight in the 8-10am energy. i’ll set an alarm for 8 hours after my bed time. i wish to wake up and hold my awareness in my body, to observe it stretch and lengthen as i move

2022-10-22 at 02:54:48: oki all done! like if you’d wanna hang in spaces sometime &amp; i’ll tag u next time :)

2022-10-22 at 02:41:48: come hang in my space if you’d like

2022-10-22 at 02:39:58: https://t.co/uencMKUCiq

2022-10-22 at 02:08:26: 1. there are a few hobbies/side pursuits we have a feeling it’ll be way funner &amp; easier to do when we’re living together: climbing, gardening, making music

2022-10-22 at 02:03:15: high off meaning

2022-10-22 at 02:03:08: high on meaning

2022-10-22 at 01:46:40: it took me like three youtube searches and starting to watch three videos before i finally found one that gave me the info i wanted.... yay for staying focused on my curiosity!

2022-10-22 at 01:30:47: i should try green tea with less flavonoids... haven't been enjoying green tea lately bc of bitterness/adjacent flavor. and looks like flavonoids could be responsible for that bitterness

2022-10-22 at 01:29:09: current rabbithole on chemical composition of green tea
https://t.co/XGvoHKCfPa

2022-10-22 at 00:26:53: @teleosistem having routine on a daily &amp; weekly scale seems to be huge for allowing this flow ime. curious if tru for u

2022-10-22 at 00:23:23: @teleosistem cool to see this in words. i am somewhere between step 1 and 2 - experienced step 1 in july-august of this year for the first time. i sure would like to know how to get to higher flow in the moment! (or frankly, how to achieve that state i was in earlier this year)

2022-10-21 at 16:15:14: about to take a shower and mmmmmf the warm water is gonna feel so good on my slightly sore calves and tense shoulders

2022-10-21 at 16:07:55: @tasshinfogleman 🤍🤍🤍

2022-10-21 at 05:59:49: @myceliummage hallo how’s it hangin in berlin

2022-10-21 at 03:07:34: might have to replicate this meal when bf is in town next week... teehee i love my evolution into gf who can cook 👩🏽‍🍳🌟

2022-10-21 at 02:59:59: both the frittata and fries turned out flawlessly 🙌🏽

2022-10-20 at 23:34:05: okay i think i'm gonna make golden beet frittata and japanese sweet potato fries for dinner. feels like something's missing, don't know what tho!

2022-10-20 at 17:10:14: i ♥️ the bay. glad my work and education choices have tethered me here for at least half a decade. every day my identity further intertwines with this landscape. i am coming to a deep way of knowing this place, and what “deep knowing” looks like is unique to each of us

2022-10-20 at 17:04:30: the bay reflects the color of the sky, and so some days it’s a striking metallic baby blue, and other days the water is an expansive white surface, mirroring the overcast skies. it’s always beautiful

2022-10-20 at 17:02:43: i’m beginning to hear the rhythm of sentences again... this bodes well!

2022-10-20 at 17:02:09: back right seat of the bus is my cozy space. it’s excellent for alone time. love sitting here and reading or crocheting or just existing, and when we cross the bridge i can look a ways north to sausalito and beyond. on clear days i can see the golden gate bridge

2022-10-20 at 15:17:57: to qualify: i think coming to understand “all” biology through one’s rational mind is unrealistic. however i believe you can also come to know biology in a non-linear way, through experiences of near-spiritual insight &amp; development of intuition

2022-10-20 at 15:07:37: pls pardon my use of the wrong “it’s”

2022-10-20 at 15:07:12: biology has this mystical quality to it. its unfathomably complex. i think part of the joy of studying biology is its elusiveness, its fractal complexity; you don’t go into biology trying to understand *all* biology, that’s just unreasonable

2022-10-20 at 15:04:55: there’s some part of me that shuts down when someone expresses a specific sort of reductionist belief system: eg “if we understand all anatomy we would perfectly understand all biology”

2022-10-19 at 23:22:27: i’ve been considering making beanies for people i care for who live far away in colder climates. maybe i will make a project out of it. 3 beanies, 3 letters

2022-10-19 at 23:21:06: i know seeing a crochet project from start to finish will be extraordinarily good for getting my creative energy flowing...

2022-10-19 at 23:15:39: thanks all for your responses, keep them coming! i’ll have time to respond later tonight :)

2022-10-19 at 19:42:15: i could:

- hike
- journal at the park
- read ramakrishna at the park
- read vivekananda at the park

2022-10-19 at 19:35:28: it’s nice out ☀️ and i have a free afternoon and it’s my wfh day ••• seeking ideas for activities to do to enjoy some time outdoors

2022-10-19 at 19:20:14: i really enjoy incorporating greens into my diet despite not knowing exactly what benefit they provide

2022-10-19 at 05:18:53: where does tension accumulate in your body?

2022-10-19 at 05:13:43: @hamzaiandafirst happy to share more info over dms - i don’t know everything about ayurveda but might have some pointers

2022-10-19 at 05:10:29: @tasshinfogleman ❤️ i feel it!

2022-10-19 at 05:10:01: @joespurpleshirt ❤️🥺 thank you jane! hope you and nyla are doing well 💗

2022-10-18 at 19:42:26: @yokaihainen tweets about one’s phd advisor are a favorite subgenre of mine

2022-10-18 at 19:14:25: i love creating ripples in the collective consciousness hehe

2022-10-18 at 19:08:53: “both husband and wife had their minds attuned to the Infinite” 🤍 what a wonderful ideal for marriage &amp; partnership https://t.co/RFxhNSJ99r

2022-10-18 at 19:05:49: next chapter titled “finding divinity in the wife” has my heart melting with how sri ramakrishna took on his duties as husband. the love and care he showed holy mother!

2022-10-18 at 18:49:07: below, what’s required imo for progress in science and in spirituality. grateful i get to cultivate these things through my intertwined paths

🔸 science - curiosity &amp; execution
🔹 spirituality - depth of love/devotion &amp; practice

2022-10-18 at 18:42:49: on the chapter now where he realizes god through various faiths. his profound experiences of islam and christianity are so cool to read about. his capacity for divine love, devotion, and one-pointedness are incredible

2022-10-18 at 18:40:25: currently reading a book on the life of sri ramakrishna, really enjoying it

2022-10-18 at 18:30:59: @nickcammarata so wild how awakening - that process of letting go - strengthens personality. i wouldn’t have believed you until i experienced it for myself

2022-10-18 at 18:26:31: @taalumot 🤍🤍🤍 the truth of “undergo both extremes... and then get up and do it again”

2022-10-18 at 18:24:45: roommate paid my cooking a tremendous compliment last night. her stomach often hurts after meals. she said that her stomach never hurts after eating the food i make 😭 this ayurvedic cooking thing must be working huh

2022-10-18 at 18:04:17: @thecreatorkat ☺️💕

2022-10-18 at 17:33:18: looking forward to my run this evening and an hour or two of nice deep thinking afterward

2022-10-18 at 17:32:12: omg it’s gonna be 80 degrees in berkeley tomorrow!

2022-10-18 at 17:15:53: had a nice call with bf ^-^ we imagined reading together at night when we live together. also, we got optimistic about the day ahead - aim for small wins to create momentum

2022-10-18 at 16:44:14: a hug and reassurance (that i am capable and loved, that today will be better than yesterday) would go a long ways

2022-10-18 at 16:39:38: @profeshkitten last photo has some heart wrenching quality to it. makes me think of growing older &amp; coming closer to mortality

2022-10-18 at 16:38:10: @profeshkitten pleasure from the vibrance of the orange and its complementarity to the shade of green

2022-10-18 at 16:37:21: bf and i both being grad students means that there are shared experiences &amp; struggles we both understand or are coming to understand

yesterday he put into words a feeling i was having - becoming frazzled bc of the overwhelmingness of unknowns

2022-10-18 at 02:04:56: @pratibimbana absolutely baffled at that one tbh but i love it for you

2022-10-18 at 02:04:08: @pratibimbana i’m with u on all but bullet point 2

2022-10-18 at 01:36:25: &gt; connects with indian heritage while learning to cook 
&gt; yay there are so many choices of daals! masoor, toor, chana, urad, moong...
&gt; gets into ayurveda
&gt; moong is supreme. masoor is good too. all the others r bad

2022-10-18 at 01:24:42: @gptbrooke really loved this one. felt it. he has a beautiful and evocative voice

2022-10-18 at 01:16:27: reply with songs that make u feel like everything’s gonna be okay

2022-10-18 at 01:02:48: @TheGrandBlooms also the next time i cry. craving that feeling of cleansing and catharsis

2022-10-18 at 00:57:01: @TheGrandBlooms hugging bf in two weeks;
hugging family in a little over a month;
getting home tonight and petting my silly little cat and making healing lentil soup and going for a run once my stomach has settled after dinner

2022-10-16 at 16:40:03: theory: one way tripping diminishes your ego is by overriding/overpowering the thoughts with intense physical sensations

2022-10-16 at 05:59:19: gonna see if i can get my friend to sing radhe govinda with me

2022-10-16 at 04:42:11: retweeting cozy things from my media tab 1+ years ago don’t mind meee

2022-10-16 at 04:27:01: if i end up tripping tonight i hope to read about sri ramakrishna in the wee hours of the morning

2022-10-16 at 04:26:11: @allisonwilens 💪🏽🥳

2022-10-16 at 04:13:15: omg i should have worn this specific wrapped stone necklace too, one friend gave me and another friend the two sister necklaces

2022-10-16 at 04:06:45: forgot to wear my lucky turtle ring! alas

2022-10-16 at 00:04:07: i’m hopeful there will be wholesome, deep, connective conversations; peaceful morning moments in the forest - that the air is crisp and laden with scent; good music on loud speakers; and pleasant memories formed with friends new and old

2022-10-16 at 00:00:44: tonight a friend and i are driving down the coast a little ways to party with our french friend and his polycule..... chaos awaits

2022-10-15 at 21:41:12: making a pretty grocery list definitely helped https://t.co/VdB1Xf4Co7

2022-10-15 at 21:39:03: @hormeze @embryosophy !!!

2022-10-15 at 21:38:35: yay for getting my weekend groceries done today!

2022-10-15 at 20:45:11: just got to local indian store for a few groceries; the scent, sights, and people speaking hindi in the background coalesce to create a deep feeling of comfort in me. i’m almost crying!

2022-10-15 at 17:57:10: before i had a morning routine, i had no way of transforming or channeling the emotional state i woke up in

2022-10-15 at 17:49:57: tis the season for nasya (oiling your nostrils)

2022-10-15 at 04:39:15: @altsanabo chill night in! just ironed a favorite nightgown ... simple pleasures. about to make a late night snack

2022-10-15 at 04:13:06: @goblinodds awww boo migraine. that sounds like a fun evening! i just took a lovely shower and will make some food next. then hopefully a call with bf!

2022-10-15 at 04:11:35: @zencephalon yayy sounds cozy

2022-10-15 at 03:57:33: hi friday night twitter who’s up n what are you up to

2022-10-14 at 22:09:48: note to self: you can open up to your advisor about the internal process of doing the work - he often has useful advice not just about the science, but about the psychology too!

2022-10-14 at 18:51:15: RT @lilaexpt: tell me about ur fav ways to un-contract ur awareness. or what was that instrumental domino that fell in your experience/ego…

2022-10-14 at 16:54:28: just gotta hit that switch, from:

i don’t know anything, it’s daunting to get started digging into the scientific literature ➡️ my mind is meant for assimilating information, i love swimming in the tides of knowledge, surfing on a specific wave

2022-10-14 at 16:48:53: @eIfcup 💕😊

2022-10-14 at 16:00:49: long commute schedule optimization pondering: hm maybe i will switch from

4 days/week (m-t-th-fri) commuting (1h15 each way), full work days

to

5 days/week commuting, allowing half days two days out of the week

2022-10-14 at 15:54:25: somehow only this week is the summer-to-fall transition really hitting me. and not in a good way! it’s quite disarming

2022-10-14 at 15:37:22: tell me about ur fav ways to un-contract ur awareness. or what was that instrumental domino that fell in your experience/ego and expanded ur awareness by some notable amount 🙂

2022-10-14 at 15:33:38: i hope to be increasingly able to un-contract my awareness without the help of cannabis

2022-10-14 at 15:32:05: one thing cannabis helps me do is un-contract my awareness. thoughts are freer to arise and float through my stream of awareness, rather than become further entangled in the web of ego-thoughts

2022-10-13 at 23:52:18: gonna go hang &amp; help a friend harvest stuff from his garden, then a run, and hopefully a call with bf too. i think all this will be good for morale! i’m feeling a little bit demoralized about work

2022-10-13 at 23:10:03: @er1enney0ung made my day, thank you éri 🤍

2022-10-13 at 23:08:54: @liekovarpio i feel this way after a year in my science phd program :’) so nice to be able to be tender and curious and witness others’ tenderness and curiosity

2022-10-13 at 21:19:03: feeling frustrated by a number of things, it’s a static-y buzzing in my head and neck, trying now to walk it off

2022-10-13 at 19:57:44: @allgarbled @BecomingCritter yea i was gonna say protractor on my screen

2022-10-13 at 17:10:17: @yogacid @alex_here_now @erik_davis sick i’m interested in reading both!

2022-10-13 at 16:38:54: as of late when i close my eyes and take a few deep breaths i can feel my mind swirl around me

2022-10-13 at 05:22:56: @bit_christ @prerationalist 👀 is this true in your experience?

2022-10-13 at 00:36:35: luv asking people for their running routes and then trying them &amp; reporting back. makes me feel closer to them

2022-10-12 at 00:41:41: refuse to get tiktok so i replace it with ig reels - here is my favorite reel ever https://t.co/xQxnbwwZ5b

2022-10-11 at 17:18:11: i owe it to myself to finish writing this, to immortalize an utterly transformative period of life

2022-10-11 at 17:16:53: yup. it’s gotta be my piece on the first year of my phd. i have a draft from months ago that’s maybe 2/3 done, looked at it this morning for the first time in months and was deeply moved by the beauty and truth of my words - the way my mind poured onto the page

2022-10-10 at 05:44:30: roasted fall veggies (red &amp; golden beets, yams, japanese sweet potato, carrot) with ghee, rosemary, fennel seed, and salt https://t.co/bKAcdA6Txs

2022-10-10 at 02:29:41: was just making my bed and had a moment of identification: the way we light diyas on diwali to welcome lakshmi into our homes - i’m making my bed for me, that divine spark within me, to make her feel clear-minded and safe when it is time to sleep

2022-10-10 at 00:58:25: as always there are different angles. the thoughts are god too. you can meditate and practice revering each thought as a manifestation of shakti

2022-10-10 at 00:54:12: moments without thought are like the spaces in between your breaths. both are god

2022-10-10 at 00:51:57: flow states are experiences of union with god

2022-10-09 at 22:40:12: also, grocery shopping when you’re not in the rhythm of cooking - go easy on yourself! start with simple things you know how to make. you can add in an exciting new dish next week

2022-10-09 at 21:20:05: have to remind myself of this before i go grocery shopping bc i can get anxious and demoralized trying to decide on the week’s meals

2022-10-09 at 21:18:55: the food you make doesn’t have to be complicated or fancy to be good! simple food can be deeply nourishing

2022-10-09 at 21:02:58: perhaps a good first knitting project for me would be a yellow &amp; blue striped scarf for my dad

2022-10-09 at 20:06:19: @eIfcup i also like how my gums feel after! haha

2022-10-09 at 19:48:52: @eIfcup u still oil pulling? i’ve been enjoying it recently

2022-10-09 at 19:48:26: it’s interesting how creative endeavors arise. sometimes you need to hold a loose vision in your mind, hold it gently - not too tightly! - and trust it will come back to you if it is meant to be. hold that loose vision and let the salient notes from your experiences populate it

2022-10-09 at 19:45:28: maybe you’re avoiding that task because it’s too ambitious - be with the avoidance and it will tell you this. make the task smaller - just getting started on the thing, just setting a 20 min timer and doing what you can in that time

2022-10-09 at 19:43:48: an assumption i used to make with to-do lists is that it’s trivial to transition between tasks you’ve laid out for yourself. sometimes it is! sometimes it isn’t, and you have to give yourself the care you need in between

2022-10-09 at 02:26:07: think i’m on a gradual ascent to my peak fitness level ever in life. bone density goin up, cardiovascular system getting stronger, aerobic capacity increasing, mitochondria multiplying

2022-10-08 at 23:15:21: what a wonderful chaotic set of shared experiences in a beautiful, almost mystical place. new friends were made &amp; friendships were deepened!

2022-10-08 at 21:40:30: every time i taste that deep steadiness within, i long to live my life in a deep way

2022-10-08 at 21:37:00: when i’m tripping i often feel as though i almost can’t bear the emotions &amp; sensations i’m feeling; they’re almost overwhelming, i’m teetering on a precipice, can’t tell if i’m enjoying myself or in discomfort (probably both, but i wouldn’t know)

2022-10-08 at 20:52:00: @Lan_Dao_ near monterey :)

2022-10-08 at 03:45:07: @relic_radiation @smallkewlhuman @ElijahBallingxr somehow reminds me of goldmund from herman hesse’s book “narcissus and goldmund”

2022-10-08 at 02:48:35: RT @_StevenFan: Peers in agency. In navigating possible worlds. In seeing subtle causality. Moving in flow. And remarking on it with poetic…

2022-10-08 at 02:48:01: @_StevenFan yesss well said!

2022-10-06 at 17:00:12: heading off to phd program’s departmental retreat today! time to meet the new students and get up to no good with my friends

2022-10-06 at 16:29:32: @self_beware @relic_radiation oho wow this made those concepts make sense

2022-10-05 at 20:42:54: RT @wholebodyprayer: People behave better when they feel loved

2022-10-05 at 19:23:52: allowing myself to just enjoy my lighter than usual workload this week, without clinging to it, without clinging to anxiety about next week

2022-10-05 at 17:48:28: too good https://t.co/suBZ3gRc8a

2022-10-05 at 06:16:22: life really is all about picking up the projects we start

2022-10-05 at 05:58:55: tonight i picked up a crochet project i last worked on in july ☺️🥳 putting some stitches in before bed now 😌 got an idea of a pretty way to do the collar 🌷

2022-10-05 at 05:39:10: how do you feel about the idea of being reincarnated as a cat in your next life?

2022-10-05 at 02:44:35: holding oneself in kinder regard 🔄 holding others in kinder regard

is a wonderful positive feedback cycle. talk to urself like u would a friend, and in the process learn new ways of talking to others. &amp; vice versa

2022-10-05 at 01:11:06: i had an excellent meeting with my advisor today! 🙌🏽 

he praised a few of the actions i had taken since our last meeting, and confirmed that i’m making progress &amp; that my “questions are getting sharper”

2022-10-05 at 01:08:23: @RichardBono7 say more?

2022-10-05 at 01:05:40: probably one of the first such interactions i’ve had with my mother. it was so sweet! i’m so glad she sought me out &amp; i got to be there for her. aww we both be growing up &amp; both be healing 💗

2022-10-05 at 01:04:26: mom called me for reassurance on a course of action she was taking &amp; not sure about... and i got to reflect the situation back to her and support her &amp; she said my words made her feel better!

2022-10-04 at 19:25:23: there are no absolutes, and yet we continue to seek them. all we can do is learn to listen to our hearts &amp; enjoy the lifelong process of getting to know ourselves

2022-10-04 at 19:01:29: oh that silly thought pattern that entreats you to give up on things when they don’t immediately feel good

2022-10-04 at 18:26:43: @soundrotator vv helpful reminder for me too!

2022-10-04 at 18:24:30: in the guided meditation portion of the class, continuity was described as continuous awareness/attention between breaths. this made sense to me, even if i couldn’t sustain it for long

2022-10-04 at 18:23:12: went to a meditation class last week &amp; learned that three pillars of shamatha, or calm abiding, are relaxation, continuity, and clarity/luminosity. my thoughts keep returning to these pillars, and guide me to ask: how can i support continuity in my daily life?

2022-10-04 at 03:15:01: you are strange just as i am strange and i love you

2022-10-04 at 02:34:42: @poIypore truly! discovered him through canadian bf

2022-10-04 at 02:30:36: newly discovering &amp; appreciating this caribou album https://t.co/M6LUnjFJl5

2022-10-04 at 01:35:45: makes me wanna get around to reading @neuralkn0t’s thesis on interpersonal coherence...

2022-10-04 at 01:32:12: i started to notice “interpersonal ego” after this - the creation, persistence, and dissolution of thoughts held between two people &amp; effects on relationship dynamics https://t.co/zHTWdUR43u

2022-10-03 at 20:44:31: starting to track my spending, yesterday i calculated my breakdown for the month of september: 59% fixed costs, 14% investments, 17% spending, 11% savings

2022-10-03 at 19:43:46: how 2 reconcile reverence for life force in all forms - other humans, animals, plants, everything - with an ant problem in your kitchen? surely each ant contains life, but i feel compelled to end their lives

2022-10-03 at 19:41:45: in the mood to watch a documentary about jainism

2022-10-03 at 06:54:46: the way the moon looks bigger when it’s near the horizon is one of my favorite things about living on earth

2022-10-03 at 06:54:08: just watched moonset over the hills in the distance at bf’s place in LA and it was spectacular. orange slice of moon sank slowly and sped up and pulsed orange and white as it crossed the hills

2022-09-30 at 22:56:28: @FractalAuth sending love through the aether! just a day or two ago the thought arose to prepare a ~mushroom experience centered on self-acceptance

2022-09-30 at 20:42:48: @yogacid @DhammaService is disclosure of substance use routine before meditation retreats? (it would make sense)

2022-09-30 at 20:09:06: @myceliummage sickkkk! so excited for you

2022-09-30 at 17:39:44: @xsphi @____keh 🤍

2022-09-30 at 17:20:31: thanks friends! i chose (3). definitely worth it!

2022-09-30 at 16:31:38: debating between ways to get to the airport

(1) public transit, get there a few min after boarding starts, anxiety inducing, $6

(2) transit + lyft, get there a little sooner, have to transfer, $14

(3) lyft, get there w time to spare, cognitively easiest, $20

2022-09-30 at 06:22:55: @rhymeswithvocal google calendar + trello for evolving daily to do lists &amp; longer term things

2022-09-30 at 06:20:22: @profeshkitten @tasshinfogleman so good!

2022-09-30 at 04:04:33: had a beautiful evening run, 3mi, running towards the berkeley hills with houses lit up against the darkening sky, smells of campfire and floral sweetness in the air

2022-09-30 at 01:37:16: strange spaceyness descended upon me about an hour ago. it’s not unpleasant. my head feels empty. i can read words but nothing sticks

2022-09-29 at 05:24:25: @finlesswonder awwww just skimming but i already love this. wowww. you know what else i like to read? the acknowledgments sections of phd theses. similar vibe, reflecting on those that have impacted you

2022-09-29 at 05:21:53: @finlesswonder i started reading meditations two years ago but don’t recall that chapter - let me take a look! 🤍

2022-09-29 at 05:20:42: 🤍 https://t.co/9QdhjJLiKm

2022-09-29 at 05:10:40: how did you make contact with the divinity within today?

2022-09-29 at 02:47:36: @profeshkitten still in progress - fried quinoa, japanese sweet potato fries, and hummus!

2022-09-29 at 02:12:29: the last time i had a dinner that deeply satiated me, at a physical level &amp; at a soul level, was saturday night. on track for another such dinner tonight!

2022-09-29 at 02:10:51: something friends have repeatedly told me is that i am uniquely willing to initiate difficult conversations

2022-09-28 at 23:51:15: @taalumot on a recent visit i got not one, not two, but three injections of a local anesthetic into my gums and my body was straight up vibrating in the dentist's chair

2022-09-28 at 23:19:34: started a proper financial tracking spreadsheet and i’m so excited to gain more info on myself &amp; adapt the system to my needs!

2022-09-28 at 20:04:25: this is something my phd has been helping me cultivate. in order to progress scientifically, you have to be honest with where your understanding is! you cannot posture! and there’s no need to, ideally your earnest curiosity is all that’s needed https://t.co/GAsrcTtJZB

2022-09-28 at 19:11:19: @tapir_worf dude it’s so good. really opened my eyes, really well done, generally captivating. i like that they allow for some silence in between people talking, makes for a slow start but lets things sink in later on

https://t.co/cTv0Uz1v7p

2022-09-28 at 18:52:54: @tapir_worf have you listened to cover story?!

2022-09-28 at 18:43:38: the more u think about a decision the more of your life force energy you put into it. some decisions do in fact require more energy; but many day to day decisions can be made with less obsession, less anxiety, &amp; less rumination

2022-09-28 at 17:11:32: i’m tired of contracting and tensing when i have a thought i think i shouldn’t have

2022-09-28 at 17:10:25: omg i just remembered i can exercise and this will improve things at least a little

2022-09-28 at 17:08:42: i just want that quietness n flow n lack of self criticism n releasing thoughts sometimes effortlessly to come back...

2022-09-28 at 17:07:22: could traveling for four out of the five weekends this month have something to do with it? ahaha

2022-09-28 at 17:06:07: my mind has been noticeably more restless for the past ~week. stark contrast to the quietness &amp; flow i was experiencing in august. it will be interesting to observe how the restlessness resolves itself!

2022-09-27 at 18:05:47: @grantbels hahaha that’s a creative interpretation. i was being extremely literal. basically i’ve been struggling to take this medicine at a consistent time... and i remembered tasshin tweeting once that if u wanted to do something, writing down your commitment / intention could help

2022-09-26 at 22:43:34: @grantbels noted, your encouragement is much appreciated!

2022-09-26 at 20:24:44: systems are how we unify our thinking

2022-09-26 at 19:57:22: @wayfaring_tim @visakanv so lovely - your voice, the music, both the more mundane moments and the grand scenery

2022-09-26 at 19:17:48: there’s a medicine i have to take daily, and if i vary the time of consumption too much, i’m in pain as early as the next day. i commit to taking this medicine at the same time of day each day (10pm)

2022-09-26 at 18:43:28: he be a sattvic cat for sure

2022-09-26 at 18:43:06: thinking of going to sleep early enough that i can just wake up when my cat wakes up and scratches at my bedroom door to be let out at 5:40am

2022-09-26 at 17:58:35: @alth0u althou this SLAPS 🤍

2022-09-26 at 17:57:50: i can feel my heart almost ready to commit to completing &amp; refining my next piece of writing

2022-09-26 at 06:30:02: IRL likely in east bay; donation based; would be nice if people came to multiple sessions to foster a sense of familiarity / nurture nascent connections, but not mandatory for a person to come for all 6; perhaps a special event to mark the conclusion of this pilot

2022-09-26 at 06:27:22: current thinking: pilot of 6 sessions, capped at 6-8 people each, 2x/month, dinner provided. each session has a question/central concept relevant to spirituality/spiritual practice; sharing and discussion will be facilitated https://t.co/seOaRGEXU1

2022-09-26 at 06:07:28: @nickcammarata taggin @altsanabo so he sees too ^-^

2022-09-26 at 06:07:03: @nickcammarata just remembered, bf loooves this stuff. 2.5% abv. tart but smooth, sweeter than beer, all around lovely &amp; perhaps ideal for your use case! can find in beers section of trader joe’s &amp; some bars https://t.co/DyUGYKKhNg

2022-09-26 at 04:35:52: the instructions for emotional processing are spot 👏🏽 on 👏🏽. who knew wikihow could be a resource for learning emotional regulation? https://t.co/13EYA2OZFR

2022-09-26 at 04:29:40: found this talk &amp; its transcript from 2003. loving it! integrates compassion (daya) with other concepts i know - ahimsa, bliss; compassion involves gaining "reverence for all life"

https://t.co/mUdwnAbsen

2022-09-26 at 04:26:21: have been feeling drawn towards cultivation of compassion. 'cultivation of compassion' feels somehow buddhist to me. but surely compassion practices are widespread amongst faiths. diving into hinduism now to find relevant ideas and practices

2022-09-26 at 04:05:21: feels tonight. oh the sweetness of witnessing one another amidst the passage of time https://t.co/jKRq87HGXp

2022-09-25 at 21:15:35: @grantbels out of curiosity, how often do you clean apt / diff parts of apt?

2022-09-25 at 06:40:41: @quotidiania im such a west coast gal 😭

2022-09-25 at 06:35:47: @quotidiania no just visiting!

2022-09-25 at 05:23:45: yuh https://t.co/7a9C3YS5z9

2022-09-25 at 05:01:36: @nomanautomata @nickcammarata i knowww i appreciate the reassurance 🥺🙏🏽

2022-09-25 at 04:56:55: @nomanautomata @nickcammarata maybe the overwhelming ness was a testament to some sort of internal progress 🤷🏽‍♀️

2022-09-25 at 04:55:54: @nomanautomata @nickcammarata my last psychedelic experience was pretty overwhelming... don’t think i’ve ever felt so untethered. not in a rush to repeat

2022-09-25 at 04:54:42: @nomanautomata @nickcammarata i just have such cognitive dissonance bc i feel i’m on a spiritual / meditative path but still a bit of a heavyweight with substances. i guess it reaffirms i have subtler things to tune into...... and then this train of thought sometimes makes me feel bad to enjoy substances

2022-09-25 at 04:49:45: crossing the C ᵒⁿᶜᵒᵘʳˢᵉ https://t.co/zstohc65HN

2022-09-25 at 04:45:07: @nickcammarata i think some people are just baseline more sensitive!

2022-09-25 at 04:42:44: @nickcammarata why do you think so many are so sensitive to substances? is it something like, the more into meditation you are the more sensitive your nervous system gets

2022-09-25 at 04:29:52: dearly, deeply, and completely

2022-09-25 at 03:28:19: gonna get some 1am coffee once i get back to cambridge hehe

2022-09-24 at 23:03:03: does it depend on what negative emotions we are introduced to as children?

2022-09-24 at 23:02:38: what are the first negative emotions we learn to recognize in ourselves, beyond “i feel bad”?

2022-09-24 at 22:29:13: smell felt heaven-sent, god intervening for a moment on this physical plane

2022-09-24 at 22:27:17: i think it being chilly outside is a big factor for the coziness

2022-09-24 at 22:26:34: it smells like palo santo in the orange line downtown crossing station, forest hills bound

2022-09-24 at 22:20:11: so fucking cozy sitting in between two larger strangers on a subway rn... who knew being packed in like sardines could be so cozy...

2022-09-24 at 21:08:39: lol i used to want to intellectually understand how we think with our bodies but i ended up with an embodied wordless understanding instead

2022-09-24 at 20:57:39: heading to the only thrift store i’ll be able to fit into this visit, wish me luck in finding my perfect cambridge sweater

2022-09-24 at 19:25:00: just an hour or so til i get to hang with my college friend who i haven’t seen in yearssss! we met in an anthropology course and one day after class i saw her at the bus stop and knew i had to talk to her

2022-09-24 at 17:43:20: @rhymeswithvocal lightning fast response tho wow

2022-09-24 at 17:42:51: @rhymeswithvocal mmmmf i haven’t set up circle yet bc it feels like another layer of complication in my twitter experience ........ guess it could be nice tho

2022-09-24 at 17:40:52: @rhymeswithvocal wonder what the twitter equivalent of hearthmaxxing is

2022-09-24 at 17:40:01: omg just remembered many of my friends back in the bay are at a certain music festival this weekend doing all sorts of substances... may their journeys be safe, illuminating, and joyous 🌸

2022-09-24 at 17:38:11: @rhymeswithvocal thank u charlie needed this

2022-09-24 at 17:37:54: feel like i’ve been in maintenance / diving deeper into existing twitter friendships mode, considering trying a shift into actively investing in new connections mode

2022-09-24 at 17:36:19: @grantbels yes! it was spectacular! glad you noticed :)

2022-09-24 at 17:02:48: @irafeierabend @relic_radiation first photo somehow feels unnerving; second photo much less so, more evocative and tender to me

2022-09-24 at 15:55:54: yayyyy for invigorating science conversations with friends old and new

2022-09-23 at 05:44:14: god does it feel good to have my land legs back

2022-09-23 at 05:35:07: one last stop before i can get off this train... it’s been a hellish ride with bountiful motion sickness

2022-09-23 at 04:34:16: it’s a packed 2 day trip with a red eye there and a red eye back. lots of social things scheduled, reconnecting with old friends! will be special to see them in person. planning to run on adrenaline, appreciation of novelty, and social energy :’))

2022-09-23 at 04:27:00: i get to see hah vard tomorrow for the first time ever!

2022-09-23 at 04:19:11: my brain cannot reconcile my current reality (9pm after a long day in the bay) with tomorrow morning (+3 hours in a city i haven’t been to since childhood!)

2022-09-23 at 04:17:40: just stepped out of my apartment en route to the airport for a trip to the east coast !

2022-09-23 at 03:21:24: it stands to reason that the thrift shop sweater collection would be more interesting in boston than in berkeley, right....?

2022-09-22 at 18:01:18: my mental waters sure do be agitated today, but it’s nice to be able to observe this rather than just be stuck in it

2022-09-22 at 00:27:49: oh my goodness we’re almost in sunset before 7pm territory

2022-09-21 at 20:44:48: @sweetfernery omg my lab mate was telling me about this book lol. apparently a mole (6e23 ish) of moles (like the animal) is as big as the moon or something like that

2022-09-21 at 20:43:43: this is who i aspire to be for those i love https://t.co/uLD0K8BP8S

2022-09-21 at 20:32:39: gifting is not something that comes naturally to me / my family, so whenever i think of a gift that feels right my heart sings

2022-09-21 at 20:32:14: i think i’m gonna buy my dad a copy of murakami’s book on writing and running. my sense is he’d appreciate murakami’s words on exercise, practice, emotional regulation, and aging

2022-09-21 at 01:52:43: @pratibimbana when my mom started working more with bala mantra she found little girls  would just come up to her for some reason or another :’)

2022-09-21 at 01:46:10: funny thing i’ve observed since leaning into the scientist, curiosity-driven part of my identity is that i cannot stay mad/grumpy at bf if he shows me a compelling paper

2022-09-20 at 19:57:03: i keep remembering that paying attention to eye contact makes life at least 5x more fun

2022-09-20 at 19:52:31: i genuinely feel god guided me to my phd lab. even when things aren’t going well i always return to deep gratitude. for having been led to an environment where i am continually nurtured &amp; encouraged to be myself

2022-09-20 at 19:46:41: as it stands, our best guess for when bf and i will be able to conclude long distance and move in together is next summer. ongoing thread of wistful manifestations let’s go

2022-09-19 at 18:03:58: i feel my interpersonal frustrations often arise when i want someone to be different than they are now. perhaps patience is holding the space for them to change, and for my own expectations to evolve

2022-09-19 at 17:48:14: my advisor is willing to repeat the same explanations, same points to his mentees time and again until they comprehend them. there’s no sign of frustration at having to repeat himself; it’s as if he knows the repetition is necessary

2022-09-19 at 17:46:53: so i’m understanding the value of cultivating patience, in particular interpersonally

2022-09-19 at 00:56:03: good alone time feels like wading into the waters of your inner world, swimming in your tides of mind

2022-09-19 at 00:16:37: my cat perched beside my napping boyfriend, under the comforter https://t.co/23QclIy0wv

2022-09-18 at 21:14:05: finally reading some of meaningness, this is the first time it's caught my interest. but even so, having a hard time fully taking it into my being, perhaps because it is built upon an assertion of atheism

2022-09-18 at 20:25:51: @PrinceVogel this is incredible

2022-09-18 at 03:58:56: 40 min til bf and i are reunited ^-^ i made a nice lil yellow curry for dinner and packed him a serving for when i pick him up from the train station ^-^

2022-09-17 at 17:12:22: @donmexlar true wow well put

2022-09-17 at 02:06:29: @sweetfernery yayy how’s the air?

2022-09-17 at 01:25:23: hahaha the party i was gonna go to is actually next week. thank u universe!!!

2022-09-17 at 01:01:35: i think party would be interesting &amp; i’d have some engaging conversations... but at what cost! 😭 tell me twitter, what do i do?

2022-09-17 at 00:56:41: thought i wanted to go to a party tonight but i’m soooo tempted by the prospect of staying home and having sweet sweet alone time... starting on the thermo textbook i got 2day, reading this sick tantric meditation book i rediscovered, cleaning a new shelf i found...... 😭

2022-09-17 at 00:48:14: @sweetfernery aw sending you love and warmth

2022-09-17 at 00:31:39: my favorite thing about instagram is posting something and randomly getting a comment or reply from an old friend. with a few earnest words they came out of the void and crossed the distance, through time and space, to get to me

2022-09-16 at 02:15:22: walking from one bus stop to another downtown, made momentary eye contact with a blonde guy with blue eyes, not much taller than me, who smiled at me and said “hello!” i smiled and he called after me, “have a good night!”

2022-09-16 at 02:12:33: nice way to end a day spent feeling sad: heading over for a one on one hangout with a friend who lives walking distance away. he’ll be feeding me dinner too!

2022-09-15 at 21:35:24: feel like i need a list of friends who i can just call (in part so that it doesn’t feel like the end of the world when bf isn’t available)

2022-09-15 at 21:16:12: @_holyweather good question!

2022-09-15 at 20:53:46: @mathonwy @ActualAll10 somehow it never occurred to me that people could be lying about their heights

2022-09-15 at 18:31:40: alrighty i’m fairly certain i’ve got some hormonal bs going on that’s making me more emotional

2022-09-15 at 16:30:07: and now i’m crying at the dentist. strong start

2022-09-15 at 15:59:54: ah yes... rumination about my relationship... my favorite way to start the day 😪

2022-09-15 at 05:51:38: strongly considering getting an ava bracelet for cycle tracking. it’s marketed to women trying to conceive but i think even women not in that stage of life could benefit from awareness of their cycles

2022-09-15 at 00:13:33: @gracemercur not a bad idea, curious what’s drawing you to computer science?

2022-09-15 at 00:06:11: just absurd how much better i felt after meditating today. did a guided meditation which at one point leads you to feeling the presence of the holy mother in your heart, and i swear afterward i felt her presence in my body

2022-09-14 at 06:14:09: @christineist lookin fwd to intersecting w you in LA!

2022-09-14 at 02:51:47: or, alternatively, take steadying breaths and otherwise regulate my nervous system / body tension load

2022-09-14 at 02:48:26: and often all i need to feel at least a little better in moments of constriction, is the ability to release or pacify my ego

2022-09-14 at 02:47:29: can’t stop thinking about this tweet! wild to realize my general happiness has been tightly correlated to the expansiveness of my awareness &amp; extent of self knowledge https://t.co/sucFgUR87U

2022-09-13 at 15:25:23: update i absolutely killed the talk last night

2022-09-13 at 05:18:39: omwww to hot springs! first time ever experiencing them

2022-09-12 at 18:49:56: @christineist surreal to see tidbits of my writing highlighted and shared 💗 thank you christine :)

2022-09-12 at 07:06:26: i want to be sympathetic / charitable but her vibe is kinda dragging my vibe down

2022-09-12 at 07:05:50: lab mate and i both have presentations to prepare for tomorrow and her vibe is kinda anxious and overthinking everything and i just don’t want to engage

i’m tryna make &amp; refine my presentation out of the deep love i have for my work &amp; for good communication

2022-09-12 at 03:43:58: this afternoon a small group of us took the trolley to a lake and my lab mate gave me a swimming lesson amidst the mountainous scenery https://t.co/p7CzNNmVLl

2022-09-11 at 04:17:50: @gracemercur maybe u can reconfigure ur desires to be in alignment? or are desires immutable?

2022-09-10 at 17:10:17: @donmexlar hope u get to drink a nice beverage or consume a delectable pastry too

2022-09-10 at 15:44:38: @pratibimbana sunset bedtimes in the winter too? like 4:30/5pm?

2022-09-08 at 22:28:06: @grantbels dude i think i saw the headline when that came out, and immediately went out and bought 20:1 cbd edibles without doing any further reading. do you happen to know what the real deal is?

2022-09-08 at 22:26:35: @grantbels hahaha amazing. i’m just starting my journey with wearables, mainly for heart rate monitoring while exercising for now. what’s small dose for you &amp; is there a specific strain type/blend? (eg 1:1 thc cbd, sativa, indica, etc)

2022-09-08 at 22:16:57: @grantbels lol at “small doses of edibles are fine” - u kno i value that info haha

2022-09-08 at 22:15:06: @grantbels thank you for your input - much appreciated!

2022-09-08 at 21:32:24: i’ll probs also avoid alcohol &amp; cannabis bc i have some vague sense they’re immunosuppressants

2022-09-08 at 21:31:57: there’s a balance to be struck here between accepting whatever unfolds &amp; attempting to be proactive

2022-09-08 at 21:25:18: so let’s say i had a covid exposure last night &amp; i am quite keen on not getting it... what can i do to support my immune system? 

will take any and all suggestions - i’ve got echinacea extract, will have some raw garlic as per mom’s traditional remedy, get sleep, exercise...

2022-09-08 at 06:55:18: @christineist christine u are inspiring me to start hosting the events i want to see in the world! https://t.co/seOaRGnUS1

2022-09-08 at 04:09:12: craving expansion!!

2022-09-08 at 01:01:15: i’m working on an essay abt how i became aware of the connection between mind and body: how emotions manifest as physical sensations. a couple psychosomatic illnesses/ailments convinced me

curious how others came to be aware of mind-body connection; has anyone always known?

2022-09-07 at 03:07:41: stating to feel a little divergence between psychedelics &amp; my path

2022-09-07 at 03:06:51: love the process of guiding my body back to homeostasis

2022-09-07 at 03:04:30: really want to sew a two piece top/pants set, same pastel fabric; pants that cinch the waist but are a little wide in the legs, and a simple tank top with a simple neckline

2022-09-07 at 02:56:56: asked 5 and a half friends if they were down to hang tonight and finally found one who’s free. feelin like the littl train that could lmao

2022-09-07 at 02:42:25: where does your strength come from?

2022-09-03 at 19:04:22: i never believed in the power of hats until a 4-ho-met trip in late 2021. my friend emily hat-pilled me. i put one on in their chilly home with no heating and felt noticeably warmer in a minute or less

2022-09-03 at 05:36:53: @eIfcup yes u can re-up reliably up to 1h in!

2022-09-01 at 06:37:19: @spenceraviav yep! this has become much clearer to me in the past few months. fortunately once you realize this you can find ways to slip out of ego / manage ego &amp; stop getting in your own way so dang much

2022-09-01 at 05:07:41: on a walk home from picking up a hat, i crossed the street at the exact moment my monk friend was leaving on bike from a friend’s house, and we ran into each other! 

had i left my house at a different moment or had he departed at a different time this would not have happened...

2022-09-01 at 05:06:12: every time i run into someone serendipitously i marvel at the workings of the divine

2022-08-31 at 19:34:52: i hit one year with one friend on may 1st and every time i think of her i am grateful for her presence in my life

2022-08-31 at 19:34:06: i've been living in the bay for a little over two years and i'm hitting milestones of knowing friends for one year; in december i hit two years with a dear friend. i love burrowing into these relationships. they keep getting better with time!

2022-08-31 at 19:28:50: have any of you done mescaline? curious what your experience(s) was like. feel free to dm ☀️

2022-08-31 at 19:18:07: @altsanabo thank u for validation 🙏🏽

2022-08-31 at 19:17:47: @tasshinfogleman @altsanabo @christineist oh wow good to know! :)

2022-08-31 at 17:55:11: my most direct experiences of God these days are when I pray. the warm, loving, peaceful energy that builds in my chest (my heart) is an experience of God

2022-08-31 at 17:50:14: i feel like God usually reveals themself to me in the creases of everyday life. where in the living of every day life we weave a fabric, and God appears in moments that feel like folds of the fabric

2022-08-31 at 17:22:43: @christineist summoning @altsanabo too haha

2022-08-31 at 17:22:28: @christineist so i suppose i’ll just feel some discomfort about misalignment of the aesthetic i want (minimalist site) and the current aesthetic (substack). and at some point the discomfort will cross a threshold and then i’ll act?

lol basically does this sound reasonable or what would u do

2022-08-31 at 17:20:39: @christineist but i don’t have the know-how to spin one up quickly. (realizing some of my avoidance comes from a domain i have but which i don’t love aesthetically) ,,, so my plan has been to get in the flow of publishing stuff using substack and at some point migrate to/add personal site

2022-08-31 at 17:18:53: @christineist a request for thoughts: i have some writing that’s very close to being released, been working on it for the past month. my plan has been to release it on substack (already have one, it seems the easiest) but aesthetically i like the idea of a minimalist personal site...

2022-08-31 at 17:16:21: @christineist love! thanks u guys

2022-08-31 at 17:11:40: my poor homebody heart

2022-08-29 at 01:30:16: who knew preparing food for tonight and tomorrow would be the highlight of my weekend ☺️ having such a good time cooking!

2022-08-29 at 01:23:44: is there anything you can eat or drink to help stabilize blood sugar after ingesting too much sugar? my sugar threshold seems 2 be going down

2022-08-29 at 01:14:24: apparently the same is true of quinoa! alrighty, i’m cooking 1 cup dry chickpeas &amp; 1 cup quinoa now, let’s see how many meals they last me...

2022-08-29 at 01:10:52: google tells me my 1 cup of dried chickpeas will yield 3 cups when cooked. somehow i’m doubtful of a tripling in size, but we’ll find out in approx 1 hour

2022-08-27 at 21:48:01: @nowtheo i feel pretty good about that! i’d do well to remember it. resonates with other recent feelings of life being sacred in its every manifestation; and with my belief of inherent goodness/divinity

2022-08-27 at 21:34:08: currently living out “once you’re able to identify ego and experience being without it, how do you get yourself to do anything?”

2022-08-25 at 21:53:18: @smiling_for_fun didn’t get a notif for this 😤 what a lovely tidbit! thanks for sharing

2022-08-24 at 20:36:39: @infinitsummer when u feel disconnected then you become attentive to connection

2022-08-24 at 20:36:04: @infinitsummer yes!

2022-08-24 at 18:51:34: i’ve become much better at minimizing and mitigating my self-inflicted negative emotions, but i have no clear protocol on what to do when negative emotions arise from an interaction with someone else. anybody got resources/ideas?

2022-08-24 at 18:48:33: planning a roadtrip from the bay to santa fe for sometime in the next 8 months. i was getting hype about maybe october or early november, but honestly it might be too much of a hit to my momentum at work. so, spring it is i guess!

2022-08-24 at 18:45:32: @sweetfernery oh my goodness. sorry to hear this happened, glad you’re moving towards clarity

2022-08-24 at 18:24:27: you forsake part of your ego in exchange for keeping in connection. anything that gives us a foothold outside of the ego’s web of thought is a taste of what true, divine joy is

2022-08-24 at 18:22:59: because staying in connection keeps connection as the object of concentration

2022-08-24 at 18:21:49: as much as i don’t jive with contact improv, i have to admit they’re on to something with the “you always have to stay in connection” idea. bringing attention to staying in connection is such an interesting experience

2022-08-24 at 18:18:20: perhaps the dosha that is dominating at the time of my high experience determines / subtly affects the nature of the experience

2022-08-24 at 18:17:26: coincidently my cannabis experiences tend to be around that length from beginning to end, real end, when i’m back to ground state reality

2022-08-24 at 18:16:29: apparently different doshas dominate throughout the day, for 4 hour periods - kapha 6-10, pitta 12-2, vata 2-6

2022-08-24 at 01:22:30: just earnest-poasted in a put-together way on my realname acct and i have no idea how ppl are going to interact with it, if at all, but i stand by my tweets!

2022-08-24 at 00:40:31: i know how validating and nourishing it felt to read a spiritual book targeted to me (a woman). feeling the absence of that, if only i wasn’t hung up on it

2022-08-24 at 00:26:26: (3) his whole way of being, as documented in the gospel, is an affront to the rational mind. he is a wellspring from which spiritual truths flow. lots of what he says reminds me of koans - impossible to comprehend thru conventional rational / logical means

2022-08-24 at 00:24:00: frustrating cuz so much of it resonates - eg (1) he tells a disciple to stop instructing others on how to seek god and to instead pursue personally knowing God, (2) he says prayer, spirituality best done with a heart that longs for god - &amp; i know that longing now better than ever

2022-08-24 at 00:20:54: there’s a whole footnote a few pages in which takes the better part of a page to state that sri ramakrishna did not dislike women!

2022-08-24 at 00:17:20: rly digging the messages/ideas in gospel of sri ramakrishna but a little bothered by mental gymnastics to re-interpret his admonitions against ‘woman’ (which i know to mean more generally sexual urges / carnality)

2022-08-23 at 22:21:41: it was fine we just talked about running and his upcoming backpacking trip lol

2022-08-23 at 19:07:07: acute nervous system dysregulation today is affecting my motor skills / hand eye coordination

2022-08-23 at 03:49:55: lately i’ve been able to direct my actions / unify my parts with the collective goal of creating conditions for a calm mind

2022-08-23 at 03:47:10: well would you look at that i’m well and properly stoned

2022-08-22 at 22:53:55: oh i am just itching to start a new crochet project! it’s been a month or so of not crocheting. really captured by this granny square vest pattern here - what colors do you think could be good together? https://t.co/LlDNaIz7Gr

2022-08-22 at 22:41:09: @yokaihainen godspeed sweet hark

2022-08-22 at 16:59:36: actually the mysticism is a key ingredient hehe. so fun to learn about the variety and nature of mystical experiences - a potential map for the territory of spiritual exploration. also lets me appreciate my own mystical experiences in life thus far

2022-08-22 at 16:47:41: thought i wasn’t interested in history. turns out i needed to find the type of history that captured my attention &amp; sense of wonder - recently, i’ve been gripped by indian history with a touch of mysticism, particularly but not exclusively about women spiritual figures

2022-08-22 at 16:36:00: recently learned the lore of mirabai of the 16th century and feeling a draw to learn more about her. perhaps one way to learn is to try taking her image as my own, at least for a bit

2022-08-22 at 16:26:14: ohhhh btw i’m feeling a profile pic change coming on. just wanted to warn you guys

2022-08-22 at 16:25:47: something i’ve been feeling for the past few weeks is this sense of leaning into my inherent loveliness. i lean into it and feel my heart and experience and way of becoming, become sweeter

2022-08-22 at 16:14:18: this techno tune often plays itself in my head

2022-08-22 at 14:27:59: heading back home to the west coast, mom sent me off with a sindoor mark of the goddess, tuberosa flowers pinned in my hair, and three juhi jasmine flowers in my palm. heart full

2022-08-22 at 04:20:57: i’m currently working on some paperwork so school classifies me as a california resident... paperwork i’ve been avoiding for months. let a girl be sentimental as she pulls together her supporting documentation !

2022-08-22 at 04:18:33: at the time it was a crazy crazy thing for me to do and yet it felt like the only thing i could do. now it all makes sense. it was, as all things are, divinely ordained

2022-08-22 at 04:15:15: throwback to when i moved across the country on a week’s notice. good times

2022-08-21 at 17:26:17: mom reminded me today of the existence of jahnavi harrison - man is her voice sublime!

2022-08-20 at 23:16:59: @wholebodyprayer wow massive resonance with a recent conversation i had with ayurvedic practitioner in connecticut - he said meditation is not an action but rather a result [eg of a practice / behavior]

2022-08-20 at 21:08:49: visited local vedanta center today and had a wonderful time with a few deeply serendipitous moments. from this visit it became apparent to me that seeking initiation into a hindu sub-tradition is something i should consider more seriously

2022-08-19 at 14:17:02: @BenRatkaj enjoy the ride! :’)

2022-08-19 at 14:15:29: @willlowthewhisp 🥺🤍

2022-08-18 at 14:02:09: @pratibimbana grateful to have crossed paths with you!

2022-08-18 at 13:11:58: amtrakking thru the great state of new jersey as we speak

2022-08-18 at 04:32:48: experienced a summer thunderstorm this evening for the first time in forever. the sky darkened, the wind picked up, the torrential downpour began, and it was over in 40 minutes. afterward we went to the park and i couldn’t stop looking at the sky’s underbelly of clouds

2022-08-18 at 04:30:58: take me back to muir woods with my love!

2022-08-17 at 03:41:55: @wholebodyprayer good question. i lean towards it being a hidden universal urge but i am not sure

2022-08-16 at 22:36:43: apparently there is an indian adaptation of forrest gump that just came out a few days ago?

2022-08-16 at 12:41:58: on the first flight i challenged myself to read the first 20 pages of glass bead game; trying for another 20 on this next flight

2022-08-16 at 06:07:27: @br___ian u do have that many lifetimes tho

2022-08-16 at 04:49:49: yes the edible has started to hit and yes i am a page into a handwritten letter to my little brother (to be continued once i get my meal from mcdonalds, a rare treat and one of the few establishments open at this hour)

2022-08-16 at 04:40:48: get ready for delirious layover matilda. 11pm to 7am in denver baby

2022-08-16 at 04:35:48: i finally overcame this hurdle! my heart and mind melted together on to the page. bf is in for a treat 🥰 https://t.co/WA5VHA5DEw

2022-08-16 at 04:33:57: part of my cultivation practice is reading murakami bc he embeds who he is &amp; things i wish to cultivate in his writing. eg, the practice of letter writing! 

i just felt some wonderful letter writing flow, i’ve been wanting to experience this for a while, and here we are!

2022-08-15 at 17:33:17: spirituality helps us out a great deal. it gives us maxims &amp; beliefs that are eternal, which hold in the tide of transient thoughts

2022-08-15 at 17:31:43: this is what ram dass was talking about in ch 1 of paths to god. it’s difficult to release attachment &amp; to stay in a heart-place where you continually release attachment

2022-08-15 at 17:29:05: it is so helpful to feel less attached to thoughts as they arise; your free flowing mind can build upon itself and figure things out

2022-08-15 at 17:07:14: @flybottlemist i had no idea!

2022-08-15 at 04:46:30: just had fresh figs for the first time!

2022-08-13 at 19:48:30: @asbelcas this is insane!

2022-08-13 at 19:47:51: @asbelcas my goodness you have tremendous luck!

2022-08-13 at 19:46:20: initially i was convinced i had to get ddj400 but i might just get one of those ~$90-100 dollar things with mini turntables. i just wanna make fun mixes &amp; have a reason to listen closely to music &amp; dance

2022-08-13 at 19:45:08: yeah okay i might actually make it a goal to acquire some sort of dj equipment by the end of this month

2022-08-13 at 19:43:26: terrifying moment - almost put coriander into my cacao instead of cinnamon

2022-08-13 at 19:34:33: in order to enjoy alone time you have to feel that you exist even when you’re not around other people

2022-08-12 at 18:01:03: i wanna smell like sandalwood cinnamon and ginger

2022-08-12 at 17:55:31: @altsanabo abt to head into sf will report if weather is as nice in the city!

2022-08-11 at 17:06:19: @tasshinfogleman what are the different ways to build a personal website? i get stuck on: should i start with a google domain, another service, do i use templates or learn some CSS Javascript etc to build it more closely to my aesthetics

2022-08-11 at 16:49:35: the more you question your mind the less clear it becomes how to act

2022-08-11 at 09:03:45: @embryosophy hey buddhi &lt;3 keepin u guys in my prayers

2022-08-11 at 01:21:26: @myceliummage i am not sure i can ask

2022-08-11 at 01:02:15: @myceliummage her take on adderall: “it’s good until it isn’t”

2022-08-11 at 01:01:57: @myceliummage my friend quit cold turkey after some scary nosebleeds &amp; a panic attack

2022-08-10 at 21:29:35: i &lt;3 my wfh wednesdays

2022-08-10 at 21:20:18: that local anesthetic tho... that shit makes me loopy. wild to feel my body shaking in the dentist’s chair under the anesthetic body load

2022-08-10 at 21:19:38: root canal done this morn! wasn’t too bad. ironically i feel better about my dental health now than ever before in my life. i got dis shit under control. hopefully no more root canals!

2022-08-10 at 05:08:55: @nikitanomo do the bare minimum night time routine! brush n floss at the very least

2022-08-10 at 02:03:57: @alex_here_now aw sending love alex, you will find your way back before you know it 💛

2022-08-10 at 02:01:24: @nickcammarata @MasterTimBlais as per this tweet why does unclenching lead to lower res / “worse experience”? i’d assume that if you unclench the tension that is the ego it would make for a better experience? (not disagreeing, just clarifying) https://t.co/2Xf4mxp0yx

2022-08-10 at 01:55:05: @nickcammarata @MasterTimBlais tho i would say my ego is still around most of the time &amp; i am learning so much from handling little affronts to my ego. maybe stream entry is a stage that’s a little further along, when ego is even more quiet?

2022-08-10 at 01:53:35: @nickcammarata @MasterTimBlais oh i guess i should clarify i mean capital s Self as something like IFS Self / the higher divine Self within each person

2022-08-10 at 01:52:14: @nickcammarata @MasterTimBlais “un/clench” isn’t quite my experience but i think it maps onto this feeling i’ve had of Self rising from the ocean of consciousness that is my mind. Self has resolved ego tangles easily - tells them to dissolve back into the ocean &amp; they just do

2022-08-10 at 01:45:09: @nickcammarata @MasterTimBlais wowow ok i didn’t realize that this was stream entry. excited i’m finally coming upon it (interacting with my ego in this way) in my experience

2022-08-10 at 01:42:43: @sunofdopamine thank u for writing out these examples 🙂

2022-08-10 at 01:40:16: @sunofdopamine that makes sense! how does one go about surfacing these parts? what are clues to look out for?

2022-08-10 at 01:38:56: just got home from work and there’s a peaceful, loving feeling in my chest

2022-08-10 at 00:52:20: @sunofdopamine how interesting! my first response is “i don’t think i’m afraid to get things i really want”... does the book (or you) have examples of ways we get in our own way like that?

2022-08-10 at 00:37:34: the concept of ego didn’t mean much to me until something clicked a few weeks ago. that being said, i now feel comfortable divulging that i have no feeling for what shadow work / my shadow is. what made it click for you?

2022-08-10 at 00:08:50: @carmenleelau reminds me how friggin good my morning oatmeal tastes after a sit

2022-08-09 at 04:04:52: make memories you will cherish 🥰

2022-08-09 at 02:31:58: recalling an early childhood memory of being at the clinic and fighting against the drowsy tide of benadryl

2022-08-09 at 02:29:05: @noampomsky ohhh my gosh 😍

2022-08-08 at 19:13:38: @sweetfernery SEO queen! 👸

2022-08-08 at 18:07:33: if you haven’t had dental nerve pain before let me tell you it is a trip. referred pain, radiating pain, waves of pain

2022-08-08 at 18:06:21: at home today, took a sick day because of some gnarly tooth pain. getting checked out at the dentist this afternoon, hoping for the best, prepared as i can be for the worst

2022-08-06 at 19:47:42: @nickcammarata bf “thinks and feels more clearly under cloudy skies”, ideally ones that are threatening to rain or foggy. i had no idea what that felt like until a week or two ago

2022-08-06 at 19:46:52: @nickcammarata i remember being amazed by this belief. i am mid 70s all the way

2022-08-06 at 02:58:23: imma wear it with my birkenstocks tho

2022-08-06 at 02:54:49: fuck if i can find it and if it feels right when i put it on, i’ll put on my sexiest dress for this airport trip 🙈

2022-08-06 at 02:32:04: @bit_christ no i demand earnest poasts!

2022-08-05 at 23:45:48: less! than! 4! hours! until bf and i reunite!

2022-08-05 at 22:32:43: @moothought amen

2022-08-05 at 19:40:48: @the_wilderless not sure if this is your speed but i’d probably get stoned and do something i enjoy for a few hours

2022-08-05 at 16:40:23: @br___ian mine:
930-1030 commute in
1030-1 prep cells for imaging, squeeze lunch in (getting burrito today!)
1-2 image cells
2-3 meeting w advisor
3-4 cell maintenance work
get home by 6ish
b4 7 stop by cvs, then trader joe’s

2022-08-05 at 03:34:26: @eIfcup where did u buy from? i should get some

2022-08-05 at 03:34:08: @eIfcup yesss i love this trick

2022-08-05 at 02:50:56: @philipggarland haha i should say “a little more empathetic”

2022-08-05 at 02:46:03: a lie from childhood is that synesthesia is binary - ie either you have it or you don’t. i think everyone can have synesthetic moments!

2022-08-05 at 02:41:47: today i am being reminded of how i should reach a little further in my interactions with those i care about, reach to be a little kinder, empathetic, warmer

2022-08-05 at 01:50:55: @nat_sharpe_ (it’s a relevant model system for some of the research i do)

2022-08-05 at 01:49:55: @nat_sharpe_ i &lt;3 dicty too!

2022-08-03 at 05:35:34: @DiamonDie well yes my hope is not to understand rationally

2022-08-03 at 05:17:47: (2) ram dass writes that we can be preservers of love and beauty but that we must also be able to look at the destruction of love and beauty and say “yeah, that’s divine too”

that’s shiva - chaos, destruction of illusions

2022-08-03 at 05:14:48: there are two spiritual tenets i’ve been pondering recently &amp; realizing my rational mind can’t make sense of

(1) how can we love everyone? everyone, indiscriminately? ie “we are counseled to love others, forgive them, and extend endless compassion”

2022-08-03 at 04:59:17: reached out to my friend this morning and at his suggestion we just had dinner and it was really good. just what the doctor ordered https://t.co/BIUszATlod

2022-08-01 at 02:12:39: 10% chance i’m social pressured into partaking in mind warping substances tonight

2022-07-31 at 04:49:04: taking a shower now after a long day and letting out sighs of contentment

2022-07-31 at 04:24:15: i keep craving the sandpaper of everyday life to rub myself against &amp; become smooth

2022-07-30 at 17:50:45: twitter is documentation of my unfolding

2022-07-30 at 17:39:27: bruh why is having a morning routine soooo grounding. unreasonably high emotional returns on making sure i do a certain set of activities before attending to the day’s duties

2022-07-30 at 17:37:27: better to believe this than to beat yourself up for not communicating exactly as you’d like

2022-07-30 at 17:35:34: the way my mind is comes out in how i text people, how i communicate

2022-07-30 at 17:31:05: i get to help a friend move today! 🥳

2022-07-30 at 14:19:44: @nickcammarata hmm i think i’ve been getting more sensitive to weed as of late

2022-07-30 at 14:12:12: i spent a good hour curled up in my friend’s bed under her covers with bf on the phone, trying to feel alright while wave after headspinning wave rolled through my head. this may have been the first time bf witnessed me “too high”

2022-07-30 at 14:08:22: okay i made it through thanks for being on this journey with me

2022-07-30 at 07:11:03: :’/

2022-07-30 at 07:10:39: i am extraordinarily high right now, higher than i’d like to be. i know it’ll get better but it’s pretty intense right now

2022-07-30 at 06:14:47: guess who’s currently seventh wheeling lmaooo

2022-07-30 at 03:57:37: @br___ian v nice. excited to see u tm!!!

2022-07-30 at 01:30:20: people in my lab are really open to talking about the way that doing science *feels* and i really appreciate that

eg the way you feel after a meeting with your advisor; the way you feel the first time you try a technique for perturbing cells

2022-07-30 at 01:20:07: @relic_radiation contact improv isn’t really my thing but this is SICK

2022-07-30 at 01:16:54: hack for figuring out what to gift someone: instead of thinking nebulously about “what would they like”, think instead of the common interests / passions you have. what could *you* gift them?

2022-07-30 at 00:40:34: @empathy2000 very cozy 🥺

2022-07-30 at 00:12:37: @_holyweather omg! when was your last haircut?

2022-07-30 at 00:12:21: can you guys think of anything you’d feel more strongly at a lower dose?

2022-07-30 at 00:07:53: hi friends how’s your friday evening looking

2022-07-29 at 07:08:37: bf read some recent writing of mine and said that one part helped him deeply understand what it was like to be me, solitary, living my life in the bay and feeling yearning towards him

2022-07-29 at 06:51:20: i think it’ll be perfect accompaniment to my intended next substack post

2022-07-29 at 05:15:16: @forshaper i thought that might be the case but didn’t want to assume! excited for you to connect with this part of yourself

2022-07-29 at 04:56:54: @forshaper wowww i love the premise of this thread! when was the last time you were in india?

2022-07-29 at 04:56:12: @nomanautomata @peachblvd makes total sense 😄

2022-07-29 at 04:55:43: recently it’s been feeling really grounding to look at / interact with my reflection in a mirror! i can tell her how proud i am of what’s she’s done, she can bring me back to this physical body when i’ve gone astray

2022-07-29 at 04:44:52: @nomanautomata @peachblvd i kinda love cooking only one day in advance - eg dinner and leftovers the next day. i find i get really bored of food if i have it &gt;2 consecutive days

2022-07-29 at 04:32:07: @br___ian i mean if my thesis ends up involving modeling we’ll just find a collaborator to outsource it to aha

2022-07-29 at 04:31:38: @br___ian mmmmmmm maybe with some refreshing of memory but i have no interest in doing anything mathematical unless i absolutely need to

2022-07-29 at 02:12:16: @br___ian i do STEM and woo but how could u come for my mathematical achilles heel like this

2022-07-29 at 02:11:41: @br___ian i feel personally attacked

2022-07-29 at 01:30:42: @myceliummage i literally don’t even think about the goodness i just write and occasionally marvel at what made it into the last sentence just cuz i let my mind be and express itself

2022-07-29 at 01:29:56: @myceliummage recently i’ve optimizing for trying to get pure mind onto the page. channeling my mind onto the page. slowing down my thoughts so it’s just one thought at a time transferring to what i’m writing. often in the thick of it i feel moments of no thought at all and those r nice

2022-07-29 at 01:27:48: @sashachapin excited for more info! @myceliummage convinced me i should submit an entry

2022-07-29 at 01:10:09: @br___ian @christineist @_inju the beard’s coming back!!!!!

2022-07-29 at 00:59:39: @pratibimbana i kinda been feeling like the harmoniousness wears off around lunch/early afternoon and i have to renew it / pacify my mind again

2022-07-29 at 00:58:19: @pratibimbana can’t believe i feel so grounded and harmonious thanks 2 dinacharya

2022-07-29 at 00:57:21: @pratibimbana bruh i’ve been thinking about this tweet ever since i saw it. can’t believe i get to wake up and start anew every day with dinacharya

2022-07-29 at 00:37:12: increasing ur eudaimonic happiness increases ur hedonic happiness baseline!

2022-07-28 at 21:49:36: @bitsurprise no regrets tho i like feeling crazy sometimes

2022-07-28 at 21:49:03: @bitsurprise my last run this week was the complete opposite. i experienced moments of total oneness with the experience of running. this time i sure was experiencing a lot of things but oneness was not one of them

2022-07-28 at 21:45:29: @bitsurprise usually an ease sets in at some point. it varies, sometimes earlier on, sometimes later. this time there was no ease. frankly i had no business running so soon after eating and my body let me know as such. some cramping, an acid reflux esque feeling. but i kept going

2022-07-28 at 21:42:47: @bitsurprise normally the first block or two feels great and then a few blocks later i start to feel the lactic acid burn in my calves and i’m like alright here we go, here’s where it begins. that much was the same

2022-07-28 at 21:40:58: @bitsurprise i almost feel like i’m buzzing. i start running far too soon after my last meal but i don’t care because i need this run. i’m mapping the first few minutes of this run to runs prior and it doesn’t take me long to realize it’s different this time

2022-07-28 at 21:39:19: @bitsurprise it’s the mania that gets me out of the door in the first place, an underlying desperate energy that won’t let up until i give in and go

2022-07-28 at 21:35:16: twitter do be my journal fr

2022-07-28 at 20:16:04: @myceliummage also i’m not entirely clear on how this happened but i’ve written 3000 words today

2022-07-28 at 20:12:13: @altsanabo aw amazing!

2022-07-28 at 19:43:26: @myceliummage yup i’ve been putting apples or pears in first, softening ‘em, then i add a mashed banana for creaminess, then the oatmeal. it’s hella nourishing

2022-07-28 at 19:42:21: had a wild morning, now to sit outside and mindfully eat my burrito. nothing else i’d rather be doing!

2022-07-28 at 16:55:16: these days i am doing the best i can every day &amp; am happy with how my knowledge is progressing &amp; deepening 😌 https://t.co/TkYJqpGLNf

2022-07-28 at 15:02:16: @myceliummage reporting for duty... it’ll be done in 6 minutes https://t.co/Lb3uJzkXe3

2022-07-28 at 03:48:18: the more i understand my mind and how to harness / work with it, the more i think magic is legit

2022-07-28 at 03:42:21: the only thing i forgot to pack for my night out was my pepper spray!

2022-07-28 at 03:38:45: is it acceptable for a hindu with an appreciation of christianity to wear earrings with virgin mary iconography? please advise gently!

2022-07-28 at 03:36:21: weather has been ridiculously variable in berkeley in a way that really affects me lol. super cloudy in the morning until 11am today, gorgeously sunny all afternoon and until 7 at least. now it’s ultra cloudy again! it was sunny 2h ago!!

2022-07-28 at 03:34:08: today i went on a ridiculous manic fever dream of a run and wrote a sentence or two about it, revealing more of myself than i normally do. and guess whose kudos rolled in first? bf’s brother.... i see u! u see me!

2022-07-28 at 03:32:36: bf generally gives me kudos (the equivalent of a like) on my runs. bf’s brother is more sporadic with giving me kudos

2022-07-28 at 03:32:01: i only have two followers on strava, i keep it like that, one is bf and one is bf’s brother

2022-07-28 at 03:29:37: so in a classic instance of life (karma’s ripples) having different plans for me than the ones i intended: 

thought i was gonna be deeply introverted and read papers tonight but instead two spontaneous friend hangouts are happening!

2022-07-28 at 03:23:21: taking a big risk and opting for a tight pants + big shirt look instead of a loose pants + tiny top look !!!

2022-07-28 at 03:21:50: let’s see if i can do even better tomorrow when i’m under the time pressure of preparing for a progress meeting friday 😅😅😅

2022-07-28 at 03:19:08: transient discomfort in our relationships is what spurs us to be better! // how can we communicate better, to mitigate this discomfort?

2022-07-28 at 03:16:22: still a baddie tho

2022-07-28 at 03:16:07: for anyone wondering why i started out so slow it’s because i’m SHORT !

2022-07-28 at 03:13:05: i’m really happy to have gotten my running pace from 12:26 min/mi to 10:03 min/mi :D

as bf pointed out, that was murakami’s pace of choice - 10 min/mi

2022-07-28 at 03:09:04: crazy that u connect to ur bluetooth speaker by sending invisible waves between ur phone and the speaker.......,,,,,,

2022-07-28 at 02:48:27: into the core of life

2022-07-28 at 02:48:00: continuity is how you reach deeper

2022-07-28 at 01:14:23: lol this kind of feels like an amazing opportunity to go for a run (was planning to anyways) and see what it does for my emotional state

2022-07-28 at 00:40:57: could’ve just had a peaceful hang with an old friend but i felt the need to articulate something that bothered me in our conversation! and then we didn’t have the time to properly talk it through

2022-07-28 at 00:39:08: halp i’m in acute emotional discomfort (it’ll pass)

2022-07-27 at 19:53:40: @allisonwilens That could be very fun!

2022-07-27 at 18:53:42: settling into a few hours of reading papers, trying to find specific bits of knowledge in textbooks, and synthesizing info towards experimental planning. let’s see how i feel on the other side!

2022-07-27 at 03:13:12: @Lan_Dao_ cuuuute 💖

2022-07-26 at 17:16:03: we must release attachment to doubt; we must allow doubt to pass (because it will if we let it!)

2022-07-26 at 06:30:21: fruit fasted last saturday and i loved how hyper aware i was of how different foods affected me. i don’t think i’ve ever appreciated half a pear as much as i did that early afternoon. that half pear was salvation

2022-07-26 at 06:12:51: july vibes https://t.co/fQ5LG5rP7w

2022-07-26 at 03:38:16: @waxingarcane thank you for your response - i’d be happy to discuss further in replies/dms :)

2022-07-26 at 03:37:44: @waxingarcane i wouldn’t want to be in a group of people dealing with my exact issue / close to it; i’d like to be in a ~women only group; a group that lined up with hindu spiritual practice would be lovely but i think unlikely to exist

2022-07-26 at 03:34:21: @waxingarcane nothing in particular! i’m managing a quasi-chronic illness (long term effects of childhood illness) &amp; spiritually align with hinduism/a dash of zen

2022-07-26 at 03:32:13: went on an evening run, cloudy skies and breeze made for perfect running weather. feelin v proud of myself for going :)

usually it takes a couple blocks, even the first major road crossing, for the run to feel cognitively easier. but today it felt easier quite early on

2022-07-25 at 20:10:43: can any bay area friends point me to existing women’s circle type groups? my primary goal is to find social support for health

2022-07-24 at 23:55:33: @Prigoose 🤍

2022-07-24 at 21:27:36: the first time i listened to maggie rogers’s album “heard it in a past life” i was in the last few hours of an acid trip, cleaning the second floor bathroom in my sf group house. i shut the door as i cleaned and by the end of the album i was sobbing

2022-07-24 at 18:46:32: @nvpkp natalie goldberg is also a friend but more like an older wiser friend

2022-07-24 at 18:45:37: @nvpkp steinbeck has been this for me

2022-07-24 at 18:43:18: for real though i feel like energy gets stuck in nooks and crannies of my mind and body, and it sits there and festers. stagnant energy starts to hurt

2022-07-24 at 18:40:45: this experience may have singlehandedly convinced me that a pre-bedtime meditation/grounding/journaling practice is a good idea. not sure why i’m feeling such a backlog of yesterday’s feelings today

2022-07-24 at 18:38:05: a few hours into the day and i feel like i woke up crazy this morning

2022-07-24 at 03:05:18: jk i would never

2022-07-24 at 03:05:02: bf is offering to make me a battery powered taser, tempting tempting...

2022-07-23 at 21:46:48: @Prigoose i needed someone to tell me exactly this!

2022-07-23 at 21:28:09: what practice(s) can one begin with to develop one-pointed concentration?

2022-07-23 at 21:13:13: @noampomsky bf’s theory is that the rest of the season will be a continuation of ep 2....

2022-07-23 at 20:18:43: not sure what to do tho cuz i wanna post under ~realname but my audience is here

2022-07-23 at 20:08:37: not sure of exact timescale but ya girl will start using her substack again soon!

2022-07-23 at 19:29:24: @eIfcup those oat tops r beauuutiful

2022-07-23 at 16:52:37: @hormeze i’m doin this rn in my phd!

2022-07-23 at 16:44:32: have this little ego short circuit where i’ll be thinking well of myself for some reason &amp; then i start to feel bad that i’m feeling good about myself

2022-07-23 at 16:05:03: @eIfcup https://t.co/Zh7GFXVoCp

2022-07-23 at 16:03:37: @eIfcup i thiiiink in a good way. my cat can be a bit of a fiend, often going back for another nibble - must be good?

2022-07-23 at 04:25:31: i’d like to have some ritualized social cannabis experiences with friends who like weed

2022-07-23 at 04:00:08: @eIfcup and spider plant is psychoactive for them!

2022-07-23 at 03:59:43: @sashachapin to be clear i am very excited to read it &amp; perhaps you will address exactly this

2022-07-23 at 03:59:22: @sashachapin okay haven’t read it yet but i just get so suspicious of things that click in an instant. i mean, stuff does click, but how does it stay clicked after in everyday life?

2022-07-23 at 03:41:51: i’ve got some lofty post party goals tonight: hoping to journal and book flights for a visit home next month!

2022-07-23 at 03:26:12: no WAY i'm spending 23h at that airport... last time i had a very strange overnight experience there, stuck overnight after i missed a connecting flight. makes for a good story. i'd spend 23h at DEN tho! take the bus to boulder n back https://t.co/iUgvgaLLh8

2022-07-22 at 16:41:25: @donmexlar fav natural fragrances?

2022-07-22 at 15:44:41: my digestion is tremendously out of whack and has been for the past few days. never really settled once i got back from travels. well, ekadasi (4 days before new/full moon fast) is tomorrow &amp; it couldn’t have come at a better time!

2022-07-22 at 03:53:25: @danielthedaring reminds me of lyric - “people are places without a map”

https://t.co/bypfsVIaNV

2022-07-22 at 02:57:14: @ArtirKel @nickcammarata sweet nick what did you reply, i can’t see it

2022-07-22 at 02:47:53: tipsy walkin in sf, fog rolling in, listening to techno

2022-07-21 at 05:35:12: meanwhile i made this bomb ass quinoa salad with sweet potato, corn, black beans, dressing (next time will add avocado and could even add blue cheese!) aaand baba ganoush from scratch

2022-07-21 at 05:27:48: bf fried ground beef in butter, ghee, AND olive oil to make burger patties....... then put that on a pretzel bun with spinach, onion, mayo made with olive oil not soybean oil, and cream cheese......

2022-07-20 at 22:51:22: @Lan_Dao_ oh my lord what great candles

2022-07-20 at 22:16:25: @zencephalon tidy all the way! feels more quaint

2022-07-20 at 17:10:49: been in a down headspace for past couple days, when it’s like this i often feel as though i am making no forward progress. however, i did level up my breakfast-making abilities! i discovered warm fruit porridge and it’s so lovely to make &amp; consume

2022-07-20 at 16:07:24: may my uncertainty, held with grace, give rise to conviction

2022-07-18 at 19:58:46: would be fun to plan a psychedelic-journey-optional cozy sleepover

2022-07-18 at 19:22:06: now that i think about it he was the one who insisted i get out of bed!

2022-07-18 at 19:18:08: every tweet bubbles to the top of the collective conscious for but an instant

2022-07-18 at 19:15:47: would you wear spanx under your wedding dress?

2022-07-18 at 19:08:32: even bf can only offer so much support; the main support i need is from female friends [who are close by]

2022-07-18 at 19:07:32: there’s one area of my health i’m trying to get a better hold of &amp; it’s occurred to me that i don’t have enough people i feel comfortable talking to about that part of me

2022-07-18 at 18:59:10: genuinely think my cat can sense my mood is a little down, he keeps meowing at me and socially engaging me more than usual

2022-07-18 at 18:26:26: @hormeze ! hope to cross paths with you soon

2022-07-18 at 05:50:02: time (you and i) https://t.co/J7DiFhUtFN

2022-07-18 at 01:29:10: omw to a concert and forgot my earplugs, hopefully i’ll manage

2022-07-18 at 00:20:38: did some writing, then started to get anxious about the next time i sit down to write. what will i write about? what is worthwhile to write about? but that’s not my task to worry about. next time i sit down to write, my task is to allow the divine to move through me

2022-07-17 at 19:07:54: the thing about summer in berkeley is that the crispness of the wind makes it feel like autumn

2022-07-17 at 08:40:04: @xiexiexiexiex is censoring me as we speak!

2022-07-17 at 05:46:22: if this body is where i hold worry about the future, may i strengthen and equip this body as best i can

2022-07-17 at 05:14:03: the sooner you move here the sooner i can start to care for your body

2022-07-17 at 04:47:39: @sweetfernery so cute! i love how your hair drapes the sides of your face

2022-07-16 at 20:47:28: @goblinodds i kinda wanna buy them now 😭😭😭 despite your warning

2022-07-16 at 19:57:10: @TheGrandBlooms so cool! i'm just starting to get into obsidian. how did the labels appear on the graph? are those tags?

2022-07-16 at 02:04:07: my cat as of late https://t.co/yngF7xBaQl

2022-07-16 at 01:39:36: when we procrastinate, we think we enjoy not doing the task but in reality we are trying to avoid emotional pain!

2022-07-16 at 01:15:54: you guys aren’t ready for my yarn drawer photo content

2022-07-16 at 01:06:55: @gptbrooke omg i remember when you first arrived! you had a diff username at first iirc? but i can’t remember what it was!

2022-07-15 at 22:59:35: isn’t it magical how even a single sentence from a book can profoundly impact a person?

2022-07-15 at 20:24:57: practices of all sorts offer you a path to return to what is eternal within you

2022-07-15 at 19:40:55: wonder if dalle will cause / correlate with an increase in art with 3d media, because AI cannot yet create in 3d

2022-07-15 at 18:18:44: @br___ian @MasterTimBlais don’t forget when you replied to my mathematical modeling tweet way back when! to anyone reading this, let it be known that brian is a differential equations wizard

2022-07-15 at 18:13:36: @quistydotquist ah! if i had seen this around then, i might have had something to say. did you have a distinct new moon experience?

2022-07-15 at 18:12:29: @quistydotquist this connection makes me feel alive and touches something deep within me. this is what life is about, i feel. i treasure this connection, don’t know how i’d live without it, but i know transience is the name of the game

2022-07-15 at 18:10:58: @quistydotquist honestly this makes me think of my relationship with my grandparents &amp; to some extent, my parents too. i feel as though i’ve finally started to connect more deeply with my grandparents (due to new common interests &amp; maturity on my part) &amp;

2022-07-15 at 18:08:21: @pratibimbana i am more than happy to look up tirodhana and anugraha, but if you feel inclined to explain those concepts that would be much appreciated!

2022-07-15 at 18:05:18: @tasshinfogleman first off, i love this! second, seeing this framing makes me appreciate how in my work i am primarily guided by Curiosity, but how Love is abundant &amp; plays a role too. relationships with others truly are of the utmost importance!

2022-07-15 at 18:02:06: @danielthedaring ☺️. these are pretty striking! https://t.co/ZgZ11Oz317

2022-07-15 at 18:01:15: i love that so many of us have recently gotten access to dalle - i love seeing everyone’s creations

2022-07-15 at 17:54:07: in emotionally unpleasant moments, shaking it out and saying to myself, “this too shall pass”. a little levity arrives. 

in emotionally pleasant moments, smiling and saying to myself, “this too shall pass”. feeling the warmth of humor. this is the way it is.

2022-07-15 at 17:34:35: nobody tells you that you, not the doctor, sit in the driver’s seat when it comes to your health. ask questions, do your research, talk to your friends, advocate for yourself.

2022-07-15 at 17:32:04: genetics and chemotherapy have made me particularly unlucky with cavities. i still like going to the dentist though! this is because i found a dentist whose manner i love, and with whom i feel i can work with towards my dental health

2022-07-15 at 16:49:46: @pratibimbana 👀

2022-07-15 at 02:20:13: yesterday and the day before i reveled in sobriety: the clarity that deepens over time, the meaning and self-trust that arises from being with yourself unfettered experiencing the ups and downs of daily life

2022-07-15 at 01:55:37: my sincere apologies to those of you i get temporarily obsessed with

2022-07-15 at 01:06:11: @grantbels sweet grant

2022-07-15 at 01:03:14: finding myself enamored with hearing my writing voice; feeling once again the exquisiteness of words and perfect phrases. natalie goldberg writes that hemingway’s sentences were carried by long breaths

2022-07-15 at 00:34:53: @DarbraDawn just ordered a paperback copy, soooo excited!

2022-07-14 at 23:34:48: feeling so called to write, the feeling welled up and crested inside me. first time in months i’ve felt this!

2022-07-14 at 23:26:19: sharing this in case it’s relevant for any friends across the US! stay safe out there :) https://t.co/yAOgJ8TLc4

2022-07-14 at 22:39:22: some books take a while to get into. steinbeck’s travels with charley had me in its grasp by page 8

2022-07-14 at 21:46:26: my friend and i are discussing this on the phone and we’ve concluded cats can be vengeful, because vengefulness like anger is downstream of pain or fear; i maintain that cats simply cannot be angry at you, this is a human emotion projected onto a cat

2022-07-14 at 21:42:37: can cats be angry at their owners? 😾

2022-07-14 at 21:30:17: can cats be vengeful? 😸

2022-07-14 at 19:57:56: this canadian weed i got feels particularly psychedelic

2022-07-14 at 18:26:34: in addition to giving my friends little to no notice before swinging by, i also enjoy calls arranged on fairly short notice

2022-07-14 at 18:23:40: i love swinging by friends’ houses and so whenever i cross that threshold with a friend where i can just swing on by, it brings me a tremendous amount of joy. this tweet brought to you by a friend who told me to “stop by whenever”!

2022-07-14 at 18:13:19: * talked to in months

2022-07-14 at 17:46:41: have a phone call catch up scheduled for later today, with a friend i haven’t talked to months - maybe more than a year! 

i came across her capstone project recently and was impressed; i can’t waaait to tell her how proud of her i am!

2022-07-14 at 17:34:43: @captain_mrs finding the words to ask for the help you need from a person who can provide it ... feels so good!

2022-07-14 at 17:24:02: @eigenrobot !!!

2022-07-14 at 16:45:35: i looked at photos from this trip on the flight back this morning and my eyes looked so clear &amp; alive. i was feeling things deeply

2022-07-14 at 02:02:39: action is as intuitive as breath when the clinging mind releases expectation &amp; allows it to be as such

2022-07-14 at 01:16:53: today i heard that sadhana can be a first name and i’m utterly and completely enamored by the thought

2022-07-14 at 00:01:03: honestly peter attia is really great at this. maybe i’ll revisit some of his podcast episodes while i’m in this phase of figuring out the starting point of my thesis work

2022-07-14 at 00:00:12: i wonder where pursuit of basic biology meets pursuit of health

2022-07-13 at 17:51:06: 1./cont’d femininity, and living the care required for long hair.

2. related, a growing experiential understanding that for things we aspire towards we have to show up on a regular basis

2022-07-13 at 17:51:05: we are now onto the third time in recent years that i’m trying to grow my hair to waist length. i think this time has a high chance of success (!), thanks to:

1. a stronger vision of why i want long hair, which extends beyond me. it’s about connecting to family &amp; culture &amp;

2022-07-12 at 01:01:11: do i have any moots or friends who live in seattle &amp; might wanna say hi tomorrow?

2022-07-11 at 18:12:35: @allisonwilens i’m potentially down!

2022-07-11 at 07:53:54: (vodka and tabasco sauce)

2022-07-11 at 07:53:39: do you guys know off the top of your head what a prairie fire drink is

2022-07-09 at 21:14:25: riding BART really feels like getting an MRI sometimes, all those loud sounds and screeches in surround sound

2022-07-09 at 20:34:06: first time in a while wearing a fully packed backpacking pack, my hip flexors are like wuuuut is goin on

2022-07-09 at 18:21:33: @nickcammarata i think this was a well worded message with a kind but firm tone!

2022-07-09 at 18:20:14: (a human mind in contact with Divine Mind)

2022-07-09 at 18:19:42: bruh assembling a personal ontology as a scientist in training is no joke. you’re trying to assimilate an endless amount of information and see what unique insight your mind can gather by virtue of it being a human mind

2022-07-09 at 18:12:10: @suhlesst i’m about to go birthday shopping for a 10 year old girl! my game plan was a fancy journal, stickers, and some pens - scrunchies &amp; sunglasses are cute ideas!

2022-07-09 at 17:54:16: hoping to have 2-4 kiddos with bf one day in the future

2022-07-09 at 17:52:10: the only thing that will save you from transience &amp; that underlying harmonic drone of life’s currents is your ability to enjoy every moment as it comes

2022-07-09 at 17:14:53: @btohtoh 💛💛💛

2022-07-09 at 16:37:26: today i’m headed to a certain city in the western half of canada to see bf and meet two of his dear friends for the first time! 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦

2022-07-09 at 02:11:25: @altsanabo i should be in town ! 🤞

2022-07-08 at 19:34:59: just had a 1.5h meeting with a prof who’s been in the field for 40 years, i felt like i was drinking knowledge from a firehouse and it was exhilarating

2022-07-08 at 04:28:30: @eigenrobot bf has been doing so much soldering outside of fume hood, with proper ventilation, but just like ... hours and hours. hundreds of hours. i worry!

2022-07-08 at 04:24:10: should people who solder a lot wear some sort of mask to protect lungs? pls advise!

2022-07-07 at 23:29:39: another day spent pondering which frontier of knowledge i want to push outward

2022-07-07 at 21:59:50: @infinitsummer i luv evening runs

2022-07-06 at 23:50:58: just had a lovely visit to the herb shop! the attendant helped me figure out a tea blend to soothe + nourish my nervous system (tulsi, lemon balm, milky oats), plus i got mugwort + yarrow to help with dream work :)

2022-07-06 at 20:59:05: @embryosophy so, so sorry buddhi and hap 💔🙏🏽

2022-07-06 at 19:51:37: okay this woman says that oiling the inside of my nostrils (nasya) can help with breaths that feel shallow

2022-07-05 at 20:16:22: currently rebooting my science brain after a few days away

2022-07-05 at 19:03:32: perhaps if i adequately purify my subconscious, my dreams will guide me to what i should work on for my thesis

2022-07-05 at 06:39:50: @bunbury_exe @christineist omg me too what an honor

2022-07-05 at 05:01:43: an afternoon into evening in sf round up https://t.co/zI5pW4vAjD

2022-07-05 at 04:07:13: love and live for the pure expression of an exerted soul

2022-07-05 at 04:05:35: i love maintaining my friendships 🥰

2022-07-05 at 04:04:21: today i feel as though i’ve gotten everything i wanted - in part because i’ve been able to bear uncertainty and just be sort of flowy. less attachment, leaning into the direct experience of each moment

2022-07-05 at 04:02:08: just hit up a lab mate who lives near golden gate and had an impromptu chill at his place! so fun seeing him in his natural habitat

2022-07-05 at 00:57:06: @er1enney0ung gurl send me biology textbook shit whenever i’m down

2022-07-05 at 00:12:39: we played badminton and we managed a 15 hit volley and then i collapsed with joy and lay in the grass

2022-07-04 at 21:42:33: i forgot how insane the views are from random roads in san francisco. you’ll be chilling on the bus and look out a window and see a whole ass VISTA

2022-07-04 at 21:40:27: i was convinced i’d have to learn how to knit in order to make a sweater, but here i am 1/3 of the way into a crochet sweater that i adore already!

2022-07-04 at 21:20:36: oh my goodness. how could i have forgotten 2019.

2019 - less than a week into dating, bf and i decide to go on a LA to SF and back roadtrip up the 1 and back on the 5. who would have known i’d move to the bay! i remember being nervous we would run out of things to talk about

2022-07-04 at 21:14:23: fourth of july personal history thread:

2020 - flew to LA and started driving up with bf to move me to SF 🌉🎇

2021 - was on my first backpacking trip ever, 4 days 3 nights in shasta trinity alps. intense physically &amp; intensely beautiful. remote, couldn’t hear fireworks!

2022-07-04 at 20:36:35: remember @tasshinfogleman’s daily good night tweets? i think i’ll try them out for a bit...

2022-07-04 at 20:27:54: it’s gonna be hard switching from weekend vacation festivities chilling mode to the workweek tomorrow 😅

2022-07-04 at 20:06:32: although it’s a little far, i’m going to this picnic because it’s a chance to catch up with a friend who is like an older brother to me. there’s a two week window near the end of each year where he’s exactly 10 years older than me

2022-07-04 at 20:02:26: i’ve got a looong public transit journey ahead of me but i’ve packed everything i need to have a good time

2022-07-04 at 20:00:54: heading into sf for a fourth of july picnic which means i’m wearing a sweater and beanie and packing a windbreaker just in case

2022-07-04 at 07:21:05: @pratibimbana but a cardigan is in my future for sure. i’d love to see any patterns or designs or inspiration for one you might wanna make!

2022-07-04 at 07:20:14: @pratibimbana i strongly considered cardigan instead but a vision crystallized of a warm cozy sweater with a looser stitch - triple crochets. plus i was more familiar with the idea of a raglan and wanted to give it a try. and it’s SO satisfying!

2022-07-04 at 07:18:02: @pratibimbana this sweater project was a little unexpected and serendipitous! i had one WIP that i was stuck on and demoralized by, and had a bad start on another project (not ideal yarn choice)... and then i found 5 skeins of this interesting yarn at salvage store for $10 total

2022-07-04 at 07:15:37: @pratibimbana yesss i ended up going for 8 chains lol, a nice middle ground, and figured that (1) i’d probably want a looser fit, based on sweaters i’ve owned and liked; and (2), if too tight, i can block it once it’s done and stretch it out a little

2022-07-04 at 07:03:16: crochet, great british baking show, and decaf green tea with honey to unwind tonight

2022-07-04 at 06:44:51: i love explaining tidbits of things i know to demystify the world for others - my crafts, hobbies, field of study, etc. in moments of conversation i can pull the veil back for someone to understand something they didn’t know before

2022-07-03 at 23:26:54: video called mom and grandma just to catch up and of course we got to talking about crochet and they were sooo enthusiastic about my progress on the sweater ☺️🥺

2022-07-03 at 22:02:37: @sweetfernery &gt;:(

2022-07-03 at 21:38:53: @____keh they’re amazing 🐠

2022-07-03 at 21:34:06: @____keh keh i can’t believe you actually went thru with the slippers

2022-07-03 at 20:18:45: i love that i get to choose 😌

2022-07-03 at 20:18:23: can’t decide if i should chain 5 (tighter fit around arms/armpit) or chain 10 (looser fit) for the beginning of my raglan sweater sleeves!

2022-07-03 at 00:14:23: at oceanside feeling so deeply peaceful inside i almost cried https://t.co/zqFo4FgCxh

2022-06-30 at 21:55:34: @____keh omg hair LENGTH

2022-06-30 at 20:21:52: just stoned on BART thoughts

2022-06-30 at 20:14:18: i &lt;3 berkeley’s density level, where public transit is easy and fairly reliable or i can choose to use my car and not deal with crazy city driving

2022-06-30 at 20:09:56: thinking about reuniting with bf later today after 1month+ apart, deep breaths, brahmacharya, remember brahmacharya

2022-06-30 at 19:11:44: @pratibimbana somehow i feel like everything in our bodies (organs, muscle, blood, tissue) is pink

2022-06-30 at 19:00:15: when you are your attention, your awareness is like a beam of light shining: like rays from the sun feeding plants

2022-06-30 at 02:35:36: @sweetfernery haha i’d love that! 🤍

2022-06-30 at 01:28:56: @altsanabo this was my back up plan 🙃 any suggestions for a title?

2022-06-30 at 01:09:35: @tasshinfogleman aw it’s no prob we’ll chat soon. hbd friend ♥️

2022-06-30 at 01:04:14: anyone wanna hop on the phone and go for a little walk and talk in 15 min?

2022-06-29 at 21:55:28: just listened to a week-old voice memo with some lyrics i wrote over a backing track i made... i had filed that voice memo away in my brain as “lame lyrics, trying too hard, not authentic”

but holy fuck they’re really good lyrics, what was i thinking?!

2022-06-29 at 21:38:43: wow i am in dire need of some wholesome family time. good thing i get to hang with bf and his parents this weekend :)

2022-06-29 at 21:15:32: oh my lord i came across a guy doing amazing theory work for cell biophysics and my brain has just lit up in interest

2022-06-29 at 21:09:52: this has turned into “fuck it, i’m going to follow a bunch of random scientists who do work adjacent to my interests, let’s see if any follow me back” 😂

2022-06-29 at 20:57:50: let's see how long it takes to find a paper i'm interested in reading from my realname TL

2022-06-29 at 20:06:10: made some last night, i’m pleasantly surprised by the natural sweetness of red kidney beans! https://t.co/MpuYbytLRu

2022-06-29 at 04:34:44: @scifigreg to be clear it was terrible on all fronts

2022-06-29 at 04:34:22: @scifigreg my logic was everclear to get messed up asap, gatorade to... even out the damage? electrolytes?

2022-06-29 at 04:20:43: i’ve always been one for delayed gratification but i’ve gotten even more into it ever since i learned the niyamas literally say bearing discomfort is paying penance &amp; spiritually good for you

2022-06-29 at 03:57:17: if i could find a way to enjoy coming down (from feelings, from highs) i’d be invincible

2022-06-29 at 03:54:10: touched by the motif -

I lost all the pride
That I thought I could keep
Can you see me?
Say you feel me
It's a big world
But I fall at your feet
Reach out and touch me

https://t.co/ZNeQLn4Kwq

2022-06-29 at 03:35:39: i was on a walk last night and near the house where the old ladies sit out on their porch with their cats smoking weed - a house had put out a cardboard tray labeled “free - santa rosa plums”. and they are the sweetest plums

2022-06-29 at 03:32:55: he pointed out that the fruit gets more sour the closer you get to the pit

2022-06-29 at 03:30:32: @bunbury_exe duuude for real

2022-06-29 at 03:30:02: it’ll be like my parents and their fruit trees in every garden - fruit trees tell you reliably of the passage of time; it’ll be like the sweet plums my friend fed me from the tree right outside his north oakland porch

2022-06-29 at 03:28:26: hey when we buy land together, within our first year we have to plant a plum tree

2022-06-29 at 03:22:13: @sweetfernery remember that experiencing discomfort allows you to feel positive feelings more

2022-06-29 at 03:21:02: @sweetfernery relatable!

2022-06-29 at 02:01:17: remembering my everclear and gatorade college days

2022-06-28 at 15:49:02: sending lovingkindness to the authors of a terribly written review paper

2022-06-28 at 02:50:51: @nat_sharpe_ you know, same for my weekend!; sounds comforting; omg when abouts is baby due?

2022-06-28 at 02:47:46: @pratibimbana 1) brb looking up words. i think loquacious means talkative? ohhhh yes well that sounds wonderful :)
2) 🤯 upma + avocado???
3) 🥵💪🏽⚙️🌼!

2022-06-28 at 02:45:01: @rhymeswithvocal goat cheese is sooo good! and good food + friends is a blessed combination

love the trifecta of maxxing 😭

2022-06-28 at 01:51:05: how about a little mutual check-in ☺️

1) how was your weekend?
2) what was the best meal you had recently?
3) it’s summer ☀️! any feelings/aspirations/vibes for the season?

2022-06-27 at 19:03:14: 5 min from getting to lab &amp; getting to business but all i want to do is make silly little drum loops in ableton

2022-06-27 at 17:28:49: big day today. reseasoning my cast iron pan

2022-06-27 at 17:24:36: @moothought 🤍🤍🤍

2022-06-27 at 17:09:14: @aIt_cup bf and i hit 3 years in just a few days here 🙈 busy week!

2022-06-27 at 00:46:34: feel like a brand new woman now that i have food in my fridge

2022-06-26 at 22:25:53: @hormeze oh i’ve been noticing this with little hits of despair / irritation recently. let it wash over me and then away

2022-06-26 at 01:23:38: these are real scanning electron microscopy photos of the cilia in the fallopian tubes - colors added after. looks like veritable coral reefs https://t.co/wLXm7HkexI

2022-06-25 at 17:27:28: there is so much reading i have to do before a tuesday meeting but i am so enjoying the process of accumulating knowledge

2022-06-25 at 04:40:43: golden shadow of san francisco on the horizon https://t.co/JLfBJg3kYi

2022-06-25 at 03:37:23: okay maybe tmi but recently i’ve been experiencing an interesting qualium where i feel the up-and-down waves of life, of my relationship to work, my relationship to myself, etc - as gradual waves leading up to orgasmic crests

2022-06-25 at 03:04:50: @Caroline30 this is the first thing i’ve seen that has led me to reconsider ambivalence

2022-06-25 at 02:55:24: i bet there are jog wheel keyboard shortcuts. fo sho eq’ing keyboard shortcuts

2022-06-25 at 02:54:34: might fuck around and see if i can learn how to dj on literally just my laptop and mixxx

2022-06-25 at 02:48:15: wowww i love getting home when the sun’s still up

2022-06-25 at 02:35:47: @YouuTeee hiii i wanna dm you about your songs and covers but your dms aren’t open!

2022-06-25 at 02:30:31: man do i love living in the bay

2022-06-25 at 02:22:12: just out of beers with lab mates and now standing in the subway where it’s cozy and humid like the east coast and people are thrilling to be around

2022-06-25 at 02:16:42: pov: ur me, gawking at the skyscrapers https://t.co/SrDxTHidsm

2022-06-25 at 02:12:33: @virgo0namission did u make it back to the movie?

2022-06-25 at 01:58:47: reminds me of that shark tank episode where they had this pair pitching their company taking pets’ ashes and turning them into diamond rings, necklaces, etc. carbon to carbon, you know?

2022-06-25 at 01:57:05: would love to sample my car’s horn and put it into a song

2022-06-25 at 01:53:19: fun fact my 4-5x/week commute is 35 min walk + 35-45 minute bus ride each way. what’s urs

2022-06-24 at 19:22:25: vibessss rn https://t.co/QdkvMk8C1E

2022-06-24 at 19:21:41: phd status: i’m reading a lot &amp; talking to people about their work / the viability of my nascent ideas. it’s great fun! 

the synergy between reading papers (going inward, deepening my understanding) and conversing about science (externalizing ideas, creating rapport) is 🔥🔥🔥

2022-06-24 at 17:16:37: @fractal_person haha i was deciding between the two, opted for an obsidian + zotero situation

2022-06-24 at 16:28:48: looking ever so forward to some hardcore alone time this evening

2022-06-24 at 05:38:07: i think my next crochet project might have to be some room decor 😅 like some cute hanging “plants”

2022-06-24 at 05:31:26: @____keh i would consider! especially since i could combine it with a family visit. i’d be reluctant if it was super huge

2022-06-24 at 05:28:23: i can’t remember exactly the words we used but i recall this moment arising multiple times

mage: what if you were already Good?
me: [not able to comprehend]

2022-06-24 at 05:25:43: honestly a call with @myceliummage a while ago helped me See the distance i was mentally creating between my current self and my ideal “good” self

2022-06-24 at 02:20:49: was feeling out of it yesterday, on a call with bf i remarked, “i have to remember the happy, striving, good version of me is closer to current me than i think”

and here we are a day later, it’s played out, i’ve made it back to the happy flowing version of me

2022-06-24 at 02:02:51: today in the fever dream that is my running headspace i was waxing poetic about the slope of my outer thighs

2022-06-24 at 01:57:06: ridiculous how a mere 5 minutes into a run i’m admiring my shadow and loving my body

2022-06-23 at 17:34:59: @pratibimbana 🥺♥️

2022-06-23 at 17:33:48: when you lean towards the things that enable you to live life more fully - when you strive, bear discomfort, seek oneness - you align yourself with god’s love and god’s plan

2022-06-23 at 17:20:29: when we stop numbing ourselves we open ourselves to a greater experience of isvara-pranidhana

2022-06-23 at 17:05:56: generally when i sit down to write a love letter i lose steam a few paragraphs in &amp; look back and find what i’ve written a little insufferable

2022-06-23 at 00:01:27: picnicking with a friend soon and hopefully our conversation will help reinstate my scientific spark

2022-06-22 at 21:30:30: i’m on a bit of a quest to find my own Minimal Viable Music

2022-06-22 at 21:22:44: let me be clear i have no desire to be a part of his mountaineering trips... too hardcore 4 me

2022-06-22 at 21:20:58: gotta get fitter and fitter so bf and i can go on progressively more hardcore outdoors sojourns

2022-06-22 at 21:15:44: i think i need to spend some more intentional restorative time by myself &amp; need to set aside a few days to have only solo evening plans. realizing i’ve been feeling hella dysregulated

2022-06-22 at 21:11:23: two weeks in a row now that i’ve ended up with plans every night tues-sat. i’m grateful, just a little burnt out socially!

2022-06-22 at 21:06:29: chapter 1 of david byrne’s book on music made it clear to me that performance is a distinct part of the experience of music

2022-06-22 at 21:02:53: soon i’ll be setting up a tiddlywiki/obsidian situation for my phd reading and thinking!

2022-06-22 at 19:37:14: @profeshkitten @moonboi_ cute!!

2022-06-22 at 19:32:11: same friend says that the faster you respond to someone’s message, the more important/valued they feel https://t.co/udFH7wTjmO

2022-06-22 at 05:10:13: when i’m with you i feel like a child again

2022-06-22 at 01:45:40: okay so we know piezo1 needs to be activated for human neural stem cells to commit to being neural cells... but we don’t know how piezo1 gets activated [by forces exerted by the cell itself]. interesting &amp; sensical knowledge gap to go after https://t.co/Jjwjf0S9d0

2022-06-22 at 01:43:29: cells aren’t just poked, they can poke too! and don’t forget it: “cells use myosin-II generated traction forces for probing the stiffness of the ECM” https://t.co/zUV7oTPRXF

2022-06-22 at 01:38:57: apparently “the global knockout of Piezo1 is embryonic lethal” - i didn’t realize piezo1 was such an important channel! i wonder how ubiquitous it is across cell types/organisms. maybe there’s a frontier/niche in the current knowledge of piezo1 for me to investigate

2022-06-22 at 01:35:17: woah piezo channels are bioelectric? (i mean, isn’t every ion channel “bioelectric” in that it governs the flow of charge??? or maybe there’s a threshold you need to cross to be considered electric instead of just chemical) https://t.co/CdzbDbfkxH

2022-06-22 at 01:33:06: yay for mechanically activated ion channels! i’m newly appreciating the value of “spatial coding of mechanical stimuli”

(i imagine you lose some spatial coding if your mechanical stimulus [outside the cell] is encoded by a biochemical signal) https://t.co/JNeJq945DO

2022-06-22 at 01:27:13: lots of words here that are exciting but i don’t understand: i’m not aware yet that piezo1 exhibits calcium flickers; 

and what does it really mean for “channels to explore a large number of mechanical microdomains”? https://t.co/2HnLDGtNKf

2022-06-22 at 01:25:02: okay cool i like the value proposition, they’re going to show their system for controlling external force (easier to generate) &amp; probing solely cell-generated force (requires cleverer design to probe) https://t.co/8X9AfTElBP

2022-06-22 at 01:22:46: okay let’s go. stoked to learn about more about piezo channels, i’ve heard that they’re an area of study within mechanobiology, but don’t know much about how they work https://t.co/BxwY3GcpPg

2022-06-22 at 01:20:48: @embryosophy 😂😂🥵

2022-06-22 at 01:05:39: homegrown hits different

2022-06-22 at 01:05:10: formulating a plan to become friends with more weed growers so i can gift them crochet things, nourishing food, etc in exchange for cannabis

2022-06-22 at 00:59:20: we’re just a few minutes away from the first episode of “matilda blind reacts to a paper”

2022-06-22 at 00:52:09: plenty to unpack there. what’s the deepest experience you’ve had?

2022-06-22 at 00:50:29: i have a friend who is convinced that the deepest experience a human can have (or at least that he has had) is that of partner dancing

2022-06-22 at 00:48:44: please forgive me for not just googling this, can someone explain to me why birkenstocks / similar sandals are referred to as “jesus sandals”?

2022-06-21 at 14:29:36: 7:30 and i’m on my way into the city for a 9am meeting, meanwhile it’s drunk karaoke o’clock for bf in japan

2022-06-21 at 01:01:49: when you crave that trance-like state of absorption all you need is a way in

2022-06-20 at 19:46:47: ideally “productive” obsession rather than rumination

2022-06-20 at 19:46:16: have any suggestions for writing about obsession / that captures the spirit of obsession?

2022-06-20 at 04:37:22: it’s coming by thursday this week :)

2022-06-20 at 04:28:25: i wanna learn more silken tofu recipes... such an intriguing texture to work with

2022-06-20 at 04:10:28: guys i miss bf soooo much im feeling some strong things

2022-06-20 at 03:54:19: i’m crashing the boys’ trip to vancouver.....

2022-06-20 at 03:53:49: happy to be getting in touch with my artsy/creative side in advance of meeting bf’s creative friends from youth in a few weeks!

2022-06-19 at 19:57:55: the nighttime dance floor was a dream https://t.co/IP9o0n4PCw

2022-06-19 at 19:55:27: starting the drive back from a day and night of forest partying and maaan was that fun :’)

2022-06-18 at 18:26:38: in the mood to be alone but i have social commitments!

2022-06-18 at 02:19:09: are any of you going to be at aella’s dance workshop in berkeley tonight? 🙃

2022-06-17 at 22:52:10: @liekovarpio i hope one day to visit somewhere where the summer nights get that long - latest sunset i’ve ever experienced was right before 9pm

2022-06-17 at 18:02:55: @rhymeswithvocal @nat_sharpe_ ^^^ !!!

2022-06-17 at 17:56:10: my heart feels like a swirling pulsing vortex of love faith and connection, a portal straight to him no matter the distance

2022-06-17 at 17:53:47: i love him so much! i’m so excited for him to experience excitement and novelty and clarity 💛

2022-06-17 at 17:50:57: my other half is heading off on a 10 day trip to japan (!) as we speak and although i’ve been feeling bummed about not getting to join, my heart newly feels light. even though i’m not on the plane, it feels like we’re both setting off on an adventure

2022-06-17 at 17:39:39: this morning i’m remembering how much i adore techno

2022-06-17 at 16:38:54: @rhymeswithvocal @frances__lorenz hi frances!!!

2022-06-17 at 16:35:52: @rhymeswithvocal also we should actually make that call happen

2022-06-17 at 16:35:37: @rhymeswithvocal hai

2022-06-17 at 16:34:28: as i’m becoming clearer on the things i enjoy/find value in/want to pursue, it’s also becoming clearer to me how to use twitter as supportive community/“sangha”

2022-06-16 at 20:18:14: i just have so much respect for the more advanced grad students in my lab. the sophistication with which they talk about science is so impressive. and i’ll get there too!

2022-06-16 at 04:20:31: well i just unexpectedly found myself within 10 feet of ann shulgin

2022-06-15 at 20:20:37: coming to realize i need another shelf in my room. too many things here and there at present, and a shelf that comes up to somewhere between waist and chest height could be a surface for midi/synth

2022-06-15 at 16:35:15: striving for towards high moral/spiritual ideals requires resilience and self-forgiveness

2022-06-15 at 07:39:10: @yokaihainen yeah the power of analog electronics...

2022-06-15 at 07:33:48: bf is convincing me to buy a synth...

2022-06-15 at 02:38:07: crazy u can amplify enjoyment by leaning into it

2022-06-15 at 02:34:52: i could with not a ridiculous amount of effort get my keyboard skills up to a level where i could jam with others. that would be nice

2022-06-15 at 02:31:32: swear to god i’ve seen a disproportionately high number of people chillin in their cars today. what’s up with that. everybody need a breather?

2022-06-14 at 17:10:45: i’m in a good mood despite eating a starchy breakfast thing that tanked my energy. if i can do it you can do it too

2022-06-14 at 17:06:47: beautiful warm clear morning in san francisco, impossible to be in anything but a good mood

2022-06-14 at 15:31:33: @natural_hazard hi hazard! is there a piece of art/decor you’ve put up in your new place that you really like?

2022-06-14 at 06:24:34: mycharting my doctor for medical remedies, emailing the astrologer for remedies too. making moves to take care of my health

2022-06-14 at 02:28:50: you know you can take the energy you’re using to doubt yourself and channel that same energy into doing

2022-06-14 at 02:24:32: for the first time ever i can feel myself tapping into that full moon energy

2022-06-13 at 20:13:45: @christineist 😇 https://t.co/MnPYzsMNr7

2022-06-13 at 20:13:17: @profeshkitten 3/ increased sensitivity to my energy level &amp; impact of energy level on state of psyche

2022-06-13 at 20:12:42: @profeshkitten and food was taken with the intent to sustain and to protect from headache/excessive weakness

somehow when that coupled hunger-anxiety arose i was able to sit with it peacefully &amp; defuse the anxiety

2022-06-13 at 20:12:28: @profeshkitten 2/ normally starting to feel hunger can make me anxious, maybe because it’s coupled to increased headache risk &amp; concern about “how will i logistically feed myself”

when fasting, there was a small catalog of food to choose from (fruit, tapioca, no grain, no salt),

2022-06-13 at 20:10:41: @profeshkitten 1/ when talking on the phone with bf he said sometimes he notices when hungry, if he can sit through the discomfort for 1h then it’s fine after. so i tried that, and it worked. i feel more able to weather discomfort &amp; more willing to be patient with discomfort

2022-06-13 at 19:16:52: sautéed maitake mushrooms in ghee and the flavor results are incredible

2022-06-13 at 19:04:17: i fasted last friday and i think the experience of intentionally allowing discomfort (hunger) was a good thing for my psyche

2022-06-13 at 18:58:50: @Saurya 👀 i made upma saturday morning and it hit the spot https://t.co/brASOYkcbz

2022-06-13 at 18:26:25: @VCTRSCHMPN why avoid fitbit?

2022-06-13 at 06:51:13: @moothought mine is too 😅

2022-06-13 at 05:40:48: @yokaihainen :’’) thank you! means a lot

2022-06-13 at 05:19:39: something i made two weeks ago. sorry not sorry for the shite audio quality :’) https://t.co/UOX9vkW2u8

2022-06-13 at 02:03:19: it can be so hard to simultaneously hold the image of who you are right now and the image of what you would like to become

2022-06-13 at 02:01:53: seems like one way out of acute creative frustration is to re-immerse yourself in creative works you love

2022-06-13 at 01:27:18: i haven’t held a physical copy of science in years, the novelty is really doing something for me

2022-06-13 at 01:26:30: tomorrow’s morning commute reading https://t.co/d4pCUtLtDZ

2022-06-13 at 01:03:22: part of endeavoring to find the pursuits that fulfill each of us, is identifying and making peace with the “should’s” (i should do this because x) that aren’t serving you

2022-06-12 at 21:42:32: @kbala444

2022-06-12 at 21:42:17: feeling a little wound up gonna have some herbal tea with honey and watch hitomi’s newest video

2022-06-12 at 01:34:59: my friend leaves for barcelona tomorrow morning at 7am! can’t wait to catch up with him in a few weeks https://t.co/CpuwEAG4tG

2022-06-12 at 01:15:44: i see where this take is coming from; i do think surrogacy is a valuable option for women who are physically unable to bear children due to health issues (eg hysterectomy, cancer/its after effects) https://t.co/10Qza6WIoM

2022-06-11 at 22:56:54: @rhymeswithvocal amazing

https://t.co/Rt4LbVbMAm https://t.co/YfIGSKeMeM

2022-06-11 at 21:51:52: @_StevenFan excited for thread!

2022-06-11 at 20:57:45: @nickcammarata @RomeoStevens76 thank you for sharing &amp; for your perspective! 😊

2022-06-11 at 20:57:01: @nickcammarata @RomeoStevens76 the post had some parts that were particularly impactful for me - delineating reasons why letting yourself be happy and less neurotic is good, actually; and the carrot/stick explanation + question highlighted in screenshot https://t.co/juhHb3bXwe

2022-06-11 at 20:54:20: @nickcammarata @RomeoStevens76 that being said, the fact that core transformation is a process you can undertake during a meditative state, and it has effects that last at least a few days..... that’s insane. that sounds crazy powerful

2022-06-11 at 20:54:10: @nickcammarata @RomeoStevens76 i feel like in order for core transformation to work for me, i’d have to put a solid amount of effort into understanding focusing/other parts work concepts... and i  personally want to “spend” that effort pursuing the framework hinduism provides

2022-06-11 at 20:35:08: do you ever sit down to meditate and find you just can’t lengthen your breaths? like you know you can breathe deeper, but your body just isn’t letting you?

what’s up with that? posture? busy mind/tension in body?

2022-06-11 at 20:33:01: @nickcammarata @RomeoStevens76 okay gonna wade through blogpost now to wrap my head around core transformation

2022-06-11 at 20:30:56: @thevoidbeckon i seriously think learning to crochet &amp; the process of doing a project over time, stitch by stitch, has started to help me understand “appreciating the journey” while on the journey

all to easy to appreciate the journey after the fact, harder while you’re on it

2022-06-11 at 19:39:51: honest question, what paths can one take to unlearn this? https://t.co/OBuyk8rmVU

2022-06-11 at 17:32:59: crazy that you can just decide to do a thing, follow through, and magically create a pocket of specialness/meaning in your life

2022-06-11 at 08:02:29: i am deeply, pleasantly tired. i’ll cherish this feeling and get ready for bed. excited to wake up and break my fast with upma

2022-06-11 at 07:28:59: thanks to his words my thoughts more often slacken their grip and let me dwell in that sweet void

2022-06-11 at 07:26:27: murakami wrote that on his runs he doesn’t really think much of anything. he dispels the idea that mid-run flashes of insight arrive to him on the regular, and that instead he spends a good amount of time in a sort of void

2022-06-11 at 07:09:53: perhaps for my next coming of age rite i’ll learn how to make rajma https://t.co/dc6xtIdRir

2022-06-11 at 06:55:55: coelho seems to be fairly hit or miss for me. alchemist i couldn’t really get into, brida i think is amazing and deeply resonant and holds some eternal truths, eleven minutes i found underwhelming

2022-06-11 at 06:49:17: patience and presence, patience and presence

2022-06-11 at 06:46:55: but i can sense i’m on a trajectory to somewhere deeper.

2022-06-11 at 06:45:43: i think i’m in a come up stage of delving into faith. it’s a much slower come up. days, weeks, months, instead of an hour or so. lots of doubting and second guessing

2022-06-11 at 06:42:41: remembering that first come up that first time i dropped. it wasn’t uncomfortable; what i remember more are the feelings of “has it hit yet? am i making up what i’m feeling?”

2022-06-11 at 06:20:17: something compelled me to read about and take notes on the yamas and niyamas earlier this week, and every time i look over my notes i feel a blossom of positivity

2022-06-11 at 06:16:37: was going to come home and get right on with my bedtime preparations but it’s so nice out it reminds me of east coast nights and my heart wants to go on a long walk

2022-06-10 at 18:35:35: devotional music hits different on ekadashi

2022-06-09 at 21:47:56: @TheGrandBlooms impeccable

2022-06-09 at 16:12:00: @pratibimbana i spent much of undergrad thinking i could jump right into advanced EE courses without understanding circuits... “i’ll figure it out as i go, it’s like coding” (spoiler: not so)

2022-06-08 at 03:45:30: @pratibimbana is there a translation you’re partial to?

2022-06-08 at 03:16:28: @pratibimbana sending wishes of health and ease your way 🌿

2022-06-08 at 03:15:20: i’m also gonna try some salad lunches this week and see what i can come up with!

2022-06-08 at 03:13:09: it’s not really wool sock season but in a few months on an autumn camping trip i’ll be grateful

2022-06-08 at 03:12:42: i’m gonna start crocheting socks out of some scrap wool i have!!!

2022-06-08 at 02:29:35: @embryosophy perfect! do you have it a specific time after dinner / before bed?

2022-06-08 at 01:47:39: if you use triphala, how do you consume triphala on a daily basis?

2022-06-08 at 01:00:33: wish we were still in our hookah bar era

2022-06-07 at 21:09:41: i go back to work next week so have been tryna figure out good lunches to pack that will feel good to eat w/o needing to microwave

well you know how kitchari gets less fluid when you store it? i’m thinking i could pack kitchari and pour some hot water on it time of

2022-06-07 at 20:53:49: @algekalipso such a cool subtlety to point out!

2022-06-07 at 20:40:54: i love the fervor with which i fight, i love the fire it points to within me. i don’t like how much energy i expend rolling uncertainties around in my head

2022-06-07 at 20:38:37: @Probably_Brian brian. this is super fucking funny

2022-06-07 at 20:32:52: i keep on fighting against the way life is unfolding. i forget that life is unfurling in ways that are beyond my comprehension in this moment, even beyond what i’ll understand in the next few days or weeks

2022-06-07 at 20:30:00: luv putting sweet potato into my daals and kitcharis

2022-06-07 at 20:20:23: i think you have to remain open hearted and aspire to be clear minded and trust where you feel resonance (your capacity to feel resonance increases too)

2022-06-07 at 20:17:49: when ya wanna deeply attune but you don’t know yet what there is to deeply attune to

2022-06-07 at 19:53:28: manifesting a 2-3 year long post doc in europe after finishing phd... we’ll move there for a few years to experience that famed european quality of life and then we’ll move back to north america and settle down!

2022-06-07 at 02:43:11: wanna go to a german christmas market sooo bad

2022-06-07 at 00:25:49: @MCMCD_ mine and bf’s! https://t.co/zzSFKB7iZO

2022-06-07 at 00:18:17: how about that journaling by hand in flowy writing trance. words just be flowing out, no separation between writer and writing

2022-06-06 at 21:44:16: apple watch has been my plan, ideally used/refurbished, but wanted to check

2022-06-06 at 21:41:27: i’ve been wanting to buy a smart watch for a while, which one should i get? 

(i care about simple things - heart rate, exercise tracking, decent sleep tracking maybe)

2022-06-06 at 21:18:48: @PrinceVogel eastbay

2022-06-06 at 19:16:17: @pratibimbana going in the mail today 🥺 https://t.co/gCQ3VgXBLG

2022-06-06 at 04:59:24: @pratibimbana onto the next chapter and i’m impressed by the scientific sophistication + integration with more mystical concepts, 

eg pineal gland being for “smooth transition b/w different states of consciousness” and also for physical maturity/emotional stability https://t.co/87uLmDyUDP

2022-06-06 at 04:50:20: @pratibimbana i’m finding it really compelling so far :) https://t.co/UGLKaCIApy

2022-06-06 at 04:28:00: bruh. found a place with classes on my walk https://t.co/1R4UFyXfLb

2022-06-06 at 04:15:14: @kbala444 😂 very happy to have stumbled upon it!

2022-06-06 at 04:14:36: big “the universe is ready to provide serendipity and synchronicity and even meaning, you just have to get out there” vibes

2022-06-06 at 03:57:49: maybe i should just sign up for a month of carnatic voice lessons and see what happens

2022-06-06 at 03:55:46: does depth = meaning?

2022-06-06 at 03:45:22: @altsanabo ikr!

2022-06-06 at 03:43:13: @RomeoStevens76 hahaha yeah i’m stoked

2022-06-06 at 03:41:55: box of books on a berkeley curb // my haul https://t.co/K0agOuWNuz

2022-06-06 at 03:35:15: but y it be so hard to stick to one framework!!!

2022-06-06 at 03:33:56: i feel like there’s value to pinning your findings about the world into a specific framework - eg ayurveda, IFS, zen buddhist tradition, etc

it lets you tap into systems level thinking and lets you weave your understandings together: iteration, accumulation, refinement

2022-06-06 at 03:30:33: 20 minutes in and the clouds are hanging low over the berkeley hills in a gauzy way. the world feels bigger and i feel less significant

2022-06-06 at 03:18:52: i feel a breakthrough szn coming up

2022-06-06 at 03:08:39: guess who’s about to go on a long walk...!

2022-06-05 at 20:28:14: transient mood: why does it feel so hard to realign with [intrinsic] virtue

2022-06-05 at 08:32:28: @tasshinfogleman i was just thinking about the power of ‘ample time with friends of virtue’ !

2022-06-05 at 06:52:08: when you extract oil from say sunflower seeds, is that oil from the cell membranes (lipid bilayers) of the sunflower seeds?

2022-06-04 at 23:40:51: @pratibimbana eg i think my mom on her spiritual trajectory is on a path of slowly shedding worldly attachment. that’s not at all where i am afaict

2022-06-04 at 23:39:59: @pratibimbana wanna know more about how you conceptualize worldly involvement / the amount that feels right to you

2022-06-04 at 19:15:21: and the cycle repeats: i find a book i get completely absorbed in, i finish the book, i fall into a reading lull, bf gets back into reading and his enthusiasm encourages me back into finding a book i enjoy reading

2022-06-04 at 09:10:58: @pratibimbana SO cute!

2022-06-04 at 08:07:51: groooovy https://t.co/Pa7ErTzOoP

2022-06-04 at 00:32:21: i’m wearing the necklace out tonight, time to feel out its energy... https://t.co/KNHjztYXew

2022-06-04 at 00:29:09: i’m so excited to weave in samples from my environment into my ableton tunes!

2022-06-04 at 00:17:55: @christineist sent this to bf with caption 👀

2022-06-03 at 22:36:39: just discovered my roommate knows how to do tarot readings! she’ll do a half-year reading for me in a few weeks 🥺

2022-06-03 at 20:11:08: @nat_sharpe_ good luck!!! 🍀🍀🍀

2022-06-03 at 20:10:39: the resolution arose in a way that felt golden and liquid

2022-06-03 at 20:09:32: did sitting meditation for first time in a while today and at one point a resolution to an issue i’ve been contemplating just arose

2022-06-03 at 19:45:45: @Thinkwert @SatyreContraire incredible image

2022-06-03 at 18:46:46: listening to my little techno playlist attempting to make some bomb ass polenta

2022-06-03 at 18:20:07: today i get to have dinner with a friend i haven’t seen since february!

2022-06-03 at 18:12:13: @MCMCD_ !!! ♥️🌸💐

2022-06-03 at 02:48:39: i’m almost done, just have to add one more flower, i’m obsessed it’s turning out sooo cute

2022-06-03 at 00:27:37: okay! i am finally gonna do breathing exercises to help my recovery from respiratory illness!

2022-06-02 at 21:59:09: @pratibimbana 😭💪🏽 you dread it but then it feels so good to do it!

2022-06-02 at 21:15:10: @hormeze i will have to remember this the next time i feel like being high...

2022-06-02 at 21:12:04: finally weaving the ends in for a crochet project i did a month ago! https://t.co/snZcJj4nKl

2022-06-01 at 04:56:21: @jessicamalonso @christineist me too hey neighbor!

2022-06-01 at 03:50:31: @willlowthewhisp friends within walking distance, sunny and more-pleasant-than-sf weather, beautiful hills to the east, almost too many nearby spiritual centers, pleasant level of density (moderate), at once happening and quiet

2022-06-01 at 02:13:08: angel! baby! https://t.co/R2k90YRjMt

2022-06-01 at 02:02:17: @valor_zhang i’d be down; i’m not the most acquainted with rationality

2022-06-01 at 01:49:07: i’m thinking too hard about music rn to enjoy trying to produce it. so i’m gonna give my brain a break and crochet for an hour or two with the great british baking show in the background

2022-06-01 at 01:26:42: you gotta cross train, you know? runs, hikes, going out dancing, backpacking, yoga, pranayama

2022-06-01 at 01:17:10: have an idea for a crochet project gift for mom, have to start on it today to capitalize on my excitement! it’ll be a green cotton bucket hat with simple white embroidered flowers :)

2022-06-01 at 01:14:07: the snack game was on point. among other things they supplied cucumber mint water and homemade jam! i made fig-goat cheese-turkey-arugula sandwich bites :-)

2022-06-01 at 01:12:24: utterly dreamy picnic with the wonderful @Probably_Brian and @christineist yesterday! https://t.co/oxzuKvjvJD

2022-05-31 at 19:55:19: @embryosophy @Tjdriii @astridwilde1 yeah i wanna know too

2022-05-31 at 06:26:51: tomorrow’s ableton prompt will be trying to replicate elements of this song, and learning how to use reverb

https://t.co/Y3Hs70GPtF

2022-05-31 at 06:08:53: spent a couple hours making a little thing in ableton and i’m very pleased with it :3

2022-05-31 at 00:25:20: imma need to figure out some practices to reduce acute nervous system load (physical + emotional, mostly physical atm) so that nervous system load doesn’t flare up as tooth pain and other nerve pains

2022-05-30 at 23:44:42: if you have a strong, immediate, or deeply felt answer to this, it might make a good writing prompt for you :)

2022-05-30 at 23:31:24: which kind of light speaks deepest to you?

east - rising, morning, early, life giving, etc
west - setting, enduring, sustaining,  etc

2022-05-30 at 23:25:25: closeness with others is a great serendipity generator. stuff close to people’s hearts and cores has the ability to change and mold your heart too

2022-05-30 at 23:11:58: @pratibimbana dream combination. my aspiration

2022-05-30 at 23:11:27: internal trampoline that pushes back on my requests and asks whether they’re reasonable. sometimes i can get off the trampoline fast, easily: yes, this is reasonable, i feel solid. sometimes it takes a while to damp

2022-05-29 at 23:20:03: learning how to maintain and better your health over a lifetime = coming to reside in yourself

2022-05-29 at 20:25:53: @Maria_Pea_20 ah! the way everything’s blowing in the wind

2022-05-29 at 17:21:51: @jojulover exactly!

2022-05-29 at 09:55:34: i want to write something about how the book narcissus and goldmund cracked me open and spontaneously set my head on straight wrt my attitude towards my work

2022-05-29 at 09:51:21: @kehwho many such cases in the bay area too

2022-05-29 at 08:50:58: the way a frenchman lets you into his rich inner world of electronic music and shows you what listening closely can look like

he makes you want to dive deep into techno &amp; related genres; to attune your ear; to experience the squelchiest acid sounds you can find

2022-05-29 at 08:02:23: earlier this evening i was feeling restless and thought maybe i needed to be social

then i picked up my current crochet project and started working and somehow magically that restlessness disappeared. i was perfectly content to keep being by myself

2022-05-29 at 07:03:09: the way your roommate trades you electric octopus for khruangbin and the flute in “the zeroth” takes you somewhere that’s like india and like your childhood all at once

2022-05-29 at 06:57:02: that relationship was short-lived. 

the way your taste in music is like constructing a network, and you get a new node with “thursday” by pet shop boys from that one guy in the sketch comedy troupe

2022-05-29 at 06:53:27: the way your taste in music evolves and expands, like in high school when the first guy ever to like you back likes red hot chili peppers so you start listening to them too, and get super into them in a way that will last the rest of your life

2022-05-29 at 06:36:38: @sadlyoddisfying 👀 tru. also for cat owners. i know my cat would eventually catch any rat

2022-05-29 at 06:35:39: would you rather

2022-05-29 at 06:24:15: would you rather find

2022-05-28 at 23:50:16: grateful to experience days like this while i am in this part of my life, without dependents, and to have some time to get to know my bullshit a little better

2022-05-28 at 23:48:55: today has been a day of little responsibility and dealing with my own bullshit as i try to get myself to do things &amp; try to tend to myself

2022-05-28 at 23:24:57: yeah i know conflict can stir up negative emotions but every serious disagreement you resolve with someone is relational karma you needed to burn with them

2022-05-28 at 23:20:19: there is an album i’m listening to and it upsets me that i can’t listen to it all the way through. most songs are SO GOOD but some just need to be skipped. oh what could have been!

2022-05-28 at 23:17:25: i’m gonna make my brain happier

2022-05-28 at 22:58:42: having a lazy day today but perhaps my 1-good-thing for today will be making a nice dinner!

2022-05-28 at 21:36:42: i also want to get better at swimming. yes i can admire a lake i’ve hiked 12 miles in to see but imagine if i could swim in it too

2022-05-28 at 21:34:26: given that endurance and strength training are not great for me right now, this may be an opportune time to train mobility

2022-05-28 at 03:45:32: last hour of the drive home! never thought we’d get to this point

2022-05-27 at 20:24:41: @TheGrandBlooms eg like huh i guess you could actually get a handle on how taylor series and other series work / what they are by implementing them in a loop

2022-05-27 at 20:22:45: @TheGrandBlooms my immediate response was no! but i do feel i got lost somewhere along the way in my mathematics education and perhaps teaching math through coding would help

2022-05-27 at 00:07:03: tell me something you love and something you experience aversion towards

2022-05-25 at 04:18:59: @eIfcup do you have any crafty hobbies? knitting, crochet, others? gives time for reflection &amp; the process of making things has a momentum of its own that makes you wanna come back to it

2022-05-25 at 04:05:50: second viral fever in 3 weeks sure do be instilling an appreciation for good health

2022-05-24 at 16:28:40: hoooly migraine 😞

2022-05-20 at 22:19:00: one day i will dj a techno set with visuals made from microscopy videos of the cells i use in experiments

2022-05-20 at 05:29:58: i will keep fighting the good fight to make it all mean something

2022-05-20 at 05:27:53: day after my most recent acid trip, my friend was really taken aback by the difference in the energy behind my eyes. my lightheartedness was gone

2022-05-20 at 01:20:17: @joespurpleshirt @robjpalmer @embryosophy @MattiasInSpace oh man it might be time for a rewatch for me, i know i’ve seen it twice but i can barely remember it. what feelings does thinking about hang the dj conjure for you?

2022-05-20 at 00:59:40: @goblinodds 🤫

2022-05-20 at 00:05:42: @jojulover how!

2022-05-19 at 22:58:22: daytime is for crocheting in the sunshine and socializing, nighttime is for mixing 🙌🏽☀️🌙

2022-05-19 at 22:41:41: are you able to perceive in any way that the winter sunlight is weaker than the summer sunlight? (northern hemisphere residents)

2022-05-19 at 21:37:04: at this moment in my life my main drives are to chill, spend time with my love, acquaint myself with a new scientific sub-field, and get a few hobbies off the ground. life. is. good. ☀️☀️☀️

2022-05-19 at 19:59:45: all you have to do is find your way in

2022-05-19 at 05:39:40: @Probably_Brian watch an expert + ask em all of ur questions along the way

2022-05-18 at 19:46:22: cant wait to do a cross country road trip and embed the land of this nation into my soul

2022-05-18 at 19:45:15: i love this drive because it’s a part of me. i’ve grown up so much speeding down this landscape. first long drive i ever did by myself. this drive is part of our love

2022-05-18 at 19:42:50: i’m absolutely fucking baking in my car, it’s midday and 91 F. i’ve still got 4.5 hours to go. but dam do i feel alive

2022-05-18 at 19:26:23: @empathy2000 horizons that inspire a feeling

2022-05-18 at 19:14:00: well seeing as my aux isn’t working, the recs i really need are for radio stations in central california (along the 5) that play solid (non worship) tunes

2022-05-18 at 19:02:43: long drive smooth brain

2022-05-18 at 18:33:36: @qorprate hah not really. casting a wide net, hoping to hear whatever people like in particular + why they like it. oh ideally a full album over a single song

2022-05-18 at 18:26:28: pls rec me some 10+ years old techno/house/trance :)

2022-05-18 at 16:30:11: i’m coming to save you baby

2022-05-18 at 00:33:16: @empathy2000 bruh i had a moment just like this a few days ago. deleted the last 4 tweets in the thread and felt transiently a bit of cringe

2022-05-17 at 22:53:05: feelin cute lively sunshine-y determined fiery n giggly

2022-05-17 at 21:00:45: i'm back. things sure got weird. i was gifted an expensive amethyst necklace by a man who was/is moderately obsessed with me. so i dipped it into a creek to cleanse it. i danced a lot. i feel more mobile and limber and deep into my body than i was before

2022-05-17 at 20:54:58: @sicongshen do you think any part of this feeling relates to the spread-out-ness / hard-to-get-around-ness of LA?

2022-05-17 at 20:52:54: @peachblvd oh my goodness! see you very soon! maybe we could do a dinner at my place and/or a museum date?

2022-05-16 at 18:11:11: @nat_sharpe_ 👀!

2022-05-13 at 22:45:09: heading off to get weird in the forest! see ya on the other side 🌀🥰

2022-05-13 at 18:10:32: @alex_here_now what u been optimizing lately

2022-05-13 at 17:55:17: indoctrinated another person into the cacao way today, carrying on @harveykrishna_’s legacy

2022-05-13 at 07:29:18: part of the reason we’re so attached to thinking is because when we think we elicit reactions/sensations in our body and those can feel stimulating and nice

2022-05-13 at 06:57:57: @cIass_man but i need to get better at swimming! would use a normal pool but don’t like the chlorine

2022-05-13 at 06:57:32: @cIass_man knew someone would say this hahaha

2022-05-13 at 06:38:34: need a friend with access to a saltwater pool....

2022-05-13 at 05:57:09: now finally learning how to use the bag system to blow up a sleeping pad! no more being lightheaded blowing up a pad!

2022-05-13 at 02:11:40: @sadalsvvd ohoho meandering over to ig now

2022-05-12 at 22:34:04: obsessed with the length and drape of the dress, and the way the embroidered top part peeks out of my v neck sweater https://t.co/FqGWFIlsTg

2022-05-12 at 21:12:19: just pitched a tent by myself for the first time!

2022-05-12 at 20:11:55: @apophenial LOL which was your fav?

2022-05-12 at 19:18:45: the weight of cognitive load is a literal weight on your body (its force creates tension and contraction)

2022-05-12 at 19:12:29: for once i asked my search bar a question and the very first thing i clicked on is perfect. this is giving me so much inspiration rn lol https://t.co/F2ElE6oN13

2022-05-12 at 19:08:09: @apophenial oh shiet when were you last on this side of the atlantic ocean?

2022-05-12 at 18:50:50: i think two aspects of how much we’re able to give ourselves to a pursuit are (1) our intrinsic alignment with the pursuit, 

and (2) the interpersonal aspect of the pursuit (the social aspect is what encourages us to give ourselves)

2022-05-12 at 18:49:27: my favorite thing about weed might be that it skews everything just a little nonsensical

2022-05-12 at 18:09:21: @alth0u no althoooou pls don’t say it’s so

2022-05-12 at 08:13:50: now i can apply my brain to weekend festival preparations 😇

2022-05-12 at 07:43:24: done with finals! 🥳

2022-05-12 at 00:43:24: oh lol imma be doing some of this anyways to prepare for a party im throwing in a few weeks

2022-05-12 at 00:39:13: as ram dass might say, there’s really no such thing as giving or receiving anyways ;)

coalescing that with zen thought, there is only realizing and realizing time and again that we are not separate from the river of life

2022-05-12 at 00:24:42: emotions r information baybee

2022-05-12 at 00:21:19: i fuckin finished it. took me 12-4:15 and then i went to michael’s, but writing this want down helped me rearrange my energy and effort towards the goal

2022-05-12 at 00:20:27: i want to make a second instagram account that is more free form vibes, like a place for my new fiber/textile projects and also for the snippets of books i’m reading and for photos from my days; a place to capture the details and joys of day to day life

2022-05-12 at 00:16:31: i want to take a week long tolerance break at some point in the next few weeks

2022-05-12 at 00:15:03: i want to clean and fix up my room so it’s more functional and more aesthetic, and so that i feel less embarrassed whenever i take pictures of things that are in my room

2022-05-12 at 00:13:12: i want to turn this white and green fabric i found at a garage sale into a long dress with a slit on the left side https://t.co/LLiMejKdIw

2022-05-11 at 23:28:07: tbh it’s good to identify this rn but any conclusions i come to don’t really matter until i’m done with finals week and back from my month off and then into the thick of things

2022-05-11 at 23:26:43: i have this recurring sense of “how much of myself can i give to my work?” where giving myself to my work is what i want to do, i associate that with excellence and growth

but i feel constrained and like i can’t give as much as i’d like to, to my work

2022-05-10 at 18:47:20: u know the pan is hot enough when da mustard seeds start popping

2022-05-10 at 18:23:30: @jonathandubin also, i’m generally curious about the way that you relate to books/reading. so please go off if you’d like

2022-05-10 at 18:17:30: @jonathandubin 🤍

i often find a book hits me harder when its lessons are applicable to challenges i’m weathering in my life at the time of reading. you have any good book-life synergy going on?

2022-05-10 at 18:00:59: always grateful for the structure of life. today its duration feels perfect: a whole life in which to get to know ourselves

2022-05-10 at 17:50:50: i want to spend 12 to 3pm today finishing a project that is due today, and after that i want to go to joann’s and trader joe’s

2022-05-09 at 18:13:42: @PhrygianKing for sure! this is one - you can also find recipes that use the stove instead of an instant pot. for this recipe, i'd recommend upping the salt to taste and heeding the recipe's suggestion to add lemon juice at the end :)

https://t.co/CLBuMgAvF3

2022-05-09 at 09:43:11: good night twitter, it’s been a good day 😌

2022-05-09 at 04:12:09: done! kitchen is clean and we shared a yummy warm comfort dinner i made. she said the meal felt like a warm hug :)

2022-05-09 at 04:11:25: done! https://t.co/ucCoqp4wa1

2022-05-09 at 03:36:45: @cIass_man good fuckin tweet!

2022-05-09 at 02:55:10: i feel like i’ve magically tapped into a vein of joy inside of me. i didn’t know i could feel so happy with so much work to do

2022-05-09 at 02:52:08: looks like i may be spending the night alternating between a systems biology project and a crochet project... 🧶🧬😇

2022-05-09 at 01:55:08: new obsession... cozy bass heartbeat, delicious feeling treble

https://t.co/KoxBTOIvGI

2022-05-09 at 01:53:14: went for a tiny little run and body gave me so many good feelings! 💛

2022-05-09 at 01:33:25: i think my post covid body is finally strong enough to start going for runs again! 🥰🏃🏽‍♀️🏘🍃🌸

2022-05-09 at 00:59:20: it is thrilling to be honest with yourself! 

to both praise and provide constructive feedback in good measure!

2022-05-09 at 00:43:15: i feel it already, there is something ridiculously powerful about articulating these things https://t.co/NXZLbxFdEk

2022-05-09 at 00:35:27: @jonathandubin honestly i would recommend this book first, if you want to experience zen in a potentially life changing way https://t.co/wfv7Ti80FU

2022-05-09 at 00:33:27: i could be better about managing some attention/distraction loops; 

but i’m doing a good job considering my stressors and desires with greater equanimity; 
i’m doing good things; 
i’m noticing and attending to body sensations; 
i’m noticing and playing with my speed of existence

2022-05-09 at 00:30:32: i’m pleased with the way i’m taking care of my mental health today :)

2022-05-09 at 00:18:14: wow the soles of my feet are unusually achy. i knew i was feeling disconnected from / cramped in my body, but this is an interesting sensation

2022-05-09 at 00:14:44: question to guide your next action: am i experiencing an energy deficit or a clarity deficit?

2022-05-08 at 23:55:44: who knew when we took the train to the beach together three years ago we were etching that date into history

2022-05-08 at 23:22:35: i want to make kitchari tonight, for simple, homemade nutrition that is tasty and easy on my (stressed, mildly dysregulated) digestive system

2022-05-08 at 23:12:18: @Zoomification lmao i can’t say i’m much of a marvel fan... in your opinion, what was a recent good marvel movie that came out?

2022-05-08 at 23:11:01: dissolve the obstacles in the way of completely giving yourself to life’s currents

2022-05-08 at 23:03:20: what’s everybody’s upcoming week looking like?

2022-05-08 at 22:44:43: i want to expand my emotional capacity, which will require more attention to habits which create joy and more willingness to feel “negative” emotions; 

this may also involve asking for more feedback &amp; overcoming fear of criticism

2022-05-08 at 22:38:20: i took it slow this morning, read the beginning of a new zen book; and as my parasympathetic nervous system came back to life i felt clarity arrive and the feeling of honesty reappear at my core and emanate outwards

2022-05-08 at 22:34:35: i want to crochet and mail off an appropriate gift for friends who are expecting a child in a few months

2022-05-08 at 22:33:09: i want to do a kind thing or two for my roommate (eg properly clean the kitchen, get her a treat from the korean bakery), to support her during finals week and to show my gratitude for the kind things she’s done for me recently

2022-05-08 at 22:22:04: ongoing thread to articulate the things i want, towards learning a thing or two about who i am •

2022-05-08 at 22:15:38: @nikitanomo what’s a piece of art you saw recently (or not recently) that made you feel something? what did it make you feel?

2022-05-08 at 22:13:12: @nikitanomo what’s something you made recently (or not recently) that made you feel something?

2022-05-08 at 18:01:40: might be the sort of sunday to pull a toru watanabe and write a letter to someone i love and long for

2022-05-08 at 05:16:19: endosymbiose me baby

2022-05-07 at 09:33:25: i’m gonna start crocheting a one shoulder top (or maybe a different crochet top) tonight or in the morning !

2022-05-07 at 07:58:15: a little over a month ago i made a new friend at school and discovered he didn’t live too far away. so i asked, do you guys have parties? can i come to your parties? 🥺 

and now i’m at my first such party with this friend and it is SO fun! 

very similar playful wavelengths 🥰

2022-05-07 at 06:32:47: “i’d do 2cb and a 5k but not lsd and a half-marathon”

2022-05-06 at 23:49:07: i changed my setting today (worked on campus versus staying at home) and how marvelous it is to feel similar things transposed upon a different environment. brings novelty and charm to my working day

2022-05-06 at 23:45:30: @willlowthewhisp bf and i are over 2 years into long distance, i’m feeling on and off impatient because i wish we could just jump into the next phase of our lives together. how to handle the distance / reframe my impatience?

2022-05-06 at 17:50:45: been reading coelho’s book about sex. some nice ideas but i’m feeling generally ambivalent

2022-05-06 at 05:47:53: don’t mind me just humbly accepting i’ll miss the next bus and getting stoned under the night sky!!!

2022-05-05 at 23:23:48: honestly though my mental concept of god != gentleness. god is more like nature. and nature isn’t gentle. nature is impartial

2022-05-05 at 23:21:18: dear god, may i remember and embody your gentleness

2022-05-05 at 22:47:55: how to jolt or cajole oneself back into the body?

2022-05-05 at 22:38:27: one day bf and i will live out our east coast arc

2022-05-05 at 22:13:47: you can come up with ever more complex words to describe what is going on inside, or you can simplify what you feel

2022-05-05 at 22:12:51: feeling a need to re establish the feeling of honesty within myself

2022-05-05 at 22:03:37: gentle reminder to get offa here and take care of your shite

2022-05-05 at 21:50:12: mixed bag of stress about things i think are worthwhile and stress about things i think are silly but i have to do. wish the latter category did not exist!

2022-05-05 at 21:48:42: @WeftOfSoul festival venue i’m going to soon has a graveyard of decrepit big machinery 😅🚜

2022-05-05 at 21:46:50: @tasshinfogleman @hormeze wow too good

2022-05-05 at 21:45:14: the next 7 days are gonna be a bit of a slog aren’t they..... have a lot of balls up in the air with the end of the semester &amp; other deadlines. but hopefully i can make this sprint more pleasant with a few fun social things and journaling/meditation

2022-05-05 at 21:41:22: @nickcammarata all of these sound nice maybe i should stop sleepin on jhanas

2022-05-05 at 01:41:21: we pulsate when we weather experiences. i want to feel your pulse

2022-05-05 at 01:37:13: i want to love you here, on whirlwind nights and the morning after; every morning, the fabric of everyday stitched with your presence here with me

2022-05-05 at 01:27:07: i want to love you against this landscape

2022-05-05 at 01:25:51: there will never be enough words to convey how special you are to me, but in some transient moments they come pretty damn close

2022-05-05 at 01:17:53: i have discovered the perfect neighborhood walk to be taken 1.5-2 hours before sunset. perfect length, plentiful sun exposure. no longer will i leave my house and ask, “where will i walk today?” i will just Know where to go. no thinking, only photosynthesizing

2022-05-05 at 01:01:35: God (your will) knows your inner feelings

2022-05-05 at 00:34:55: @relic_radiation man this whole thread makes my heart happy. keep doing your thing elena, you’re killing it 💗

2022-05-04 at 20:50:41: could groove to this all day long

2022-05-03 at 16:24:08: @MCMCD_ aw so exciting! i don’t know much about wedding veil selection, is it mostly the length and the ... embroidery?

2022-05-03 at 03:29:41: god i adore fleet foxes

2022-05-03 at 03:26:49: what can i say i don’t want to be sucked into the bagel 🥺🥺🥺

2022-05-03 at 03:21:06: how to create meaning when things feel meaningless? when things feel meaningless i crave meaning

2022-05-03 at 03:03:22: to me this is the sound of love

2022-04-30 at 03:14:57: putting more decorations up in my room so as to make it more cozy, after @kbala444 absolutely roasted my room by rating it 6/10

2022-04-30 at 03:08:43: @myceliummage the fun grew alongside a blossoming sense of humility - a sense of, there is so much i can still learn from being here

2022-04-30 at 02:49:53: @myceliummage aww! 💛

2022-04-30 at 02:47:17: @myceliummage IKR !

2022-04-30 at 02:46:20: here are two flowers we found on campus then looked at under the microscope my friend has access to https://t.co/KNDuQczz39

2022-04-30 at 02:45:18: i wish my branch of biology would enable me to spend the occasional workday fully outdoors. alas! 

maybe i can pick a model organism that would enable this; or maybe i can tag along for the occasional foray with other labs 🍃🔬🧪

2022-04-30 at 02:43:26: for some reason, for a while twitter hasn’t been feeling as fun to me as it used to. today was different! i’ve had so much fun today and the day’s not even over yet. thank you for the role you play in my experience here!

2022-04-30 at 02:38:42: good day for dance breakthroughs. figured out how to do some two handed flowy moves and used dance to begin to dislodge an aching, rotting jealousy in my chest and throat. inspired by @hormeze’s https://t.co/VFNIlRycLZ

2022-04-30 at 02:15:59: https://t.co/hf6h2xhB99

2022-04-30 at 02:05:53: oh what joy it brings me to be something for you

2022-04-30 at 02:04:40: @embryosophy @tallsnail @profeshkitten 🥺🥰♥️

2022-04-30 at 01:59:07: oh - when you feel you are at once both the source from which the fountain flows and the water bounding forth

2022-04-30 at 01:57:06: @simonsarris woah yeah

2022-04-30 at 01:51:21: magical fit for cleaning my room on a sunny friday evening in quarantine. makes me feel long legged, forest nymph adjacent. thank u to the closet of @profeshkitten for the lovely white and blue top pieces 🥰 https://t.co/Vl5mcp2Fjr

2022-04-30 at 01:45:30: ongoing thread of fits i adore, for how they look and how they make me feel 💖✨

2022-04-30 at 01:33:49: bro i swear all the mucus coming out of me this morning - insanely runny nose, similar cough - facilitated a parallel psychological cleansing/release

2022-04-30 at 01:11:33: @rmpars thank you! i know i will, just have to be patient and open :)

2022-04-30 at 01:10:45: who do you water with your love?

2022-04-30 at 01:08:49: ISO of a nice forest clearing within 30 min drive of berkeley, that can be accessed at nighttime for some communing with the moon

2022-04-30 at 01:04:44: i’m making coasters for the friends who have helped me out during the worst of my symptoms - 3 pairs to make, so gratifying to work on https://t.co/VPVJc34tEk

2022-04-30 at 01:01:39: my new labmates are slacking me wonderful and kind “welcome to the lab!” messages 🥺🥺🥺 i get to look forward to seeing them for a happy hour type event next friday afternoon ♥️ it will be nice to be out of quarantine

2022-04-30 at 00:22:11: @_holyweather awh ♥️ so glad to hear

2022-04-30 at 00:14:21: @danielifidare i’m happy you somehow found your way to me on here, and i’m excited to get to know you better :)

2022-04-30 at 00:13:51: @danielifidare aw hey daniel, i find your relationship to the natural world so inspiring; i love your photos and the way you share snippets of the creatures and scenes that enrapture you. you have a groundedness and peace to you. i’m grateful to be able to witness your spiritual path;

2022-04-30 at 00:06:47: @_holyweather hi holy! your aesthetic sensibilities are just sublime. you ask such interesting questions - which must reflect a deep curiosity and wonder towards the world. you’re clever! i never know what to expect with your tweets, but i wouldn’t have it any other way ☀️

2022-04-30 at 00:03:16: @moothought moo, you show up on here in a way that feels authentic and original; both silly and serious in the best way. i love your retweets, you always surface great stuff

2022-04-29 at 23:37:50: @embryosophy ♥️♥️♥️

2022-04-29 at 23:29:55: @embryosophy buddhi, you are so vibrant! i appreciate your playfulness, wisdom, and patience. i was listening to your episode on tasshin’s podcast and i loved the thoughtful, meandering, intentional way you speak. i’m grateful you have found work that is so deeply aligned with who you are 💛

2022-04-29 at 23:26:34: @valor_zhang thank you for saying this, it means a lot! ♥️

2022-04-29 at 23:26:17: @valor_zhang aw val i admire your steadfast commitment to being yourself; you are a lively and positive presence on here; “done is better than perfect” now lives rent free in my head and i’ve caught myself saying it to myself multiple times since your post

2022-04-29 at 22:59:02: reply to this and i will reply with an encouraging tweet (not a subtweet) 💗 https://t.co/fQDVSvBixW

2022-04-29 at 21:41:28: don’t you love the process of coming to love the process? :)

2022-04-29 at 21:39:28: currently loving the therapy in a nutshell youtube channel

2022-04-29 at 20:59:10: @qorprate aw snav you’ve brought a big smile onto my face

2022-04-29 at 20:55:47: @qorprate alrighty 😇

2022-04-29 at 20:29:54: would you look at these delightfully strange flowers i saw yesterday? all of them have markings on exactly two of five petals. makes them feel a little like animals https://t.co/yaWz5yl5zo

2022-04-29 at 20:27:20: @nobuhojimichaan ooooh love that insight! 🤲🏽🙏🏽

2022-04-29 at 20:25:57: don’t mind me just getting ready to have a blissful afternoon crocheting and tweeting in the sunlight at the park

2022-04-29 at 20:24:04: @nobuhojimichaan oooh is there a difference between how different nut milks replenish you? eg how do almond / oat / soy etc etc compare?

2022-04-29 at 20:19:33: @nobuhojimichaan hahaha you have a point wrt the cosmic timeline

ice cream is a fairly rare treat for me! i don’t often have a sweet tooth, and if i do i usually satisfy it with a few chocolate chips; my teeth are also a little sensitive to temperature extremes

2022-04-29 at 20:11:36: @nobuhojimichaan incredible. coconut flakes are the best

2022-04-29 at 20:09:47: @nobuhojimichaan aww haha very nice. best flavor?

2022-04-29 at 20:04:03: @nobuhojimichaan hah how does vegan ice cream come into play?

2022-04-29 at 02:03:08: @altashtree this puts words to some part of the vibe shift i've observed

2022-04-29 at 01:50:26: @Probably_Brian hehehe ☺️

2022-04-29 at 01:49:34: also: finding music you like makes you feel more like yourself because it’s literally you https://t.co/g3T5HhLOyj

2022-04-29 at 01:47:44: and so it is particularly rewarding to have sacrificed potential discomfort for the reward of finding something you end up liking

2022-04-29 at 01:47:43: so when we venture into the territory of new music, not knowing if we’ll like it, we allow a little uncertainty. we let down our defenses. we become softer, more receptive to what is outside ourselves

2022-04-29 at 01:47:43: when we’re able to open ourselves to uncertainty, it signals that we are more open towards the world

2022-04-29 at 01:47:43: by default we are generally comforted by familiarity - the comforting embrace of music you know and love &amp; you know will generate a known feeling

2022-04-29 at 01:47:43: bf pointed out that finding new music he likes makes him feel more like himself. this is true for me too

here’s my silly little theory for why that is:

2022-04-29 at 01:33:59: my friend brought me a loose leaf tea called “midnight sun”. took the first sip and can confirm, tastes like a midnight sun

2022-04-29 at 01:29:28: my advisor (!) said that often people don’t have the patience to mold their thesis projects to be aligned with their deepest interests - 

because the process of uncovering your deepest interests requires time, external support, sustained effort &amp; weathering uncertainty

2022-04-29 at 01:26:47: very excited for the next few months of phd life. two weeks more to round off the semester, then a month off, then we enter ~ideation and exploration territory~ towards developing my thesis project

2022-04-29 at 01:25:14: a meal, a table you set, a painting, knitting, sketch... looking for the most mundane and the most out there interpretations

2022-04-29 at 01:22:48: reply with a pic of the last thing you made with your hands!

2022-04-29 at 00:54:31: for sure a little bummed that i can’t go to two social things i was really excited for this weekend. i’m not sure how i will go from being bummed to being content, but i’m sure it will happen

2022-04-28 at 22:44:53: just got off zoom call where i committed to my thesis lab! very happy to have staked out an intellectual home. sensations of sickness feel less pressing, giddiness prevails

2022-04-28 at 21:09:58: today is day three or so and after a morning of coughing and watching many episodes of selling sunset, i’ve put myself in a quirky outfit and i’m out for a walk. the weather is lovely today

2022-04-28 at 21:08:12: matilda’s covid diaries: a thread

2022-04-27 at 21:55:21: ten muffins it is 😬

2022-04-27 at 21:54:45: @quotidiania hehe i meant the 2016 album

2022-04-27 at 21:24:21: @quotidiania yes!!!!!!!! i think it’s far better than the previous album

2022-04-27 at 18:16:34: RT @mollyfmielke: funny how many garden variety life pursuits (fulfillment, identity, relationships, etc) kinda figure themselves out when…

2022-04-27 at 17:21:52: bf and i have a wonderfully asymmetric bet going where if i test positive for It he will buy me ten muffins and if my symptoms are something else i buy him one muffin

2022-04-25 at 21:38:26: and back to california we go

2022-04-24 at 23:39:06: @myceliummage hai hope u had a great time away

2022-04-24 at 06:55:29: new knowledge and new experience conspire to take us ever deeper

2022-04-24 at 06:53:09: twitter feels the best to me when i am able to express who i am, which exists below any uncertainty at the surface

2022-04-24 at 06:49:28: say it from your lips til it reaches your heart

2022-04-24 at 06:48:44: i love you even more for the ways you are different from me, despite the transient frictions our differences cause. our differences create light

2022-04-24 at 06:45:40: tonight we’re alive and coherent and in love. treasuring moments of uncertainty and admiring the way everything glows when we look with love

2022-04-24 at 00:55:02: teach to your head reach to your heart

2022-04-22 at 15:42:10: @rhymeswithvocal had a dream last night about watching the movie 😅

2022-04-22 at 15:41:41: @rhymeswithvocal planning to see it today with bf!

2022-04-21 at 22:41:47: one day i will live in a house with a large kitchen island and a craft room of my own, where the yarn and fabrics from projects will accumulate and be neatly organized by color and material

2022-04-21 at 22:34:52: tomorrow i’ve gotta be living, breathing peace for those i love. feeling ungrounded and a little all over the place today

2022-04-21 at 21:52:03: @wholebodyprayer aye aye!

2022-04-21 at 18:38:13: @relic_radiation i learned much faster &amp; more fully than i could have learned by myself

i imagine this is similar to what you’re experiencing in your ritual group!

4/fin

2022-04-21 at 18:36:33: @relic_radiation like, the amount of growth i experienced - new familiarity with complex concepts, understanding questions in the field, *how to approach being a scientist* - as an individual, as a collaborator, as a mentee/mentor

is entirely owed to that dynamic learning amongst community

3/n

2022-04-21 at 18:34:36: @relic_radiation but in jan-feb of this year, i worked in a lab environment that truly felt like a community, people bound together by curiosity, passion, kindness, fascination

and there i realized i learn *so* much faster among people

2/n

2022-04-21 at 18:31:55: @relic_radiation you know, this reminds me of something i’ve recognized during this first year of grad school:

i used to conceptualize learning as a more solitary thing, and even in response to your initial tweet i find myself thinking, “what book to read; when to go to the forest alone?”

1/n

2022-04-21 at 17:49:51: @relic_radiation thank you for sharing! and for validating that it’s possible :)

2022-04-21 at 17:43:27: @jezzejayz :) 💗

2022-04-21 at 17:39:52: @relic_radiation how did this mode of being arise in you?

2022-04-21 at 15:35:35: @moothought yes moo, for sure. here i wanted to share that crochet feels particularly special to me right now

2022-04-21 at 05:23:56: learning on the job 😎

2022-04-21 at 05:18:15: @tallsnail i love it! ur eye is so striking and i love the nose piercing on you

2022-04-21 at 04:06:38: experiencing a tremendous amount of flow with crochet, who knew it could dissolve time?!

2022-04-21 at 03:59:26: here’s to hoping i’m in the bay area next 4/20 :’)

2022-04-21 at 03:21:56: first time doing ribbing. a few stitches into next line and realized i was a stitch off (curvy lines)! so i fixed it (straight lines)! blue arrow points to beginning of line https://t.co/jOBYkNyX4e

2022-04-21 at 01:30:16: recent fit, recent lighting in my berkeley bedroom https://t.co/QxykY0EZjX

2022-04-20 at 19:48:47: @rmpars your tweets have an energy that is sweet, earnest, and alive - glad you’re on here too and here’s to hoping our paths cross IRL one day 🤍

2022-04-20 at 19:46:26: @rmpars ahhh! 🥺🥺🥺💗

2022-04-20 at 18:43:33: @rmpars thank you for this, it’s very sweet 🤍

2022-04-20 at 18:43:21: @rmpars bahaha i’m sure we’d WORK IT OUT

(inspired by @kehwho &amp; @nat_sharpe_ 🤍)

2022-04-20 at 18:33:20: @nat_sharpe_ @kehwho i’ll take this as a sign to carry on the torch :-)

2022-04-20 at 17:53:29: my dad is such a sweet man. love him so much. so proud of him

2022-04-20 at 04:14:38: @rmpars will take if ur still doin em :)

2022-04-19 at 23:36:10: @maxim_eorr 🤍

2022-04-19 at 20:33:12: today and/or tomorrow i’ll be reading the gita cover to cover 🙏🏽🤲🏽🏹

2022-04-19 at 20:06:42: @JuliaRosedale @rhymeswithvocal ^^^ my first thought was “maybe you should find a good book to read” (if you aren’t reading one rn)

2022-04-19 at 19:57:21: @goblinodds oh dude lemon balm tea too https://t.co/ugmB7lAbrI

2022-04-19 at 19:46:30: gonna go private for a little bit. feeling tender and feeling some subtle shifts within

2022-04-19 at 19:32:15: @kehwho little synchronicity - my mom recently started performing a ritual where she bathes the goddess in water with a mix of a few different flower essences. she really loves the way the practice resonates with her

2022-04-18 at 21:21:42: @captain_mrs something about the floral color combination there - the pale blue, white, red - feels sweet, i want to say almost quaint

2022-04-16 at 21:41:24: the first time i ever did the drive down from sf to los angeles it took me from 7pm to 2am. the single lane highway near gilroy, with its curving, twisty-turving in the dark terrified me. i couldn’t bring myself to go faster than 72mph on the 5 south

2022-04-16 at 21:38:58: the way back has all sorts of landmarks. the endless field of cows at one point on the east side of the 5. the burger king at the first exit after the 152-w turn-off. i let myself stop there as a treat. the beautiful bright blue reservoir near gilroy

2022-04-16 at 21:37:07: it’d feel easy for the first hour, until i’d realize i was an hour in and not even to santa cruz. from then it became a marathon. i usually tried my best to do it in a single shot, but i always had to stop for gas at one point. so, a straight shot with a ten minute break

2022-04-16 at 21:35:38: i don’t mind it that way. i do miss the way i’d get possessed into driving down, how the desire and passion and escapist urge would build up inside of me. i’d finally sit down in the drivers seat and start driving, driving, driving

2022-04-16 at 21:34:19: these days the undertaking of a six hour drive and back feels like too much. we’ve got our own lives, own work, own things going. so we try to opt for flights

2022-04-16 at 21:32:56: remember when we’d get in our cars and drive six hours straight to see each other? and we’d do it nearly every month

2022-04-16 at 21:26:09: you can make others so happy just by thinking of them :)

2022-04-16 at 20:49:56: @sirsfurther @moothought 🅱️ig if true

2022-04-16 at 20:48:46: i really admire the prof and it’s insane i get to train with him for the next few years

2022-04-16 at 20:47:57: getting real emotional thinking about officially joining my lab. deeply grateful to have found the prof and the lab mates, to have trusted my intuition to lead me there and my faith to keep me there

2022-04-16 at 20:41:22: all i want is a pair of platform sandals or platform boots. just that, and i’d be invincible

2022-04-16 at 20:40:01: @tasshinfogleman appreciate it, tasshin! ♥️

2022-04-16 at 20:35:07: tomorrow afternoon i will be across the country having chai with my parents and little brother 😌

2022-04-16 at 20:20:47: okay, now can you mentally envision putting that outfit on a friend of yours?

2022-04-16 at 20:18:54: can you construct an outfit from your closet entirely in your mind?

2022-04-16 at 20:11:53: love when the moon shines through a pillowy night sky https://t.co/w8vD5cUFr6

2022-04-16 at 20:09:40: unsure why my tweets seem to be getting less engagement recently. i’ve got some guesses, but maybe it’s more the algorithm than it is me

2022-04-16 at 20:06:59: i love cutting out unnecessary words from my writing..... it’s the zinsser in me 🤍

2022-04-16 at 20:01:48: i have two dark navy blue cashmere sweaters (one a slight v-neck, the other a cardigan), both of which were found in piles of clothing people were giving away on the street

2022-04-16 at 19:58:16: i’m gonna finish my first hat soon. i’ll show you guys when i do :)

2022-04-16 at 19:57:50: my mom recently realized that things are different now (i’m somehow different now) and she has begun to indoctrinate me in the way of the hook (crochet)

2022-04-16 at 19:57:10: as a child i was never detail oriented enough to make progress on skills like crochet or sewing

2022-04-16 at 19:53:57: i’m chillin HARD today

2022-04-16 at 19:48:55: @peachblvd i know this exact pain

2022-04-16 at 05:48:13: growing together with my parents. becoming softer, more loving. more peaceful, more at peace with the way that life goes. more devoted to what calls our flame

2022-04-16 at 05:43:24: growing together with my partner for three years now and many more to come. the growth and transformation and mutual support and encouragement - opening up futures beyond what we could have anticipated. he’s seen me open and blossom and i’ll see him to his next blossoming https://t.co/6zLVTg9oN6

2022-04-16 at 05:41:20: growing together with my friends who live nearby and who are navigating grad school / adjacent and their twenties and the bay area

2022-04-16 at 05:40:40: oh what a gift it is to be growing together

2022-04-16 at 05:39:27: blisteringly clear moon tonight 🌕

2022-04-16 at 01:51:48: done!!! omw home!!! i made some beauuuutiful videos of cells doing their thing in 3d

2022-04-15 at 22:45:19: all that stands between me going home and putting on a cute outfit for dinner with friends is a problem set and a data set that needs to be rendered in 3d

2022-04-15 at 02:52:47: halfway thru time course assay, having myself a little dance party in the tissue culture room between timepoints 💃

2022-04-15 at 01:15:13: it’s coming right up... excited to cross the threshold into the next stage of my phd 🥰 https://t.co/GzVLdKTFIK

2022-04-15 at 00:59:23: having a nice break room at work does, in fact, encourage me to take nice breaks

2022-04-15 at 00:52:36: god was tellin me to check my ‘tude lol

2022-04-15 at 00:46:32: earlier today i was in a bad mood and at a moment when my irritation flared i accidentally dropped a test tube. it shattered and its contents were lost, which meant i needed to redo a step and was set back 30min-1h

2022-04-15 at 00:44:35: long days recently but i don’t mind so much at the end of the day. at the beginning of the day things seem insurmountable. but now all i’ve gotta do is sync my brain and my hands and follow the procedure

2022-04-15 at 00:42:29: @rhymeswithvocal fav drnk?

2022-04-15 at 00:37:19: if i play my cards right i may be able to be done with my lab work in 2 hours 🙃

2022-04-13 at 15:23:22: i’m teetering on the wrong side of overwhelm and i can’t tell yet if i’m overcommitted or if the work will feel feasible as i tackle more of it

2022-04-12 at 20:42:16: @nat_sharpe_ your mischievous expression at the end is very sweet and makes me smile

2022-04-12 at 00:59:23: @_StevenFan was feeling something like that here https://t.co/k2Dw4VhJgs

2022-04-12 at 00:58:52: @_StevenFan yeah dude

2022-04-12 at 00:54:31: @nickcammarata o fuk. tru

2022-04-12 at 00:53:18: @nickcammarata if the happiness is in you always, what happens when you experience the things you crave? lil transient spike?

2022-04-12 at 00:53:08: @nickcammarata premise makes sense to me, i’m in the beginning phases of emotionally internalizing it;

2022-04-11 at 23:53:02: reframing my borderline overwhelm as gratitude for having challenges that drive me to turn to god and the ancient, accumulated knowledge of faith

2022-04-11 at 23:34:55: if you’re looking for something to add to your self-regulation stack, i recently learned that lemon balm calms your nervous system. makes a tasty tea too

2022-04-11 at 23:29:30: emailed the ladies who run the women’s bible study group on campus, fingers crossed they respond and i can join tomorrow night

2022-04-11 at 05:20:45: alright i’m doing it i’m following bf’s brother on strava

2022-04-11 at 04:50:25: progress and final dinner plate :) https://t.co/2ec6WZ6AwN

2022-04-11 at 04:09:28: @eIfcup high protein?

2022-04-11 at 04:03:19: lol stiffness of the overall vegetable definitely has an effect of how hard it is to cut

2022-04-11 at 04:02:56: guys... do you reckon the cellular level properties of the cells that make up a fruit/vegetable’s skin determine how hard it is to cut through, eg how slide-y the surface is? (assuming a knife of equal sharpness)

like, eggplants are harder to cut than, uh, cucumbers

2022-04-11 at 03:51:10: have a major hankering for fried eggplant tonight, let’s get to work

2022-04-11 at 02:07:05: may this be a reminder to approach others with softness

2022-04-11 at 01:52:50: 😌☺️☀️ https://t.co/iXDDIhnA41

2022-04-11 at 01:06:10: today was an emotional rollercoaster but i made it through and feel far better now than earlier

2022-04-10 at 22:33:54: best way to learn biology is to date a biologist 😇

2022-04-09 at 21:24:35: oh what a blessing it is to be young

2022-04-09 at 21:03:49: @Prigoose post as many as you want! i wanna see! ♥️

2022-04-09 at 20:48:01: now i am soliciting answers from @relic_radiation @altashtree @jonathandubin @Prigoose @gracemercur ☺️

2022-04-09 at 20:44:16: i’ll be home with family in just over a week, to help out during a time that will be emotionally difficult for all involved. reinvesting in prayer and meditation seem like obvious things to do

any other suggestions for things to do to remain strong &amp; hold difficult emotions?

2022-04-09 at 20:20:20: @dendricide very nice. same color as in pic? roll up at the very bottoms? do they feel durable?

2022-04-09 at 20:15:45: @nickcammarata 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺

2022-04-09 at 20:15:29: i wanna get to know you a little better. reply with your current favorite piece of clothing?

2022-04-09 at 20:06:23: @jonathandubin hehe 💪🏽

2022-04-09 at 20:02:28: @nickcammarata oh this one’s so beautiful

2022-04-09 at 19:56:35: love conceptualizing cleaning my room as taking a deep dive into my psyche

2022-04-09 at 19:01:50: @eIfcup boyf swears that coffee feels best on days when you get a great night of sleep. makes the coffee more mood-boosting and less likely to promote anxiety

2022-04-09 at 06:30:42: love little free libraries because they have the chance of inducing lightning bolts of serendipity

2022-04-09 at 06:26:32: i think i just found a book i’m gonna be obsessively reading. flipped to a random page and breath caught in my throat from the text

2022-04-09 at 06:24:01: i love evaluating neighborhoods and cities by the quality of books in their little free libraries

2022-04-09 at 05:49:32: theobromine weed gf caffeine nicotine bf

2022-04-09 at 05:28:04: oh the process of letting your guards down around one another. let it be a process :)

2022-04-09 at 05:22:20: wouldn’t be surprised if i end up like this in a year or so https://t.co/vZ3y07mAWu

2022-04-09 at 05:21:29: a year ago today i decided on my school

2022-04-09 at 05:20:58: RT @lilaexpt: glad to have words to honor and promises to keep

2022-04-09 at 05:13:06: @jemgold_ hehe does she study fungal immune systems and forage?

2022-04-09 at 05:02:28: index of threads where i talk about how i relate to science 👩🏽‍🔬 •

2022-04-09 at 05:00:02: @LauraDeming (which is natural! we’re all managing varying levels of uncertainty)

2022-04-09 at 04:59:25: @LauraDeming it seems to me that you may have mixed feelings about this joy because you have uncertainty about what your future in science will involve

2022-04-09 at 04:57:37: @LauraDeming i think for me it doesn’t feel hedonistic because it feels *earned*. also, other hedonistic pursuits create only transient joy. when i apply myself to understanding scientific discoveries (eg t cell motility paper earlier this week), i feel a deep contentment for days

2022-04-09 at 04:54:42: @LauraDeming oh laura. wow. i know the feeling you’re describing. i’ve only started experiencing it recently, and for me i’ve been able to access it as i’ve become more confident / less self-doubtful in the first year of my phd

2022-04-09 at 04:07:11: consciously *releasing* the expectations we place on ourselves is far better than engaging in hedonism to avoid the weight of expectation

2022-04-09 at 04:05:54: if you wish, AMA and i’ll consider QTing with a voice tweet

2022-04-09 at 04:04:39: in the mood to compose soothing and earnest voice memos to friends

2022-04-09 at 04:01:43: thinking tonight about how pirsig told a student struggling to write - just begin to write about the smallest brick of the house, and carry on from there. how when we release ourselves we come gushing forth

2022-04-09 at 03:34:28: so much cognitive bullshit to wade through. why is it so hard to return to our purest expression of ourself?

2022-04-08 at 23:01:26: @BroductManager banger

2022-04-08 at 19:08:50: wonder what the delay between pressing a key and hearing a sound is in a bell tower

2022-04-08 at 18:08:56: @powerbottomdad1 some recent papers from the biophysical journal: https://t.co/VO08xueQs6

2022-04-08 at 18:05:39: @powerbottomdad1 there’s a rift within the field where people fall into one of three categories: cell biologists, structural biologists, and protein engineers. all three of those are facets of modern biophysics

2022-04-08 at 18:04:07: @powerbottomdad1 in many ways it’s exactly what it sounds like - applying physics to understand biology

2022-04-08 at 16:52:04: @visakanv well this is just brilliant

2022-04-08 at 15:35:56: ok this has gotten more than enough attention

2022-04-08 at 15:33:51: @elle_nour13 far from my first 🙃 thank you!

2022-04-08 at 09:29:43: @nibrasibn ur eyelashes look lovely!

2022-04-08 at 05:05:30: @maxkriegers @ArtirKel cozy!

2022-04-08 at 05:05:17: kinda wanna have a psychedelic experience this weekend you guys have any words of inspiration to guide the experience?

2022-04-07 at 20:47:33: @tarnrj @matthaig1 don’t forget, you will one day experience pain that matches this joy. that too will be transient

2022-04-07 at 20:42:31: curious if any of you found a version of the bible which resonated with you much more than other version, by virtue of the choice of words

2022-04-07 at 20:39:16: i think the way that people weave the bible into their lives is far more beautiful than the bible itself

2022-04-07 at 20:32:24: i think what both these women scientist do is have a strong personal style driven by what they value in their lifestyle &amp; clothing. it brings them peace, joy, and excitement to dress themselves

2022-04-07 at 20:29:30: my intended science phd student style is somewhere on the continuum between them. for my first few months, i was dressing pretty idiosyncratically; then i started dressing more plainly, which felt good

2022-04-07 at 20:28:20: one is extremely practical, but well-fitted, nice colors, nice materials, pretty knits

the other is very much a stoner, often wears clothing i’d consider impractical (not warm enough, too flowy, too much fabric), but great patterns, textures

2022-04-07 at 20:25:32: i have two friends who are women scientists and who have incredible senses of style, but along different axes

2022-04-07 at 20:19:09: hmu if anyone wants to go college-student-move-out-dumpster-diving in a month and a half or so

2022-04-07 at 19:33:29: for the past few months i’ve definitely still been interested in the fundamental nature of reality... but much more as a scientist than anything else

2022-04-07 at 19:28:46: have a feeling that my interest in mysticism and spirituality may have a resurgence after today

2022-04-07 at 19:27:15: @rhymeswithvocal what’s an aspiration you do have?

2022-04-07 at 19:23:27: “ah yes,” says your brain caught in self-criticism, “i need you to prove to me *right now* that you are not fallible in the ways you have been conditioned to be fallible over the course of your *whole life*. give yourself space and time? absolutely not!”

2022-04-07 at 04:32:28: @nickcammarata brooooooo 😍

2022-04-07 at 04:19:54: okay doin it 🤞! https://t.co/7NHREDc2Xp

2022-04-07 at 03:51:32: those of you who live with your partner, how regularly do you shower with them?

2022-04-07 at 03:00:48: gonna try morels for the first time tonight! foraged and sautéd by my friend!

2022-04-07 at 02:22:32: our aesthetic preferences are our mirror neurons reflecting what out in the real world is subtly the same as our essence

2022-04-07 at 01:51:04: how far on average does a bumblebee fly from its hive???

2022-04-07 at 00:42:49: feelin like a proper phd trainee this week (good)

2022-04-06 at 23:28:40: @powerbottomdad1 exactement!

2022-04-06 at 23:15:29: when she has a good head on her shoulders but uses the word “utilize” 😭

2022-04-06 at 22:28:35: looove cleverly designed in vitro experiments

2022-04-05 at 18:36:30: often when i drink cacao it either gently or aggressively nudges me towards pro-social behavior

2022-04-05 at 18:28:37: after almost a year away from the field, i think in a few months i’ll feel ready to start engaging with the fert*lity startup space again

2022-04-05 at 18:26:11: i generally feel better once i hurl myself into what the day demands of me

2022-04-05 at 18:23:18: i was trying to wrap my head around a project looking at the rate of Ras-mediated membrane polarization (i fuckin love the plasma membrane); getting answers about a sub field of syn bio i’ve wanted to know about for AGES

2022-04-05 at 18:22:25: bruhhh my heart is happy just thinking about that conversation. i was laughing hard and thinking deeply

2022-04-05 at 18:19:37: that person i vaguely knew and his roommate and i are all biologists and we talked emphatically, curiously, and with humor about biology: facets of the field and the projects we’ve worked on/work on now. i didn’t know talking casually about biology could be so fucking fun

2022-04-05 at 18:17:15: friend had a party a few nights ago and a person i vaguely knew recognized me by my voice

2022-04-04 at 04:58:18: it’s been a while since i’ve looked at my hair and thought it looked really good. what gives. my hair’s wavy so sometimes it makes really lovely waves, and curls at the end, but as of late not so much...

2022-04-03 at 21:48:46: unfortunately for me the weather is nice and the undergrads are back so this may prove to be harder than expected

2022-04-03 at 21:47:45: cool cool cool just have to find a secluded place on campus to cry

2022-04-03 at 03:57:32: i got back to the oakland airport the morning of december 31st, coming off of a sleepless night in las vegas and i was moved by the sunlight, greenery, and familiar hills to the east; i felt this grand sense of homecoming

2022-04-03 at 03:54:24: same me coming home to the same airport, same landscape, same hills same monorail connector same train station

2022-04-01 at 23:17:16: @rhymeswithvocal tangential: look at this man wearing orange corduroys! made my day https://t.co/gAFYTBUfMs

2022-04-01 at 22:19:49: i’m leading a project that’s at the edge of my abilities, will be carried out over the next month; i alternate between 

-&gt; feeling amazing about it &amp; about how it’s pushing me
-&gt; feeling despair, “i’ve bitten off more than i can chew”, execution so much harder than ideation

2022-04-01 at 19:40:54: @isosteph aw steph gets tender™️

2022-04-01 at 19:38:03: @Prigoose @powerbottomdad1 hph ftw

2022-04-01 at 17:45:22: @sunofdopamine - first time feeling intellectually “okay” when i don’t know everything immediately

- slowly letting the complexity of the subject matter permeate my mind; grasping gently, patiently for understanding

- acceptance of my own ignorance, understanding of how knowledge accumulates

2022-04-01 at 17:43:07: @sunofdopamine for me, i’ve been feeling (1) as i’ve started to work in a basic science research setting (prev experiences were all more engineering)

2022-04-01 at 17:40:04: @sunofdopamine would love to hear about (1) when you first got inklings of being able to hold things in your mind in a way that was different from before, and/or (2) the ways in which your mentor(s) have shaped you

2022-04-01 at 17:37:53: @sunofdopamine yeah wow all of these are great. varying degrees of resonance with each point for me right now

2022-03-31 at 18:10:36: @sunofdopamine i’m in the process of developing this ability and i’ve often lamented my inability to “think”. thanks for putting this into words :-)

2022-03-27 at 23:54:46: gripped by the desire to learn the names of all the clouds

2022-03-27 at 22:35:07: perhaps you have to cultivate the ability to hear your heart’s calling, because what your heart calls for is what you are most able to do; and with attention your heart’s whispers will become calls

2022-03-27 at 02:25:28: love and i are having separate social evenings 400 mi away from each other! it’s nice to line up schedules and energy ebbs and flows when we can

2022-03-27 at 00:20:52: how impactful/catastrophic would it be if the earth’s magnetic poles just spontaneously switched?

2022-03-26 at 21:54:53: just getting this straight: animals that hibernate don’t just go to sleep for months straight, right?

2022-03-26 at 21:50:11: @empathy2000 incredible photo, sweet gesture!

2022-03-26 at 21:25:25: babe this is what i’m gonna look like on our wedding day - what, you don’t like it? it’s traditional! https://t.co/jcYQD61aK1

2022-03-26 at 20:44:44: @jonathandubin ime often i just need one activity to start the “virtuous spiral” - run, meditate, start an intellectual task. then i become more inclined towards action and things fall into place

2022-03-26 at 17:04:21: @coladaclan yes!

2022-03-26 at 05:25:33: @startuployalist convos w bushra do tend to do this

2022-03-25 at 04:46:10: @profeshkitten i will not be doing a major move (maybe across the bay but no further) in at least the next 5 years 😅 so i’m happy to accumulate little lovely things

2022-03-25 at 04:44:45: @profeshkitten open 2 anything! decor (your taste is 👌), knickknacks, plants, even clothes if ur downsizing your wardrobe at all, etc. i’m prob not the best fit for plants in need of major tlc and/or plants toxic to cats :’)

2022-03-25 at 04:32:48: @profeshkitten if u have any pretty things u wanna pass on hmu hehe

2022-03-25 at 02:35:10: @jonathandubin i’ll b there :-)

2022-03-25 at 02:13:28: hard to believe this is home. often my life here sparkles but sometimes it inevitably feels dull

2022-03-24 at 05:35:36: cleaned n decorated my living room a bit and now i want to host a little gathering this weekend

2022-03-24 at 05:07:42: there’s a funny thing that happens when you’re a phd student rotating through labs. provided the rotation is going well enough, people in the lab will gently joke about *when you join the lab*. and you have to pretend you have no clue where you’re gonna end up

2022-03-24 at 04:56:31: i love when my mind allows me to more or less effortlessly string together actions

2022-03-24 at 03:55:11: @altsanabo 😂!

2022-03-24 at 03:48:27: @altsanabo p &lt; 0.05 ???

2022-03-24 at 03:46:36: @dendricide yeah it’s the life force present in the food. i’ve heard from practitioners that microwaving zaps prana, so to avoid it

2022-03-24 at 03:45:43: i’m interested all of a sudden in how the body handles and uses salt

2022-03-24 at 03:40:05: wonder what’d happen if you ran a blind test to see how people feel eating a diet of food w/ prana versus food without prana

2022-03-23 at 18:34:56: @Probably_Brian love! 💗💗💗

2022-03-23 at 04:05:06: @Probably_Brian a patch of two familiar flowers

2022-03-22 at 23:25:15: i’m not tryna get to biological insights thru high-throughput assays i’m tryna find creative ways of repurposing tools to elucidate biological insight!

2022-03-20 at 18:28:12: @Cantide1 ah i mean i can’t wait to live with my partner but it’s just not possible right now. so i’ve gotta reframe in a positive way

2022-03-19 at 23:12:38: might have to stop by one of the hippie shops on south side... the gravitational pull is undeniable. i’ll grab some nag champa incense if i can

2022-03-19 at 22:17:37: growing up my parents would give me a bed of my own in the garden, a little one where i’d get to choose the flowers and herbs. buried my first goldfish in my flower bed

2022-03-19 at 22:16:19: might take on a little gardening project to transform the little green plot behind my apartment building

2022-03-19 at 21:12:42: i actually really love long distance. i think it’s allowed our relationship to grow and evolve as it needed to

2022-03-19 at 20:25:42: @Malcolm_Ocean no rats in alberta!

2022-03-19 at 06:10:18: it was you who knitted me together in my mother’s womb

2022-03-19 at 05:55:40: i don’t like ipas and i don’t like dnb

2022-03-19 at 05:14:20: what type of writing most reflects the way that life is?

2022-03-19 at 04:41:57: @_brentbaum 😂👌

2022-03-19 at 03:55:29: practicing my go-to karaoke song in the shower in case it becomes necessary during lab retreat this weekend...

2022-03-19 at 03:50:30: want to do a dancing container experience soon!

2022-03-19 at 03:17:50: fit, outdoorsy partner; fit, outdoorsy boss; friend with a quiet but deep passion for running; recent doctor’s appointment where the power of fitness to balance out prior blows to my body was emphasized; friends planning backpacking trips; dad’s gentle nudging

2022-03-19 at 03:11:29: @mclegibilist hey crispy i think im gonna try and put together a “who i am/what i’m about on here” thing too

2022-03-19 at 02:11:48: if rhcp goes on tour again i’m getting friggin GA tickets

2022-03-19 at 01:30:15: @chercher_ai aha, yes :) thank you for explaining!

2022-03-19 at 01:19:41: @chercher_ai curious what you mean by re-learning &amp; the hard way

2022-03-19 at 00:16:50: how do your feelings towards your work fluctuate?

2022-03-18 at 23:02:37: @keta_mean_ before this i was like hm yellow or white could be nice

2022-03-18 at 23:01:32: @keta_mean_ this set of photos singlehandedly convinced me that i have to wear a red lehenga when i get married

2022-03-18 at 21:44:29: @er1enney0ung @willlowthewhisp a little dark for sure

2022-03-18 at 21:44:13: @er1enney0ung @willlowthewhisp it’s called “sleep” haha

2022-03-18 at 21:42:35: truly every book i read becomes a journey i go on

2022-03-18 at 20:36:10: (i'm the biologist of the pair and my partner is the computational one. we're gonna do some fancy microscopy!)

2022-03-18 at 20:25:46: have a final project to do for one class. the instructors paired people up based on complementary expertise - and i think this works remarkably well!

2022-03-18 at 20:19:29: @isosteph my condolences!

2022-03-18 at 18:46:15: @willlowthewhisp reminds me of murakami short story where protagonist doesn’t sleep for days on end and instead stays up &amp; reads anna karenina :)

2022-03-18 at 17:26:13: @nvpkp i think i might be too early in my unfolding to know

2022-03-18 at 02:26:30: :) :) :)

2022-03-17 at 19:37:00: i'm at the stage of prepping now where the groundwork has been laid, and now i just get to use my innate sense of aesthetics to figure out how best to lay out slides and present information. so fun!

2022-03-17 at 19:34:01: @noampomsky wow now i want a similarly shaped shelf situation to decorate

2022-03-17 at 19:31:36: so cute how hard bf tries to win over the cats he meets. he succeeds too!

2022-03-17 at 19:01:42: it's all about creating a clearer channel

2022-03-17 at 19:00:23: 😅😅😅☺️

2022-03-17 at 18:57:26: i'm giving lab meeting later today. what that means in practice: i'll be thinking out loud in front of ten people for at least an hour

2022-03-17 at 07:45:25: @Malcolm_Ocean o that looks cool. eg 

https://t.co/FqIbDamqUl

2022-03-17 at 07:05:24: well past my bedtime listening to psychedelic pop obsessively watching videos of cells moving

2022-03-17 at 02:40:00: i’m becoming healthier! more integrated! more passionate! more honest - to myself and others

2022-03-17 at 02:36:26: i’ve already grown so much since i began last fall!

2022-03-17 at 02:34:52: i am grateful and gaining confidence and agency and learning how to follow and trust my curiosity and learning how to do things with love at the center (yes, in science!)

2022-03-17 at 02:33:31: so many budding thoughts i wanna share about how my relationship to science is evolving! but i must focus on my work today!

2022-03-17 at 01:57:07: have an exam and a presentation tomorrow.... maybe if i got out of my head and out of my own way i could actually make progress on preparing 😇

2022-03-16 at 04:51:51: @jimperio here! stands out in memory as a vivid description https://t.co/WfxeMryCHN

2022-03-16 at 04:49:41: @jimperio ohhh this reminds me of a bit from buddhism plain and simple lemme find it

2022-03-16 at 01:59:31: @mechanical_monk u got this! sweet dreams 😴

2022-03-15 at 20:22:44: @embryosophy omg today is my roommate's cat's 1st bday! what a coincidence :o

2022-03-15 at 19:17:28: every so often i feel as though my partner is me in another body

2022-03-15 at 19:15:17: in my dreams last night i flew cross country for a weekend, brought my cat along and paid $95 each way to do so, went to a rave but abstained from substances, and tightly hugged my father

2022-03-15 at 19:12:31: increasingly i believe in the value of any action you can take to ease anxiety and thereby enable clearer thinking

2022-03-15 at 18:00:52: @nvpkp initially the phrasing of this question didn’t quite resonate with me. i don’t conceptualize love *as my life’s work*, but all my work is made better when i do it with a heart full of love

2022-03-15 at 07:22:37: i be striving with the waxing gibbous

2022-03-15 at 04:33:17: @Virtual1nstinct 🤞🤞🤞🙏🏽

2022-03-15 at 03:43:57: i just get so stoked when i meet someone i vibe with professionally and personally

2022-03-15 at 01:51:06: connected with an old acquaintance and made a friend out of a recent acquaintance! a successful afternoon if i do say so myself

2022-03-14 at 03:19:23: @jimperio i appreciate the specificity/granularity!

2022-03-14 at 03:16:50: @jimperio oh these are excellent!

2022-03-14 at 03:16:02: you know you’re onto something when you find your way into sustaining cycles

2022-03-14 at 03:02:26: @eIfcup oh the prairies 🤍

2022-03-14 at 02:59:39: @myceliummage @Tjdriii @reconfigurthing bruhhh

2022-03-14 at 02:59:15: how do you know if you’re striving enough

2022-03-14 at 02:55:45: i’ve benefited tremendously from pre-labeled cell lines - eg imaging protein dynamics while applying a mechanical perturbation to cells. but i have no idea how to actually label a protein of interest! i don’t think it can be that hard...

2022-03-14 at 02:53:53: hello are there any biologists in the house who can tell me what the methods look like to label (for imaging) a protein/protein complex in a cell line?

2022-03-14 at 02:47:00: i love learning to live in this body

2022-03-14 at 02:44:02: switched music four times to get exactly the right vibe i wanted to experience this sunday evening while cleaning my room and fending off the sunday scaries - and arrived at a perfect fit, tasshin’s metta dance party playlist :’)

2022-03-14 at 02:37:48: @mclegibilist academia i think can be an interesting topic bc perceptions of it change with time &amp; experience

2022-03-14 at 02:36:06: @mclegibilist oh your thread of crystallizations was dope btw

2022-03-14 at 02:35:27: @mclegibilist crispy, i see you on here and think positively of you - but i am not sure what you’re “about”! i recall your productivity log threads; you seem like a graduate student/adjacent - perhaps some opinions about academia / how you view your place in it?

2022-03-13 at 19:45:04: time to pull a murakami and exorcise the negative energy inside me by running to rhcp

2022-03-13 at 02:10:52: @eIfcup hips expanding! so it’s possible?! i’ve had an inkling that it’s possible but i haven’t wanted to hold onto false hope

2022-03-13 at 02:00:05: my partner made the great outdoors accessible to me. i feel immense gratitude for the opening of that gateway. may we continue to open greater and greater yet gateways of experience for one another

2022-03-13 at 01:52:46: it feels as though the universe is gently conspiring to ensure my physical fitness

2022-03-12 at 22:47:03: when/if i move back into the city, i will resume my periodic visits to the haight street goodwill. that place slaps

2022-03-12 at 20:39:41: given that qualia / experience is malleable, where do you get leads on how to mold your experience?

2022-03-12 at 19:19:11: @danielifidare ♥️ sending love and strength.

2022-03-12 at 08:24:06: @er1enney0ung felt better after calming down and several sips of a cold bier! 🤍

2022-03-12 at 06:39:22: am a lil too high, throat burning

2022-03-10 at 20:56:33: love how science comes to life when you talk to the people who are working on it - i’ll sit through a presentation and grasp only bits and pieces - but in a one-on-one convo i’m filled with wonder and greater understanding

2022-03-10 at 18:45:26: @VividVoid_ noice

2022-03-08 at 22:54:29: 7. lunch today; mac n cheese with cauliflower and chickpeas, based on avantgardevegan recipe; didn’t have sundried tomatoes so used kokam instead, which worked (!); added lemon at the end which enlivened other flavors https://t.co/rm9EkaB3Pa

2022-03-08 at 08:14:37: 6. ramen for two for lunch today; quite pleased with broth (tahini-miso base) and mushroom topping; needed a bit more protein to keep me full for longer afterwards; also would choose smaller greens / cut em smaller https://t.co/fOE2iDhIIM

2022-03-08 at 07:26:44: lately i have been seeking oneness while doing various activities: cooking, driving, conversing, eating, reading papers, etc

2022-03-08 at 06:57:13: news about a parent’s health last week totally tanked my motivation. weed fucks wit motivational circuits. das all i know rn

2022-03-08 at 06:52:43: i’m grateful to be a student and to be paid for it. i wonder if a sign of me maturing scientifically/professionally will be a growing dissatisfaction at the grad student salary

2022-03-08 at 04:07:58: i would like my motivation to be more consistent

2022-03-08 at 03:11:19: heart bursting

2022-03-08 at 03:11:05: we are at the conclusion of an absolutely amazing weekend spent together with bf

2022-03-07 at 23:29:40: i’m looking forward to being an affectionate mum

2022-03-07 at 23:25:33: if you live in the bay area and haven’t gone outside yet today, please, i implore you, go outside and feel the sun on your skin. the weather is glorious

2022-03-07 at 21:24:07: at five leaving first grade early each afternoon to drive into the city for radiation treatment

2022-03-07 at 05:44:06: @eIfcup more power to ya 💗

2022-03-07 at 02:23:49: @nat_sharpe_ @gptbrooke nat your coustume in all its glory!!! and brooke OMG 😍😍😍

2022-03-07 at 02:23:27: @nat_sharpe_ @gptbrooke WOAH

2022-03-07 at 02:23:12: i love the post vibe camp mems and memes that are emerging :’)

2022-03-05 at 17:41:01: @christineist @altsanabo pranab’s famous chai!

2022-03-05 at 05:33:24: turns out i don’t have the strongest aptitude to work on tech that would directly benefit her 😅 but that’s ok 😌

2022-03-05 at 05:28:59: when my mom first got sick ~2 years ago, i funneled my energy into: “i’m going to reduce her suffering by working directly on things that will help her be less sick”

now i’m more like: i’m going to help her by flourishing &amp; by finding deeper ways to connect w/ and support her

2022-03-05 at 05:16:36: @alth0u love this for u

2022-03-05 at 05:14:49: god be guiding me, god been guiding me

2022-03-05 at 05:14:28: there were also two coincidences that arose in our conversation that convinced me that my path is meant to intertwine with this professor

2022-03-05 at 05:12:30: mundane snapshots https://t.co/AFRXCb5Crh

2022-03-05 at 05:10:40: in our 1-1 mtg earlier today, professor said that people in the lab resonated with me - my enthusiasm and curiosity 🥺

2022-03-05 at 05:09:06: @eIfcup never had red rose but it looks trustworthy.....

2022-03-05 at 04:52:26: :) https://t.co/VtjQP7j7Jf

2022-03-05 at 04:20:57: and i just lit sandalwood incense in the living room to make it smell special :)

2022-03-05 at 04:16:38: i love getting dressed all cute to pick him up the airport. reminds me of our cross country long distance days. i’m gonna wear my dangly heart earrings tonite

2022-03-05 at 04:02:11: @er1enney0ung hopefully the ...... 30mph winds are enough to win him over

2022-03-05 at 04:01:28: @er1enney0ung he’s flying up from ur region of the state to my region of the state ;)

2022-03-05 at 04:00:00: @ElodesNL woah that rings so true

2022-03-05 at 03:59:11: @ElodesNL dying doubtful but i do get lightheaded for 10-20 min after having food that’s too spicy for me

2022-03-05 at 03:58:09: @ElodesNL how’s your tummy? spicy food can sometimes eff up digestion

2022-03-05 at 03:56:58: we haven’t seen each other for a month :’)

2022-03-05 at 03:56:19: i get to snuggle with bf tonite!

2022-03-05 at 02:37:46: @eIfcup oh very fair

2022-03-05 at 02:36:21: @eIfcup i’m always looking out for &gt;30% wool sweaters in nice colors

2022-03-05 at 02:35:48: @eIfcup if it’s insanely windy like today they might actually b nice

2022-03-05 at 02:28:33: rhcp has quietly released two new singles and i unabashedly really like them

2022-03-04 at 21:59:07: love is attachment, service, union

2022-03-04 at 21:57:18: wondering today if the way a man loves and the way a woman loves are fundamentally the same or different

2022-03-04 at 21:09:11: https://t.co/yko10J3oB9

2022-03-04 at 20:52:34: @ElodesNL all pics are from this book - i wish i had a more specific link to point you to! https://t.co/g48UuUVnFJ

2022-03-04 at 08:56:15: ☺️ https://t.co/UOAt3cCJFE

2022-03-04 at 04:33:13: @choosy_mom what did u have?

2022-03-04 at 04:30:17: @cIass_man @Endymion1989 what on earth is that

2022-03-03 at 22:40:13: @gracemercur hahaha enjoy the ride ☀️

2022-03-03 at 21:49:00: RT @carmenleelau: Coming out of a recent slump, I’m again discovering that if I’m languid and stagnant, it’s probably because the vision I…

2022-03-03 at 21:37:42: @erienneyoung mmmf siberian iris das one of my mom’s fav flowers 🥺

2022-03-03 at 21:26:46: i never understood black pepper until one fateful day when i ground some onto a sunny side up egg

2022-03-03 at 04:00:10: my ambitious plans for this evening consist of doing my homework then covering the east wall of my bedroom with photos of flowers

2022-03-03 at 02:18:44: the way that life unfolds is so beautiful

2022-02-28 at 23:31:07: @christineist lil slice of bringing a part of romance to other relationships: https://t.co/CMI3sC74KD

2022-02-28 at 23:27:16: @christineist if u don’t mind me askin what kind of scary things!

2022-02-28 at 23:25:51: lots of warm fuzzy feelings of home this week. leaving my parents place now, which makes returning to my home and my cat even sweeter; and this weekend bf comes to visit!

2022-02-28 at 17:42:16: 💗💗💗 https://t.co/pL6aNMPoyW

2022-02-28 at 17:42:00: @tasshinfogleman love this so much. well done tasshin and all those involved!

2022-02-28 at 17:41:20: @tasshinfogleman holy fuck

2022-02-27 at 19:37:21: @willlowthewhisp that late afternoon light is sublime!

2022-02-27 at 19:27:48: @startingfromnix @david_perell how has your writing voice evolved with time; can you place yourself in one or more of the three parts?

2022-02-27 at 06:41:01: @_brentbaum lowkey tho norwegian wood was way more sexual than i expected

2022-02-27 at 06:40:31: @_brentbaum i’m starting “what i talk about when i talk about running”

2022-02-27 at 06:39:37: @_brentbaum i’m maybe 3/4 through a book of his short stories, where the book is called “the elephant vanishes”, i think after one of the stories

2022-02-27 at 06:38:50: @_brentbaum so i read norwegian wood over last christmas and loved it. it was so vivid! and explored themes in a way that felt new and exciting at each turn

2022-02-27 at 00:52:39: all i know is all i know

2022-02-26 at 21:20:36: @xiexiexiexiex struck me as a middle way of sorts between feeling and reasoning

2022-02-26 at 21:19:58: @xiexiexiexiex in yogananda’s interpretation of first verse of gita, he writes that the way to make decisions is from feeling/intuition grounded in clarity of mind/being (buddhi)

2022-02-26 at 08:42:40: @startuployalist such an elegant and sweet lil cake 😍

2022-02-26 at 08:42:13: @startuployalist happy birthday! 💝🥰🥰🥰

2022-02-25 at 08:36:30: @_StevenFan i think so, but i am very sleepy right now so i will revisit when awake :)

2022-02-25 at 07:08:01: deeply deeply comforted within the first few seconds of reading murakami and recognizing his voice

2022-02-25 at 05:47:19: getting that macarthur yellow orange transfer by seconds is so satisfying

2022-02-25 at 05:18:52: we’re in that last 10 minute dash til i have to run to the train to get to the airport to fly across the country!

2022-02-25 at 01:45:16: @_StevenFan this sounds like a cool thing to realize and i want to understand!

2022-02-25 at 01:44:46: @_StevenFan can you please give an explanation/example of how inverse kinematic planning plays out?

2022-02-25 at 01:43:34: previously i’ve idealistically thought i’ll learn music theory while learning guitar from scratch but then there are two unfamiliar things to surmount: guitar playing and music theory. with singing, that’s something i already enjoy/feel drawn to

2022-02-25 at 01:42:40: realistically my way into learning more musical theory would be learning it while improving my singing - gaining more control over and familiarity with my voice

2022-02-25 at 01:30:44: if i had to describe what this discovery felt like to me - i have a recurring dream where i’m running through an interesting landscape, and i can run endlessly without getting tired. that’s what science feels like to me

2022-02-25 at 01:25:03: i think my first personal discovery of this year was finding that the practice of science suits my way of being far more than the practice of engineering

2022-02-24 at 04:48:16: real decaf green tea in the shower hours out here

2022-02-24 at 04:44:31: fuckin sublime

2022-02-24 at 02:56:18: why are my neck n shoulders so crackly upon waking up and how can i make them not be like that 🧐

2022-02-24 at 02:52:29: @myceliummage i’m doin it i’m doin it. music or no music?

2022-02-24 at 02:47:43: don’t want 2 go for run but i knooow i’m gonna feel so good after and it’s gonna make my sleep better

2022-02-23 at 22:33:03: jk i got some fun data

2022-02-23 at 03:18:35: @disconcerta omg i thought your dad was you! so sweet

2022-02-23 at 03:07:16: @eggprophet last week on my bus rides home, the sunset sky westward was yellow and eastward it was pink

2022-02-23 at 03:06:45: @eggprophet ♥️♥️♥️

2022-02-22 at 22:50:27: yea i’m still grappling with tendencies towards aversion and despair and maybe not having a robust way to process those emotions, but life is still good

2022-02-22 at 22:06:03: week’s off to an okay start, have deadlines, feel doubtful about how much science i’ll get to do, but hey at least i get to hug my momma this weekend

2022-02-22 at 21:49:05: this is one of the great challenges of long distance

2022-02-21 at 07:36:32: @xiexiexiexiex hmmm good point. plants just die if cold

2022-02-21 at 07:11:06: @xiexiexiexiex i love u

2022-02-21 at 04:14:06: @eggprophet what is your favorite color for the sky to be

2022-02-21 at 02:16:34: (2) is there a plant material out there that can retain heat like down, such that you could put it in a puffy jacket and trust it to keep you warm? does anything come close?

2022-02-21 at 02:15:41: two questions about down:

(1) why is it so good for retaining heat anyways? eg down jackets, comforters, sleeping bags

(1.1) what’s the difference between the down in a sleeping bag rated for 32F versus say -15F or colder? quality? quantity? source?

2022-02-21 at 01:26:52: i’m spending today cleaning my physical spaces so that tomorrow i am able to better focus on mental tasks

2022-02-20 at 19:53:04: androgynous love

2022-02-20 at 19:31:32: it’s been a while (a few days to a week) since i’ve sat down and focused on something (writing, problem set, embroidery). this is silly given how good sitting down and focusing makes me feel

2022-02-20 at 00:50:28: the yellow/orange dress thing is a bit of a gamble. no returns! the way i’m styling it in my head will either be amazing or terrible in reality

2022-02-20 at 00:47:26: i just spent $17 at goodwill and am quite pleased with my acquisitions (heeled boots, uniqlo windbreaker, glass food bowl for my cat, fun yellow/orange translucent dress thing that will make for a fun party outfit)

2022-02-20 at 00:43:16: imagine if telephone poles were real living trees

2022-02-20 at 00:40:47: hai i hope ur having a splendid saturday

2022-02-19 at 20:42:13: don’t really care abt the next big thing just wanna find &amp; do what i love, and let the purity and peace at my core emanate outward

2022-02-19 at 05:06:52: 10 minutes into a party and a man has sent me a paper https://t.co/RICWjtKtWE

2022-02-19 at 04:18:39: are you sober at this moment?

2022-02-18 at 22:33:25: okay wisp, let’s eat, and perhaps then we can disentangle those downstream worries

2022-02-18 at 22:32:23: well, the wisp says: the thing you’re trying to learn right now, i want to learn it, but we aren’t giving it our all... probably because we’re hungry

the wisp continues: and i’m afraid we’re not going to have a good weekend, and i’m afraid your roommate is not happy with us

2022-02-18 at 22:32:22: to that wisp of unhappiness coloring my experience, i ask gently: why are you unhappy?

2022-02-18 at 19:31:40: @AstralPJs @goblinodds haha it terrifies me too. i think this idea is particularly good for long term couples who want to build a little intimacy &amp; cultivate vulnerability

2022-02-18 at 19:11:18: @joespurpleshirt (thank you for this probing question! 💗)

2022-02-18 at 19:08:15: @joespurpleshirt taking away from other things can look like - mounting anxiety because i’m letting small tasks build up; not cooking &amp; feeding myself as well as i’d like to (losing that prized rhythm of cooking &amp; feeling nourished &amp; prepared for the day ahead); fewer dreams

2022-02-18 at 19:05:40: @joespurpleshirt the other thing: i know dependence is happening when i feel my usage taking away from other things in life. weed is lovely but it sure can fuck with my motivational circuits

2022-02-18 at 19:04:13: @joespurpleshirt so two things come to mind: one is the way that i relate to craving. the desire strikes me, and w/o dependence i am more able to hold the craving and evaluate my desire. with dependence, the craving become almost a compulsion, where it’s like “i want it, so i need it”

2022-02-18 at 19:01:59: @taalumot oh my goodness, how grand!

2022-02-18 at 19:00:26: @_TamaraWinter omg how was it! been wanting to visit for a while. did you go to bombay beach?

2022-02-18 at 18:57:20: @Lan_Dao_ imo your twitter presence skews more towards a masculine vibe &amp; irl more feminine. does that feel accurate at all?

2022-02-18 at 18:54:20: @Lan_Dao_ ur style is killer and quite feminine for one

2022-02-18 at 18:53:50: @Lan_Dao_ what feminine qualities/traits do you believe you have?

2022-02-18 at 18:44:22: @goblinodds cozy homebody-friendly date: if one of u has a nice camera, set the mood &amp; ambience at home, dress in clothes you feel yourself in, and take pics of one another. capture one another in this moment of time

2022-02-18 at 03:35:09: one time a man of japanese origin told me that my cat looked well cared for and this is a compliment i will never forget

2022-02-17 at 05:28:47: RT @michael_nielsen: I think of Twitter as the online component of a vastly improved offline experience: a better community, better friends…

2022-02-16 at 17:59:51: every so often i develop a little dependence on weed and i can’t imagine i’m unique in this regard. how do you ease yourself out of a dependence?

2022-02-15 at 19:07:34: @RichardMCNgo would you mind elaborating on the diff between tactics &amp; strategies, and/or things that approach strategies?

2022-02-15 at 03:59:32: i wonder if there’s a way to coat a material with another material or mix of materials, such that the strength of the original material becomes much greater - eg something you could paint on a glass cup so it breaks less easily

2022-02-10 at 02:16:56: yesterday i had a funny little interaction where i had to explain myself based on an identity i held months ago &amp; hadn’t given much thought to since then. it was a little awkward. my words didn’t feel completely true

2022-02-10 at 02:02:34: @Malcolm_Ocean when did that album arrive in your life / why do you think it had such a deep impact on you, aside from it being a subjectively good album? :)

2022-02-10 at 01:00:41: @jessicamalonso @embryosophy woah i was just noticing today how positive emotions were distracting me from focusing on task at hand. tried to breathe into them and feel em while not being overtaken

2022-02-09 at 23:35:04: i’m beginning to experience this in my work and it is so effing gratifying

2022-02-09 at 23:34:30: a thing i’ve enjoyed while tripping has been this sublime awareness, acceptance, and fluidity with respect to complexity. everything is complex and i can swim with it

2022-02-03 at 04:34:11: maybe that strange amplified anxiety i feel after a run is just dehydration.....

2022-02-03 at 04:19:32: in that same box i found a sweater that’s 30% wool. you guys think that 30% is enough to make a difference in how warm i feel?

2022-02-03 at 04:18:24: i found some pants in a box of stuff someone had put out by the street,  checked the tag and it’s “54% chanvre” — hemp! this looks to be first item with hemp fabric in my wardrobe, what an exciting thing!

2022-02-02 at 21:48:14: @TylerAlterman @Malcolm_Ocean leaving parents’ house for college. had so much agency i didn’t know what to do with it! built up some bad habits, partied too hard, developed poor impulse control

2022-01-29 at 02:47:50: (2) i’m observing the process of coming to know something complex, which requires patience, sustained curiosity, and humor

2022-01-29 at 02:45:55: (1) i’m figuring out how to hold with equanimity “not knowing”

2022-01-29 at 02:41:11: there is something unfolding within me wrt how i relate to “knowing”

2022-01-28 at 21:02:25: upon getting dressed and leaving the house today i realized that the clothes i chose make me feel like the man version of myself - seven inches taller, long legged, lean framed, academic

2022-01-27 at 20:16:29: give me as much granularity as ya like

2022-01-27 at 20:16:13: how does your energy level generally fluctuate over the course of each day?

2022-01-27 at 07:28:52: @_holyweather @prerationalist we’ve diverged a bit from “art” but those r some musings. feel free to reply to any one of them as desired

2022-01-27 at 07:26:30: @_holyweather @prerationalist aesthetically i really liked that. it’s like walking into, like, a safeway, and you have your usual aisles - coffee/tea/baking, dairy/eggs/yogurt, international foods - and also a “religion” or “prayer” aisle

2022-01-27 at 07:24:39: @_holyweather @prerationalist i suppose hindu idols are like little sculptures, little pieces of art. i walked into a new indian grocery store a few weeks ago and saw they had a whole aisle devoted to prayer materials: idols on idols, cloths of auspicious colors, incense, foods to offer to god

2022-01-27 at 07:19:59: @_holyweather @prerationalist in hinduism there are many different goddesses but this implicit understanding that they’re all the same in essence. it’s interesting how in christianity it’s explicit: there seems to be one main mother figure represented in iconography (afaik)

2022-01-27 at 07:17:34: @_holyweather @prerationalist an example of christian art within art (a book): in hesse’s narcissus and goldmund, goldmund comes across this sculpture of the madonna which moves him deeply, through its rawness and beauty and realism

2022-01-27 at 07:14:02: @_holyweather @prerationalist now if i were to broaden my definition of art and ramble for a little bit...

2022-01-27 at 07:13:41: @_holyweather @prerationalist this question stumped me a little - i guess i don’t normally interface with religion through what i would conventionally consider “art” - namely visual art of different forms. i’d be interested in exploring! but would have to be pointed in the right directions

2022-01-27 at 04:02:04: remember to take care of the things you own so that they can take care of you

2022-01-27 at 02:30:57: do you engage in any acts of rebellion in your daily life? like what? - or, why not?

2022-01-26 at 04:51:44: @mosephos fuck yeah!

2022-01-26 at 04:47:05: if you’ve marveled at and internalized the complex structures of even your simplest cells (eg red blood cells, with their mere actin skeletons), hard not to feel blood pulsing under your skin and be aware of its bewitching intricacy

2022-01-26 at 04:44:43: how bout the pursuit of biology as a way to build greater awareness

2022-01-26 at 04:03:12: have a strange urge to mess around with images in matlab or python. tell me some fun things to do to image matrices! convolutions n masks n transforms n whatever else are welcome

2022-01-26 at 03:50:10: @prerationalist @_holyweather still figuring out what deeply relating to god is like in hinduism. i do love how you can choose (or be chosen) by a deity who speaks to something specific. lakshmi - abundance, contentment; brahma - creation

2022-01-26 at 03:48:29: @prerationalist @_holyweather eg - christianity gave me a first glimpse into a deeply personal relationship to god; via internalizing scriptures, via entering dialogue with god through prayer

judaism has that dope relational idea of god, where your relationships with others are key

2022-01-26 at 03:44:40: @prerationalist @_holyweather i do think there’s a lot of richness in comparing the aesthetics of how one relates to god in different religions, which is less material

2022-01-26 at 03:42:45: @prerationalist @_holyweather hehe my first thought here was that the beliefs are all ultimately the same but the “stuff” is materially different and thus has aesthetics that can be compared

2022-01-21 at 03:06:22: evidently my anxiety in this situation behaves like a drug with a come-up. i’m through the discomfort of anxiety building up, rumination; and now the excitement has poked through and anxiety is subsiding (still there, at a low level)

2022-01-20 at 21:20:29: i hope to understand soon what lies in the space between breaths and the pause between chants

2022-01-18 at 23:17:53: find where your motivation is in your body and see if you can coax it into your heart space. results in purer, deeper, ultimately more easeful work

2022-01-18 at 00:07:02: when that voice gets quiet, i can tap into my depths

2022-01-17 at 23:17:08: when that persistent “you don’t know anything” voice in my head gets quiet, suddenly i can relate to the world anew, be a beginner, be grateful for my gifts

2022-01-15 at 01:14:53: grateful, just out of a meeting with supervisor; during our meeting last week my body felt stiff and i was giving myself a headache. this week i felt traces of that but it was way better. getting more comfortable being myself and being intellectually vulnerable!

2022-01-14 at 23:53:28: i’ve seen a recommendation before to avoid intermittent fasting if you’re a woman who’s trying to resolve a hormone imbalance / related health issue. any thoughts on why that would be?

2022-01-12 at 03:23:43: it’s fascinating to observe how i get excited or dismiss an area of research when i don’t know a ton about it -

and then i get a little deeper and my opinion completely changes 🤦🏾‍♀️😂

2022-01-12 at 01:50:57: there was a time where i thought that certain substances were the most straightforward way to connect deeply with people. but shared interests and good questions get you pretty fucking far

2022-01-12 at 01:49:49: in the lab i’ve just started working in, the prof tells new members to start by having a one-on-one conversation with everyone in the lab. grateful to connect with people over shared interests: to hear about the particular scientific intricacy they’ve chosen to pursue

2022-01-12 at 01:40:35: @context_ing despite those constraints there is something that one’s body is uniquely built for :-)

2022-01-12 at 01:10:01: i feel like i’m accumulating safe harbors to return to within myself. i can talk to my parents and get their advice. i can self regulate and read a story i’ve been enjoying. i can self regulate and jump back into a textbook, remind myself i’m alive and vibrant and bright

2022-01-12 at 01:07:40: goddamn i get so bent out of shape dealing with practical stuff - issues with utilities payments, sorting out prescriptions, taxes, etc. but i inevitably bounce back and - once the anxious fog has passed - try to feel kindly and sympathetically towards myself

2022-01-11 at 01:24:51: @bigbabytex @eggprophet super good n super flavorful, if anyone has an instant pot - https://t.co/ufB4kRwH74

2022-01-11 at 01:14:08: regardless of what i transiently feel, i’ve chosen to stake out in the bay for several years, and so the city and i will transform together

2022-01-11 at 01:14:08: there is something about san francisco that inspires a sort of inner polarity for me, where often when i am in the city i think to myself “god i love this place” or “god i can’t stand this place”

2022-01-09 at 06:07:14: have you ever identified as a “sufjan stevens super fan”?

2022-01-09 at 04:30:20: @altsanabo i spontaneously went to have dinner with that friend who lives in the haight! hope you guys have had a lovely lovely night 💕

2022-01-08 at 06:25:16: diggin the new weeknd!

2022-01-07 at 23:34:41: @nickcammarata @mesolude didn’t open twitter tho bc i was focused™️

2022-01-07 at 23:32:22: @nickcammarata @mesolude was sitting in lab 1h ago and thought of these replies when the sun  miraculously appeared !

2022-01-07 at 16:45:11: @alrlodallas 🤷🏽‍♀️ i’d been marinating on it all day and i followed thru this morn

2022-01-07 at 06:53:06: for now at night we’ve got braid hair, brush teeth, and write by hand any bubbling thoughts while sleepiness starts to set in

morning i’m thinkin wake on up, head to kitchen, heat water while taking care of previous day’s dishes; w water ready, make cup o tea &amp; morning pages

2022-01-07 at 03:48:12: @isosteph 🥺

2022-01-07 at 03:47:20: @ArtirKel this is a lovely meme format. i peeked at the paper and saw that there’s a connection between aging and decreased nuclear transport (&amp; nucleocytoplasmic compartmentalization). do you happen to know what’s up with that? (ie why and/or what downstream effects)

2022-01-07 at 02:12:11: when an author’s voice is certain and you trust them it is so comforting

2022-01-07 at 02:02:43: @mesolude @nickcammarata it looks like the sun might come out saturday? hopefully???

2022-01-07 at 01:48:05: anyways time to go home n have dinner then build some mental models

2022-01-07 at 01:47:36: the inspiration happens at a higher level of abstraction

2022-01-07 at 01:43:33: i have this thorough little textbook on gene regulation, but i’ve never gotten much out of it. i’m realizing that the textbook itself is not meant to be inspiring - it’s hard to be inspired by lots of jargon and detailed description of pathways and components

2022-01-06 at 20:35:36: i generally aspire to live a balanced life but i’m hoping that at points during my phd i’ll experience periods of creative insanity

2022-01-06 at 20:23:48: so many times i’ve let transient despair or depression discourage me from taking action!

2022-01-06 at 18:50:15: well it has become evident to me that i need a morning (and also night) routine unless i actively want to be unhinged. drop yours below to inspire me

2022-01-06 at 03:24:15: @gptbrooke this brooke avi is super cute!

2022-01-05 at 23:33:09: @rhymeswithvocal !!! i want in!

2022-01-05 at 21:26:59: @philipggarland thanks phil! ♥️

2022-01-05 at 02:58:54: i’m ready (?) to have daily science work to apply myself to, to feel myself transforming through daily effort and endeavors. but it feels like a necessary precondition is to find something i’m really interested in. and this is a little non trivial

2022-01-05 at 02:49:57: well, there’s a balance to be struck there: ease of care versus quickness of results. plant research takes friggin forever bc plants grow way more slowly than say bacteria. biology inherently involves a slower feedback loop than say computer science

2022-01-05 at 02:48:33: then again, it might not be a bad thing. i realized her work involves embryonic stem cells, which afaik require quite a bit of care. i’d love to work with cell lines / a model system that doesn’t require daily or every other day care

2022-01-05 at 02:46:35: i was super stoked about this project i was gonna work on, but the intended mentor told me yesterday that she doesn’t have the time to take on a student. i was caught super off guard! no one else’s work in the lab fascinates me as much as hers

2022-01-05 at 02:45:22: i’m starting another project (another rotation) this week, and i’m afraid of falling into the same trap. forgetting why i’m in this phd program in the first place. coasting instead of applying myself

2022-01-05 at 02:43:32: simultaneously i realized a few weeks into that project that i wasn’t into it. the work didn’t feel worthwhile - trying to prove a tool the lab had made was useful, while evidence of the tool’s shortcomings mounted

2022-01-05 at 02:41:25: there was a moment last semester where i realized i had overbooked myself socially and wouldn’t be able to devote enough time to thinking about science, preparing for my day to day lab work, going deep. i didn’t really do anything about this

2022-01-04 at 21:19:14: @goblinodds important https://t.co/HoKY7peAfb

2022-01-04 at 01:41:52: so looking forward to getting home and cooking. gonna try a simple pasta dish where you make the sauce yourself. and also gonna make some toor dal with methi to sip on later at night

2022-01-03 at 18:07:21: @MCMCD_ are there any fiction books you’ve been thinking about reading? (i think it’s fun to gather excitement/anticipation before you start reading; also all the better to read a book if someone you love loves or loved that book)

2022-01-03 at 18:02:06: @quotidiania good fuckin question

2022-01-03 at 09:13:06: coming soon to a trail near you https://t.co/bt93pfRMsD

2022-01-03 at 09:11:35: https://t.co/903NE4zERV

2022-01-03 at 09:02:00: now i want to sing on the trail but am too scared to release my full voice for fear of straying off tune, for fear of forgetting the words, for fear of embarrassing myself in front of my friends

2022-01-03 at 09:00:10: my very simple musical goal going into this year is to become confident enough with my singing voice such that i can sing while hiking, in the same way one might whistle along the trail

2022-01-03 at 08:22:19: interesting to observe how readily i am “myself” around different people

had a friend and her partner over for dinner tonight and it was so easy to “be myself” - minimal self-doubt, shared ideas and felt okay with being challenged, took my time to respond

2022-01-02 at 20:06:22: there’s a distinction to be made perhaps in how a couple collectively prepares for marriage versus how each individual prepares

2022-01-02 at 20:04:08: curious about the process of getting ready for marriage. how did you do it, how would you do it, how does your culture prescribe you do it?

2022-01-02 at 17:44:23: @embryosophy i’m hopeful that my next new year’s day will be spent more tenderly with my partner, but this year i’ve got to sort a lot out myself. i’ll be better for it :’)

2022-01-02 at 05:47:19: nye sunset hike :D https://t.co/Nc5hvhmxa1

2022-01-01 at 22:32:03: @DaltonDEmery @rhymeswithvocal LOL

2022-01-01 at 22:31:05: @rhymeswithvocal just a few months into dating, bf tried making me this lamb tagine his mom made. it ended up a bit burnt but it sticks out in memory as a sweet thing for him to do. i’m gonna learn that recipe in good time. i also have to learn how to make pot pie for him

2022-01-01 at 22:28:14: @rhymeswithvocal - i learn recipes waaay better from youtube than from websites. only realized this recently! might help you too. stuff that seems complicated isn’t so bad after all when you can see and copy the way someone else does it

2022-01-01 at 22:26:56: @rhymeswithvocal (2) as i cook more, learn more recipes, feed more people - i feel deeply that i am joining the legacy of my mother and my partner’s mother, becoming a woman who has the ability to prepare nourishing, sentimental, good food. this is a strong source of motivation

2022-01-01 at 22:23:41: @rhymeswithvocal - cooking used to feel like a chore to me too, and occasionally does now. but two mindset things shifted my perspective: (1) cooking and eating well just makes you feel so good - feeling this in my body, in my day to day; and

2022-01-01 at 22:21:09: @rhymeswithvocal - another source for recipes is your childhood. what sorts of stuff did you enjoy eating - stuff that your caregiver(s) made, a favorite dish at a restaurant? i think motivating a recipe like that helps with the fear of failure

2022-01-01 at 22:19:36: @rhymeswithvocal some thoughts:

- do you have friends who like cooking? it’s huge to be around people who love cooking - watch their tricks, pick up recipes they like. i have a friend group where everyone cooks and it’s a constant source of new ideas and inspiration

2022-01-01 at 22:08:49: @rhymeswithvocal what does your relationship to food, eating, cooking look like now?

2022-01-01 at 22:07:01: @monodevice oho 🙏🏽

2022-01-01 at 21:25:36: yesterday i was in the throes of something and all music sounded dull. today i am so receptive! tunes are making me tingle

2022-01-01 at 20:52:23: @carmenleelau feelin v aligned with this!

2022-01-01 at 20:25:16: @embryosophy morning pages, finding and planning recipes i want to make next week, checking and fixing car tire pressure, groceries, calling partner, making a nice dinner, meditating, writing a letter, writing a story. want to do some budgeting too but realistically probs tomorrow!

2022-01-01 at 19:37:09: @DiamonDie i might be learning dev nagari this year too. hadn’t conceptualized it as a goal for this year; but my broader goal is getting better at hindi, and being able to read the script seems like something that’d greatly help learning

2022-01-01 at 19:35:17: back from the holidays, settling into my new place. getting into a good rhythm with cooking feels important and within reach, provided i continue to hold this intention

2022-01-01 at 04:20:05: @JimmyRis 😢 sending strength, hope you get to your destination safe and sound very soon

2022-01-01 at 03:50:48: @nickcammarata it’s ok tho we’re having a really nice call

2022-01-01 at 03:50:30: @nickcammarata he’s in canada at present and they’re delaying and cancelling lotsa flights bc of weather 😭

2022-01-01 at 03:16:08: want to pour all my love into that sweet man

2022-01-01 at 03:14:22: wishing me n luv could have a new year’s kiss tonite but alas we are apart

2022-01-01 at 02:57:50: summer 2022 in berkeley is going to be so lovely! last two summers were spent in san francisco, land of eternal 60 degree weather. summer will feel more hot and vibrant here!

2022-01-01 at 02:48:07: currently gorging on some delicious ramen made by friend &amp; filling my emotional stomach too thanks to conversation i’m listening to https://t.co/wUqltzhTMu

2021-12-31 at 04:45:26: the time has come to become serious, and from that seriousness - industriousness - comes an inner lightness

2021-12-30 at 23:48:10: practical question: if my flight’s been delayed “due to late arrival and weather conditions from a previous sector”, is that considered within / outside of an airline’s control? trying to figure out if i can get any sort of compensation, refund, etc

2021-12-30 at 20:22:08: @gptbrooke ☺️🙏🏽 thank you brooke!

2021-12-30 at 17:59:05: it’s looking like i might be stuck in vegas tonight because of flight delays &amp; missing a connection. any local twitter folk who might be able to have me for a night?

2021-12-29 at 00:10:29: white wintry paradise https://t.co/1FLCeTYZFJ

2021-12-28 at 01:28:44: what is it about yearning that provides solace?

2021-12-26 at 06:08:23: finished it on tuesday. been musing abt midori’s mysteriously endearing irrationality

2021-12-25 at 07:33:29: @dabiiibii @startingfromnix when i was riding BART every day i carried earplugs for this exact reason! that screeching’s painful...

2021-12-24 at 17:58:11: today’s mission: get into canada

2021-12-23 at 20:08:19: no thoughts just last minute gift preparation and holiday cheer

2021-12-21 at 21:42:43: (i know 3)

2021-12-21 at 21:42:13: it’s time to take a peter inventory. how many peters or petes you personally know?

2021-12-21 at 21:38:08: @shahidnowshad i was waiting to hear what you were gonna read next, then i’d decide to read that one too! right now i’m very much still in the throes of norwegian wood. maybe half an hour of reading left to finish it, reiko’s just come to tokyo

2021-12-21 at 19:07:19: @shahidnowshad which one are ya gonna read next?

2021-12-21 at 19:06:28: plus i got to re-organize the contents of my luggage, grab some food, and now sit outside and enjoy this absolutely be-e-eautiful morning in emeryville 🌞 !

2021-12-21 at 18:57:20: i was a little bummed and shaken for a few minutes but now i’m feeling pretty good. life happens! next train’s only 2h later than the original

2021-12-21 at 18:56:30: missed my train by seconds, was hoping for a movie moment where i ran up to the slowly moving train and someone helped hoist me up. instead, the staff member shook his head at me and shrugged as the train slowly left the station

2021-12-21 at 16:49:24: well! thanks guys, you eased any doubts i had

2021-12-21 at 15:01:58: i have a pair of silly sock monkey christmas pajamas. do i bring them to xmas with bf’s family?

2021-12-21 at 06:11:08: i’m halfway thru my first murakami book and i am quite enjoying it

2021-12-19 at 23:48:19: it was perhaps the most successful thing i’ve ever hosted 😌

2021-12-18 at 23:30:30: @altashtree this wee thread was so lovely and resonant i’m tearing up

2021-12-18 at 20:10:56: @JimmyRis do these people exist?!

2021-12-18 at 20:10:26: struck by how when you write fiction you can become someone else, occupy their way of being, their neuroses, their joys

2021-12-18 at 20:02:29: setting up to spend my saturday at home reading and i couldn’t be more excited!

2021-12-18 at 02:23:51: tonight my challenge is to host an all-round nice time. wish me luck!

2021-12-18 at 02:22:31: @joespurpleshirt @Mayameditates welcome maya! looking forward to interacting with you :)

2021-12-17 at 20:48:57: @redcar_tenken noted! yeah, the idea of taking a “sensory inventory” appeals to me, digging deep into my memories and seeing what comes up

2021-12-17 at 11:26:53: @isosteph team woah 1000%

2021-12-17 at 11:18:34: feeling drawn to something amorphous like:

• 100 places i’ve been
• 100 people i’ve known
• 100 sounds i’ve heard

2021-12-17 at 11:12:17: thinkin of doing a belated threadapalooza thang this weekend. any suggestions as to what to do it on?

2021-12-17 at 02:46:01: i’ve recently realized how magical and powerful it can be to bring people together over a delicious meal. that shit slaps

2021-12-16 at 18:34:02: @altsanabo expressing interest in bay area! (and excited to see you soon!)

2021-12-16 at 06:38:46: should i buy an 88 key electric keyboard.......

2021-12-15 at 20:24:04: naw fuck that we gunna have a good ass day today

2021-12-15 at 20:02:52: it was supposed to start raining but the forecast keeps on pushing n pushing back the rain. grateful!

2021-12-15 at 06:36:15: i seem to have come down with a case of the birthday blues :/

2021-12-15 at 02:47:06: @er1enney0ung i find one drink sometimes quiets that anxious inner voice right down, stops me from continuing to get in my own way

2021-12-15 at 02:46:29: @er1enney0ung lolol i’m having a similar experience rn

2021-12-14 at 21:30:32: noticing in interactions with relative strangers, people are more willing to express earnest gratitude or apology than i’d expect!

2021-12-13 at 07:01:32: everything has become beauty

2021-12-13 at 06:35:08: @qephatziel @embryosophy @myceliummage 😭

2021-12-13 at 06:32:55: i’ve pulled the lyrics up on my phone, we’re singing along. my voice isn’t very sure and neither is his, but clearly something very special is happening as we sing together

2021-12-13 at 06:31:48: i’m standing, leaning my back against bf’s chest, it’s sunday night and we’re at our friend’s small house on an isolated property outside of santa cruz. sufjan’s playing off my phone, a song that was special to bf years ago and became special to me because of him

2021-12-13 at 02:58:58: @Probably_Brian are u still in bay area!?

2021-12-13 at 01:05:48: @_rbeny is this a real-life path you traversed?! it's ethereal...

2021-12-13 at 00:55:21: here are two youtube videos i watched recently, and a quote from each which touched me deeply. if you feel drawn to doing so, i'd recommend giving them a watch:

2021-12-12 at 20:55:21: i’m meeting with potential roommates throughout this week. wondering if you all have any clever suggestions: what question(s) can i ask, hypotheticals or other types, to stress-test what conflict resolution might feel like? 😈😇

2021-12-12 at 20:14:25: "you never *need* substances" • our goal is to become as in touch with ourselves as we can • towards inner clarity • take note, is your inner judgement clouded? • is your usage a crutch? • emotional regulation is critical • awareness above all

2021-12-12 at 20:09:09: @RasAlhagve @sadalsvvd u guys are just RADIATING joy &lt;333

2021-12-12 at 20:08:41: @RasAlhagve @sadalsvvd SO cute! SO cozy!

2021-12-12 at 19:53:40: just had a fascinating conversation with relatively new friend who i like and admire, who is generally averse to substances of all kinds. interesting new motivations &amp; perspective now in my mental stew

2021-12-12 at 18:37:29: @gptbrooke feelin grateful for my partner’s supportiveness and enthusiasm

2021-12-12 at 06:31:50: @harveykrishna_ @Prigoose @coladaclan different vibe but i was thinking for the alcohol inclined, hot choc + peppermint schnapps or fireball would be very yummy. i had doubts about a chocolate beverage in a teapot, but fortunately you came and assuaged said doubts!

2021-12-12 at 06:22:13: @Prigoose 😂😂😂♥️! have you served anything in it yet? wondering what the perfect drink to serve in it would be...

2021-12-12 at 06:16:57: @embryosophy related: i saw this tree with multicolored leaves earlier today, generally spanning the spectrum of colors a mango is - green, yellow, orange, a little red. somehow its exquisiteness made my whole body tingle!

2021-12-12 at 06:01:45: examples are endless! three of my female friends/peers each have their fortés and current interests: k’s an incredible self-taught painter; a loves watercolor and chalk pastels; g paints but has an incredible sense for interior design...

2021-12-12 at 05:59:51: the woman whose yard sale i went to today has a love for weaving and free-hand embroidery; the woman whose garage i stopped by for some free stuff earlier today loves painting

2021-12-12 at 05:58:38: as i get more into crafts i feel i’m joining an eternal lineage of crafty women: my mom was a gifted charcoal sketcher before she got married, and now dabbles every now and then; bf’s mom sews tiny bears and fun undies, knits incredible stuffed animals;

2021-12-12 at 05:43:18: brimming with ideas! embroidered hankies for dad &amp; another close friend who uses em. recently found grey crew neck sweatshirt that says oakland. could jazz that up and make it a gift for a dear friend who lives in oakland! have a nice plain black jacket begging for some spice...

2021-12-12 at 05:41:18: i got like 25 colors of embroidery yarn for 2 dollars at a yard sale today. the universe dictates, i listen: i must learn how to embroider!

2021-12-11 at 23:34:42: holy heck upbeat billie marten is speaking straight to my heart, i’ve only heard slow songs of hers

2021-12-11 at 23:09:32: don’t forget that physical clutter is mental clutter!!!

2021-12-11 at 23:06:35: the best sunset time walks are desperately westward, trying to keep the sun in your sight for as long as humanely possible, briskly walking as the yellow in the sky fades fades fades

2021-12-11 at 23:05:30: i’m gonna play some nice music and clean my room while the sun is still up so that i can have nice focused work time once the sun is down. the reward for cleaning my room? a nice sunset-time walk!

2021-12-11 at 22:55:16: i might be the one that got away for a man who existed only on the other side of omegle. we had frighteningly much in common: interests and professional pursuits. felt serendipitous. i told him my name was bonnie. alas, also had to tell him i had a bf!

2021-12-11 at 22:01:43: loosely held misgivings are good, actually, because they let you hone your intuition and they feel SO good when released

2021-12-11 at 20:23:55: let it be known that i am now in possession of a teapot shaped like a duck

2021-12-11 at 05:59:39: @joespurpleshirt oh this sounds like a lovely thing to try (journal prompt!), i’m surprised i haven’t done such a thing despite my general future-orientedness. let me see if i have time to do this tonight or tomorrow...

2021-12-11 at 01:19:50: putting it out into the universe and onto twitter: i’m looking for a roommate for a two bedroom apartment in berkeley, year-long lease starting anytime dec 15 to jan 1. if you or anyone you know is looking for housing, please reach out &amp; we can talk further! ✨

2021-12-11 at 01:14:44: @ElConnekto how do you do this sorcery!

2021-12-11 at 01:14:00: @kehwho absolutely behbeh imo

2021-12-10 at 20:52:18: the reward of the work to make your mind quiet is greater receptivity of the words and calling of the divine

2021-12-10 at 18:16:19: @sadalsvvd 🥺♥️♥️♥️ enjoy the snuggles and all other joys of being together!

2021-12-08 at 08:05:28: @embryosophy a while ago now i did tell love that we needed to unite our consciousnesses and it has been slowly happening...

2021-12-08 at 08:04:18: @embryosophy mind meld 😅

2021-12-08 at 00:18:33: long distance has given me an increased ability to cultivate anticipation and excitement in other social circumstances :)

2021-12-07 at 23:31:44: i’d say that i am more straightforward and direct than average. ultimately makes for more peace and simplicity

2021-12-07 at 23:23:51: @visakanv as your bones get older and your tissues weaker, the ink remains and supports your spirit

2021-12-07 at 23:22:55: @visakanv a thought i often have with tattoos is how they will look as one’s body ages. in that photo i think the tattoo is clearly melded to the subject’s current anatomy. can’t quite tell if it’s going to hold on as the subject ages, but wouldn’t it be lovely if it did?

2021-12-07 at 23:20:45: (by the end of my time at the company i had sort of started to believe that our goal was impossible. i let the flame go out because it was too hard to hold. i’m starting to reevaluate that belief now)

2021-12-07 at 23:18:59: i’d recently experienced psychedelics for the first time and life still felt deeply magical. i was working at a company that was trying to do literal science fiction!

2021-12-07 at 23:17:48: i forever associate this song with reading nexus by ramez naam in the third floor common room of the sf group house i’d just moved into; reading about a future of bio-science fiction and psychedelics and feeling deeply i was living that life right then

2021-12-07 at 22:59:23: a half-baked principle i’ve lived by for around a year now has been to minimize the leakiness of negative valence emotions i experience, towards sorting them out internally to the extent possible w/o burdening others

2021-12-07 at 22:55:22: non-attachment makes feelings much more fun to play with and talk about

2021-12-04 at 01:37:13: @sadalsvvd every time december rolls around i’m like hell yeah this is my favorite month of the year. feelin that way now. oh it’s gonna be nuts, but it’s gonna be great

2021-12-04 at 01:21:28: writing that dissolves the ego, that distills “i” and makes it eternal

2021-12-04 at 00:59:23: @wardnath @tasshinfogleman lol misinterpreted the question, tasshin is a very metta-full account, would 11/10 recommend

2021-12-04 at 00:30:20: @wardnath @RomeoStevens76 @nickcammarata @tasshinfogleman immediately comes to mind!

2021-12-04 at 00:02:40: @elle_nour13 woah that makes sense!!! summer has this dreamlike quality to it for me which makes it hard to accept straightforwardly as serenity

2021-12-03 at 23:56:00: hunger for snuggles intensifies

2021-12-03 at 23:54:52: @elle_nour13 wowow interesting to see euphoria for spring and serenity for summer, i would’ve switched the two ;)

2021-12-03 at 22:57:47: 5. lunch now, eaten straight from the pan; base of couscous made with butter, dill and salt; leftover mushrooms n greens made with coconut aminos; and on top, avocado seasoned with olive oil, salt, pepper, and thyme for a final touch of flavorful fattiness! very satisfying https://t.co/SkvURcQ1NR

2021-12-03 at 22:01:08: fortunately this suggests your inherent goodness, and through meditation, mindfulness, perhaps even a spiritual path of your choosing, you can exist closer and closer yet to your true nature :)

2021-12-03 at 21:59:55: deep down you know what really matters but on a day to day basis, loops of anxiety, avoidance, and reactivity produce a state of confusion: a skewed and ungrounded sense of what matters

2021-12-03 at 21:47:06: though many things are in flux, i have to say life is pretty stinkin good rn

2021-12-03 at 21:33:37: i’m likely soon to be moving into a relatively normal living situation - one roommate instead of 11 (lol), but lessons and ideals and experiences from communal living are very much shaping the sort of home i’d like to create

2021-12-03 at 21:32:06: might write some long form abt this. communal living this past year:

• has given me a strong sense of what *home* can be
• has raised the bar for what *fun* is; for what good communication is
• has enabled the formation of some of the deepest friendships i’ve experienced!

2021-12-03 at 21:27:36: with time it’s becoming more n more evident how impactful and formative communal living has been for me

2021-12-03 at 21:11:36: @taalumot i think it’s dope

2021-12-03 at 17:48:23: we have once again arrived to that part of long distance where ya count down the hours til seeing your person in person. 12 hours to go!!! ☺️

2021-12-03 at 01:15:57: my experiences indicate that when i radiate joy, positivity, and kindness in my demeanor and in my actions, these are reflected back to me in a way that sometimes stuns me

2021-12-03 at 01:14:46: every so often i write an email in which i let myself get a little heated. just sent one off, time to see how the universe responds

those of you with similar inclinations, any guidelines or tricks or materials you employ to stay toasty?

2021-12-01 at 02:44:44: @startuployalist omg excited to see how this enhances your already solid interior aesthetic sensibilities!

2021-12-01 at 02:44:04: long day with some anxious obsession, sitting in gnarly traffic, and meeting new people in a way that was energizing but also draining. now for a rare treat of some fast food

2021-11-30 at 17:04:27: the reason why this is a problem is because with my actions, i begin to favor whichever outcome i’ve become transiently attached to; and neglect the other options, even if they are ultimately just as good or better

2021-11-30 at 16:57:39: in circumstances that involve uncertainty (e.g. waiting to hear back from grad programs, finding a new place to live), 

i have a sticky tendency to attach myself to one of the possible outcomes - even if it’s ultimately not ideal - because that temporarily eases uncertainty

2021-11-29 at 23:02:11: @nvpkp hahaha i was gonna ask for the number! well done diving into that rabbit hole

2021-11-29 at 22:11:37: @gregbglw i’m not sure but this is inspiration for when i next sit down to write

2021-11-27 at 18:18:51: got stung by stinging nettle! 10/10 first plant skin irritation experience. enough to feel perturbed but went away in 30min. plus people in hungary use stinging nettle as a treatment to help rheumatism!

2021-11-20 at 02:47:06: @eggprophet is lichen the same as moss? bc i have a friend who’s got a few tattoos, each of which is plant/mushroom representing a place she was formed by - and for california she’s thinking of a lichen tattoo!

2021-11-20 at 02:26:15: a few days ago i did a 15 minute sit with my dad, and i was able to get surprisingly deep in that relatively short period of time! wonder to what extent his presence helped that happen!

2021-11-20 at 02:15:37: lately i’ve been working on noticing a specific tension that arises in my body when i instinctively put up a front - to appear more palatable, socially acceptable to others, knowledgeable. once i notice, i can often consciously relax this tension!

2021-11-20 at 00:50:14: my next 3 hours, before the evening’s social events:

- sunset walk
- read a little of buddhism book and meditate
- 1-2 pomodoros of presentation prep for monday
- brush my cat
- shower and get dressed up!

2021-11-18 at 20:07:37: @brother_nin what’s your definition of practicing? :)

2021-11-18 at 19:30:18: @nickcammarata finally, i think reading siddhartha earlier this year sowed seeds for my current interest. among other things, i found scenes with the buddha himself to be quite affecting. how he carried himself - what embodied perfection looks like. still think abt it often

2021-11-18 at 19:28:22: @nickcammarata i’ve also dabbled in reading “the tibetan book of living and dying”, which has added some richness to my concept of impermanence, with its focus on death. also, adjacent, “tao of pooh”, which i’m not crazy about but i like some ideas (eg inner nature of things)

2021-11-18 at 19:26:36: @nickcammarata (it’s interesting observing how i’m interacting with buddhist material now, because when i was younger all i knew of buddhism was that my dad was into it and that i didn’t really vibe with it)

2021-11-18 at 19:25:03: @nickcammarata when i mentioned how much i liked long quiet highway, bf found a book on his shelf written by another student of dainin katagiri’s - “buddhism, plain and simple” by steve hagen. i find hagen’s writing very clear and evocative, am currently reading!

2021-11-18 at 19:22:26: @nickcammarata there’s something about witnessing the author’s journey that felt more illustrative / impactful than just reading about ideas. for her, both writing and meditation were ways to explore the expansiveness of mind

2021-11-18 at 19:20:37: @nickcammarata reading “long quiet highway” got me started, it’s autobiographical and the writer chronicles her journeys into writing and meditation; and her relationship with her zen teacher, dainin katagiri

2021-11-18 at 07:52:30: when you go home and brush your teeth before bed, can you stand yourself? can you be awake to yourself?)

2021-11-18 at 07:52:29: (there have been periods where i have felt more or less lonely. i long held on the belief that if i just met enough people, made enough friends i would one day no longer feel lonely. but it is not so! friends’ presences ease that inner critic but —

2021-11-18 at 07:49:13: loneliness is inherent in deep pursuits. eg writing, meditation. so, i guess, find a way to get used to it?

2021-11-18 at 07:46:33: seek oneness; let the experience of oneness be your guiding star. “when i ate that strawberry, i became one with it. even if my attention only lasted for moments, that dissolution of myself felt truer than anything i had experienced before” 🍓

2021-11-18 at 07:16:34: spitballing some lessons from long quiet highway https://t.co/wfv7Ti80FU

2021-11-18 at 06:13:38: way more interested in buddhism than science rn which makes it hard to talk to people about what i do, like yeah i’m using this crispr tool to do that thing, biology is great; but can we talk about impermanence and first thoughts

2021-11-18 at 06:09:19: i’ve been reading voraciously about zen and tibetan buddhism, and i think i’m particularly receptive/ready for their insights/outlook at this moment. exciting to read ideas and feel myself starting to chew on them throughout the day

2021-11-12 at 03:00:16: in love today with how my slender wrists give rise to my gentle and skilled hands

2021-11-12 at 02:55:20: this year, feeling strangely enamored with how early it gets dark

perhaps because in the absence of “real” seasons - seasons are real but the magnitude of warm and cold much reduced - paying attention to daylight and darkness is a way to remain attuned to the passage of time

2021-11-12 at 02:14:51: don’t fuss about quality before it’s time to fuss about quality (which is to say, after you have output and after you’ve found a way to tame that inner critic)

2021-11-12 at 02:12:29: kinda love the way the name joachim sounds. would my hypothetical future son be content with this name, or does joachim fall into the territory of names that get mispronounced/ made fun of?

2021-11-12 at 00:47:41: time for a golden hour tea shop run!

2021-11-12 at 00:44:25: this means you can more effectively target immune cells, such that you harm fewer non-tumor/normal cells

2021-11-12 at 00:43:33: gene circuits? crazy stuff. people are putting AND gates inside of immune cells so that when the cell gets two individual tumor signals (but not one or the other) it activates [kills, releases a drug or other payload, recruits other cells]

2021-11-08 at 01:57:42: though my romantic heart often wants to put him on a pedestal, my love is but a man and i am but a woman; we are at once virtuous and flawed; and by tethering to one another we have found some gravity and peace

2021-11-08 at 01:55:08: new sense recently that we are all floating, floating through this life, tethered by the meaning we make and tethered by the relationships we have

2021-11-08 at 00:38:36: @owenbroadcast this is a super intuitively appealing model, why didn’t it really work?

2021-11-07 at 21:11:03: starting with a simple first step (even if not perfect, even if not as grand as what you envision) allows you to taste the essence of what you’re pursuing

2021-11-01 at 20:54:11: @nibrasibn @michelecanzi i do not doubt that this is true but i would also like to offer an honorable mention to @AskYatharth

2021-11-01 at 04:03:51: @tasshinfogleman (on that note i’m currently working intently on finishing the assignment you gave me late last month :-) )

2021-10-31 at 23:24:19: glad to have words to honor and promises to keep

2021-10-31 at 21:52:01: heart full, may my particular gifts aid me in nurturing and protecting all those i am given the privilege to in this life

2021-10-31 at 21:35:58: @kehwho oh my goodness! would love to know what’s in it, i’ve been curious about homemade hair care recently and your hair is so lovely and well cared for

2021-10-31 at 10:31:02: committing to growing my hair long!

2021-10-31 at 06:32:03: jumped on a big trampoline just now for the first time in YEARS !

2021-10-31 at 00:54:42: thinking fondly of when i spent my first summer far away from my parents, how they took the care to send me spices to cook with

2021-10-31 at 00:37:05: @valor_zhang i’m out of town that wknd! alas

2021-10-30 at 20:30:28: might finally have to leave some gcs im passively a part of bc they make the twitter-checking-experience feel less cozy to me

2021-10-30 at 15:50:37: @AskYatharth this one does something for me esp when i’m feeling a little hot headed

2021-10-30 at 04:03:01: silly how our plans worked out but not complaining as i get to see long distance bf 3 times in november!

2021-10-30 at 00:35:37: @joespurpleshirt @wholebodyprayer (my mom does look strikingly like her, though she denies it vehemently)

2021-10-29 at 23:43:26: when my work day is over i plan to settle into this evening by getting a wee bit high and perusing the tibetan book of living and dying

2021-10-29 at 21:17:39: @danielifidare yes that particular tree was in northern california!

2021-10-29 at 21:10:36: @danielifidare do you know what kind of tree this is? could it be a young white pine? https://t.co/T9J2jEqVd2

2021-10-29 at 20:58:36: @wholebodyprayer never expected to see ma’s face on the TL! ♥️

2021-10-29 at 19:50:21: omg i might go hiking tm morning! finally feelin strong enough for a decent hike

2021-10-29 at 05:52:07: @captain_mrs woah this is wild! my instinct historically has been to make goals more specific in hopes of getting them done

2021-10-29 at 02:51:48: diwali this year is 10 whole days earlier than diwali last year! how am i supposed to keep track of these festivals!

2021-10-29 at 02:18:58: on one hand my brain has this wonderful capacity to generate very good suggestions/instincts for how to, say, decrease anxiety; but the delay between coming up with the idea &amp; *acting* on the idea is often too long for comfort

2021-10-29 at 02:17:16: pondering the relationship between research and creation, not so much how creation works in research but rather how research relates to god’s immense creative potential

2021-10-29 at 00:58:28: the more at peace i am with how transient “feeling good” is - and how in every moment i can take action to influence how i feel - the better “feeling good” feels

2021-10-29 at 00:49:22: so easy to get siloed. make sure you like ur silo

2021-10-29 at 00:08:36: @sadalsvvd @Coscorrodrift i feel like i’m slowly developing an appreciation of astrology from first principles, seeing how it fits into my model of reality. thanks for this thought!

2021-10-29 at 00:03:47: @Coscorrodrift @sadalsvvd wrt astrology there are many transits; i guess i’m curious about the spectrum of periodicity of transits - like my mom has a transit in her chart that shows up 3x in her whole lifetime; versus moon is every month; versus idk what’s goin on with neptune and pluto

2021-10-29 at 00:01:40: @Coscorrodrift you could argue maybe that beyond the moon, other stars n planets implicated in astrology create a degree of rhythm in our lives (what d’you think @sadalsvvd?)

2021-10-29 at 00:00:26: @Coscorrodrift i think for women there’s definitely something rhythmic about moon cycles that people have tapped into to varying degrees, so am curious abt that

2021-10-28 at 23:58:58: @Coscorrodrift super simple example of a little rhythm i’ve created for self: come home, make dinner &amp; pack lunch with excess dinner. so when the next day rolls around, i’m not worried about how i’ll feed myself; i have a meal to look forward to

2021-10-28 at 23:57:51: @Coscorrodrift haha i’m curious about the bad rhythms that came to mind, though you’re right about that not being the exact response i had in mind 😂

in my life i’ve been thinking abt rhythms wrt where i spend my time physically (work/home/away); how i feed myself; social vs alone time...

2021-10-28 at 23:55:38: two dear friends told me once of their view of the world; people strive for some combination of truth, beauty, and goodness. in the moment i thought for sure not truth for me. but it is beginning to seem that i was incorrect about myself

2021-10-28 at 23:53:53: discovering that i do in fact have a deep desire for truth

2021-10-28 at 23:49:09: tell me bout the rhythms in your life: natural rhythms you’ve become aware of, natural rhythms you want to become aware of; rhythms you’ve constructed for yourself, your family, your partnerships...!

2021-10-27 at 22:53:44: @itsLuciKeller oh! i've been actually wanting to get a new credit card - the other one i've been rec'd is chase sapphire preferred (i think). any thoughts on this one versus that one?

2021-10-27 at 22:47:58: scheduled a call with a potential phd advisor for this coming monday. have a really good feeling about this one :3

2021-10-27 at 21:41:45: living today such that i am eager to wake up tomorrow

2021-10-27 at 21:03:49: @ehipassiko444 oh brilliant! perfect suggestion :)

2021-10-27 at 21:01:14: fallback option is a 6pack

2021-10-27 at 21:00:44: stopping by a friend’s place for tacos later, don’t want to show up empty handed

soliciting suggestions for what food would be good to bring/prepare alongside tacos?

2021-10-27 at 06:19:17: @rhymeswithvocal @AskYatharth !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

2021-10-26 at 21:37:12: who am i beneath these emotional tides? (is there an i beneath the budding confidence of an afternoon, the stifling wrath of a morning, the rhythm of tension and ease that stretches over days and weeks?)

2021-10-26 at 20:46:09: entrancing how applied attention can increase quality before your eyes

2021-10-26 at 20:22:58: also makes your self-experiments better bc you have a truer baseline

2021-10-26 at 20:18:32: @alexeyguzey reminiscent of when partner recently ended a phone call with me so he could watch 50 min long video on “most extreme railways”

2021-10-26 at 20:02:42: holy f*ck i just realized a photo of the devi appeared in my dream last night

2021-10-26 at 19:59:08: @_holyweather more or less same i think actually

2021-10-26 at 18:23:52: been a bit since i’ve had dreams with a cohesive narrative, but i have noticed my dream snippets getting more colorful / vivid

2021-10-26 at 05:46:27: for all my aesthetic sensibilities, interior design is something i find quite difficult!

2021-10-26 at 04:05:06: when it comes to tidying, which of these are you by default?

2021-10-26 at 04:02:18: have been feeling stronger in my body for past few days than i’ve felt in months; walking more, moving more

but just reached up and felt an unexpected jolt of pain in region where i recently had medical intervention

body really do be keepin a score

2021-10-26 at 03:50:19: have any of you read “the course of love” by alain de botton? reading it voraciously now, want badly to do a thread on it

2021-10-25 at 08:00:13: @nvpkp chest, throat, all over body; recent experience of chest being filled fully with love &amp; a deep sensation of love in solar plexus

2021-10-25 at 04:19:44: cultivating emotional stability helps you trust yourself more

2021-10-24 at 22:41:51: (@nickcammarata i’m having some moments where i’m able to dissolve the suffering, but it requires conscious attention (not spontaneous); and i’m not sure how long the dissolution lasts yet)

2021-10-24 at 22:40:50: having a simple framework to apply to top-down experiencing seems to be helping. i’m thinking of uncomfortable feelings as having (1) pain and (2) suffering

so if i top-down zoom in on a feeling in my body, i feel the pain &amp; suffering; and dissolve the suffering

2021-10-24 at 22:35:15: i have to intentionally direct myself to top-down experiencing, where the goal isn’t simple understanding

IFS and focusing ask for top-down emotional experiencing; giving feeling(s) space, curiosity, kindness, gentle attention

2021-10-24 at 22:32:55: my instinct is still to try and bottom-up understand my feelings: “what could explain this feeling?”, “what else does that trigger inside of me?”, “what sequence do these feelings occur in?”

2021-10-24 at 21:38:01: don’t forget that your passion and temperament are contagious :)

2021-10-24 at 20:48:19: seems like self breast massage could be a tremendously powerful ritual, both for embodiment and health of tissue

2021-10-24 at 19:49:48: having a little solo dance party for the first time in a while, let’s see if i wake up less stiff in the morning tomorrow!

2021-10-24 at 19:46:53: absolutely insane that there’s someone out there who’s so deeply and steadily at my same wavelength as my partner

2021-10-24 at 18:50:37: internal family systems is all about creating internal feedback systems 🤠

2021-10-23 at 23:40:07: @jongold @profeshkitten (i’ve had the desire to tweet those exact words many a time. may we both get snugs)

2021-10-23 at 22:09:52: man a sense of duty can be super grounding and purifying

2021-10-23 at 19:30:15: blessed to be reminded of this while articulating self and riffing in conversation with a dear friend

2021-10-23 at 19:29:41: reconnected to my sense that i will be okay, because of who i am at my core 😌

2021-10-23 at 17:58:10: feeling SO good after a celebratory night with friends and community ♥️

2021-10-23 at 11:13:21: feeling recently that it is one thing to become aware that you are in deep water - but i am more interested in: how do you keep persisting through the currents?

2021-10-23 at 10:54:32: the thing with getting too comfortable voicing discomfort is that you start having a harder time making yourself experience discomfort

2021-10-23 at 10:50:50: wow am up so late!

2021-10-22 at 18:35:15: may my vision become as clear and indubitable as sanjaya’s

2021-10-22 at 05:56:45: today was one of those days where i had to reconstruct from dust and mirage my sense of reality

2021-10-22 at 04:28:19: we’re gonna stretch this tense little body out real gently tonight

2021-10-22 at 03:24:02: body dislikes false urgency just as much as mind likes creating false urgency :)

2021-10-22 at 01:30:47: how to decide what to work on during phd? — amidst tremendous optionality and a desire to do work that is purely motivated, enjoyable to me, in a sub-field that is *not* densely populated

2021-10-21 at 22:32:06: what’s that tiredness that sits behind the eyes? it is weary, sad, and irritable

2021-10-21 at 00:03:50: glad you guys like this one. it took me months of muddling through amorphous feelings, a serendipitously placed book, and a walk in cloudy weather to distill the above tweet

2021-10-20 at 23:04:28: there are safeguards you have in place to prevent yourself from taking actions you muse about but don’t end up taking

not all inaction is bad!

inaction is the manifestation of gravity in your being

2021-10-20 at 22:49:51: @redcar_tenken lmaooooo love this

2021-10-20 at 22:49:12: @erienneyoung also want to increase elasticity of body both metaphorically &amp; materially

2021-10-20 at 22:48:40: @erienneyoung haha both metaphorical and material. am wondering how body takes care of itself, &amp; if it’s possible to bring awareness to those mechanisms &amp; heighten their action

2021-10-20 at 22:41:36: it is easy to be at home in your body when all is well

2021-10-20 at 22:40:18: how can we grease our joints to ease the wear and tear?

2021-10-20 at 22:37:19: why, i think i do indeed fear death, not the death like a light extinguished in a blink, but rather the death that occurs each day, the rent we pay as we occupy these vessels

2021-10-20 at 22:27:48: (i plan to do this quite often - dare i say every night - once i have kids who need to be shepherded into bed and into dreamland)

2021-10-20 at 21:09:41: not enough time in the day to be hurt and to make sense of the hurt; to plan and to act in measure; to lay groundwork for the next few days while working to feel whole today

2021-10-19 at 20:03:32: it is important to me that i am part of different spaces in which there are people who inspire me to become better in many ways, through their example and through the ways in which we interact: respectfully, curiously, earnestly, with love and trust that grows deeper with time

2021-10-19 at 19:54:29: @gptbrooke oh wonderful! i’d love to plan a little weekend trip, maybe for november - would love 2 get @profeshkitten in on this too if she so wishes 😊

2021-10-19 at 19:51:57: @Probably_Brian superpowers for sure, no question about it

2021-10-19 at 19:50:48: (i’m recovering just fine and have my mother and partner in town loving on me. with their support i feel cared for and am starting to feel ready to take care of myself)

2021-10-19 at 19:49:52: had a little surgery yesterday. the experience was a little trippy! 

i’m glad that i’m familiar with psychedelics etc now and have thus a greater appreciation for all altered states of consciousness - without that familiarity i think i would have been a bit scared

2021-10-19 at 15:10:07: @temeton_blue is lavender a flavor you enjoy? i thought fo sho i’d like the flavor bc i like the scent, but the flavor does not directly map onto the scent and i found it to be not my favorite

2021-10-19 at 06:48:45: @kehwho all that to say, definitely something there

2021-10-19 at 06:47:58: @kehwho over past year as my mom has gotten deeper into her spirituality, lots more kids just randomly starting to talk to her, even when they’re with their own moms, even when she’s just passing by :’)

2021-10-19 at 05:30:54: @tszzl oh my goodness, a dear friend participated in exactly this. (fortunately it was very helpful for her, though exceedingly meme-able as you’ve demonstrated)

2021-10-17 at 23:20:14: @thinkagainer hahaha the distinction came to mind whilst i was stoned and pondering, seemed wonderfully &amp; serendipitously relevant to your train of thought

2021-10-17 at 23:12:32: maybe eye contact is intense because it’s a high bandwidth communication channel. you lock eyes and suddenly you’ve got more info in- and outflow than you know what to do with

2021-10-17 at 05:04:33: @durdfarm kinda like how hunger/nausea are two sides of the same coin

2021-10-17 at 05:04:08: @durdfarm glad you put this distinction into words! i recently experienced anxiety/excitement as two sides of the same coin

2021-10-17 at 05:02:13: @metaphorician i thought this and the next tweet were a phenomenal description, i like the “nervous system falling behind” framing, makes a lot of sense to me

2021-10-17 at 04:58:34: @WilliamGrobman goodness, sorry to hear about your wife’s diagnosis. sending you two strength

wrt anxiety i also can feel tightness in chest, racing thoughts, negative thoughts about future; i find it interesting you mentioned dizziness!

2021-10-17 at 04:54:42: @moengke_moengke @gptbrooke staticy for sure. what calms the static down for ya?

2021-10-17 at 04:53:36: @soul_journaler wooow yeah loving these sensation descriptions. super interesting that you can place that black hole feeling as originating in your solar plexus

2021-10-17 at 04:51:52: @Centeroak41 wowow what a vivid image, resonance for sure with “energy ascending but restricting and contracting”

2021-10-17 at 03:12:37: this scent reminds me not of home but of somewhere also far away

2021-10-17 at 02:52:11: have you considered that your fear of the future may in reality be a fear of the present: a fear of not doing right by your future self; fear of regret

2021-10-17 at 00:00:46: @tasshinfogleman oh i really like the observation of contracted awareness, rings true for me

fear in stomach is an interesting one - i recently felt a sort of anxious ~fear filling up my chest, which wasn’t actively unpleasant to feel, just buzzy

2021-10-16 at 23:58:16: @taalumot ohhhh this vibes well with the sense i have wrt the intensity of anxiety

been wondering why i get more careless when anxious — the acoustic feedback metaphor, with its waves gets me thinking of constructive/destructive interference

2021-10-16 at 23:38:12: @redcar_tenken hehe no prob, rich!

2021-10-16 at 23:30:26: would you guys mind explaining what anxiety feels like to you, energetically?

2021-10-16 at 23:27:57: observing: for the past few days, there’s been something triggering a cascade of emotional responses within me, whenever i come across it. somehow today even with the same stimuli i am not triggered! 

wonder what’s goin on inside me

2021-10-16 at 21:28:36: @nvpkp her unexpectedly made me feel all sorts of things bc there was resonance w experiences of a long distance relationship...! enjoy your watching session :-)

2021-10-16 at 00:16:58: today i feel like talking out my feelings with an attentive conversation partner with whom i am comfortable &amp; who can reflect and reframe what i’m saying

if it is meant to happen, may it happen! otherwise i will journal &amp; be an attentive audience for myself :-)

2021-10-15 at 23:29:03: @forshaper yeah wow that neatly characterizes both of the motivations i delineated

2021-10-15 at 23:24:09: i think that wanting to be an “original thinker” is in some respect a desire for greatness; under which there can either be the motivation:

(a) to stand out amongst others, for personal glory
(b) for the world to make sense to oneself, to reconcile other’s views w your own https://t.co/8enERYb8OM

2021-10-15 at 03:21:18: how are you guys able to *think* while you’re making eye contact? my brain just stalls

2021-10-15 at 02:26:06: tonight we (i) will be re-reading this transcript, towards 

• reconnecting with the sort of researcher i want to be &amp; 
• understanding how to strive for greatness in ways that don’t drive me mad

https://t.co/GKdDSW8vnx

2021-10-15 at 02:19:57: @moothought not sure if that was your intended meaning, elaborate if you wish 😇

2021-10-15 at 02:19:38: @moothought ooh. what’s coming up for me is something about standing on the shoulders of those who have come before &amp; therefore being able to strive towards greatness

2021-10-15 at 02:17:54: @nickcammarata what also came up for me was idea of leaving a legacy (but why do we want to leave a legacy? our rejection of impermanence?)

2021-10-15 at 02:17:01: @nickcammarata greatness -&gt; better chance of spreading genes?

2021-10-15 at 02:12:32: from where does the desire for greatness spring?

2021-10-14 at 23:59:20: i wonder if my body craves the intensity of anxiety; with a self-induced anxious state, i’m spinning my wheels furiously, and a positive feedback loop begins

2021-10-14 at 22:46:37: breathing deeply, listening to old sufjan while doing lab work is doing something for the anxious state i’ve worked myself into

2021-10-14 at 05:43:02: @kehwho i saw him! it was amazing :’)

2021-10-13 at 20:16:16: thought i was floundering but turns out i’ve been synthesizing and learning a lot

2021-10-13 at 16:50:56: 4. breakfast this morning; experimenting with a little more fat and protein in this meal relative to my baseline oatmeal breakfast. happy with how this plate came together ☺️ https://t.co/e3jXLgW6zx

2021-10-13 at 16:38:20: @forshaper ohhh this is reminding me of a thing i listened to about meditation with the so-ham mantra - as you repeat it and sink into concentration, you ideally ultimately *experience* its meaning (identifying yourself with the universe)

2021-10-13 at 16:35:24: an interesting thing about hinduism is its degree of “customizability” for each spiritual aspirant, often taking into account astrological information to assess a person’s karmic load and to prescribe specific practices

2021-10-13 at 16:31:14: people who know things about mantras in a hindu/tantric context: the mantras i’ve worked with have generally had a protective/remedial purpose

is that generally what mantras are for? are there other modes of action?

2021-10-13 at 16:28:39: on wednesdays we listen to vishnu sahasranamam

2021-10-13 at 03:05:56: three more new friends made whilst waiting for the bus! they’re in a related department &amp; we had lots to chat about :-)

2021-10-13 at 02:42:26: unexpectedly excellent evening of focused work on a problem set, then running into a cohort mate &amp; bonding over common research interests :)

2021-10-13 at 02:40:10: i’m developing a sneaking suspicion that day-to-day synthetic biology research involves quite a bit of wet lab work

2021-10-13 at 01:09:21: @_StevenFan :O wow okay now i feel authorized to see value in &amp; show up with stream of consciousness free-writes!

2021-10-13 at 01:08:09: @valor_zhang @_StevenFan i like this, thank you for sharing! helpful to have a template

2021-10-13 at 01:07:00: @Tjdriii (i don’t mean to read too far into a perhaps lighthearted tweet, just curious!)

2021-10-13 at 01:06:22: @Tjdriii to an outside observer, you seem like a person who generally tries their best &amp; puts in honest efforts...! would be curious in what way(s) you feel like you could try even harder

2021-10-12 at 19:40:05: @VividVoid_ awh you put me exactly where i thought i’d be! ♥️

2021-10-12 at 18:22:11: @_StevenFan the problem i tend to have: i delay seeking support - ultimately usually don’t - because i “don’t yet have a clear enough vision”, “need more to show”, “don’t deserve their time yet”... 

any advice on getting comfy asking for support early on?

2021-10-12 at 18:21:20: @_StevenFan i like the distinction you made between collaborators / support, it confirmed some of my thinking

2021-10-12 at 18:00:42: @_StevenFan ooh! could you elaborate on what adding support might look like?

2021-10-12 at 17:59:47: i want all the nuance and detail you’re willing to share!

2021-10-12 at 17:59:05: in your experience, does adding a collaborator(s) to a project you’ve started generally increase chances of completion/success?

2021-10-12 at 17:06:51: @empathy2000 what’s the relationship between exercise and sleep in your day to day life? (curious because you’re more into fitness)

2021-10-12 at 17:06:04: @empathy2000 makes sense! thank you :)

2021-10-12 at 16:11:20: strange empirical finding: yesterday i prioritized eating well, i physically exerted myself a little above baseline; and this past night it seems i needed less sleep than in recent weeks

⬆️ food, = exercise, ⬇️ sleep needed would make sense to me

⬆️ food, ⬆️ exercise, ⬇️ sleep?

2021-10-12 at 02:31:20: for the first time in recent memory i feel a fondness for the early darkness; i left campus when the sky was at once yellow and blue; and the darkness has set in now once i’ve reached my neighborhood and so it feels like i have entered my cocoon

2021-10-11 at 21:03:12: man i’d love to take a thermodynamics course if i weren’t so scared of the math

2021-10-11 at 15:06:40: @VividVoid_ :-)

2021-10-11 at 02:25:25: @startingfromnix 🥰

2021-10-11 at 02:13:55: 3. dinner tonight; i was going to throw away sweet potato skin from lunch but housemate informed me of its nutritional value so i fried it in coconut oil with mushrooms &amp; a little worcestershire sauce and they tasted amazing https://t.co/1lrvhgBZAr

2021-10-11 at 02:09:52: 2. lunch with friends who came to visit today; such a joy to be able to give and share nourishing food; used basil another friend had given me yesterday https://t.co/t51kHfjC6t

2021-10-11 at 02:04:50: 1. first time cooking with new housemate, a few nights ago; farmers market produce, colorful plate, grateful for insistence on protein https://t.co/z6mB2saMGR

2021-10-11 at 02:00:58: starting a thread of meals that make me happy - joyous, satisfied, proud, warm, incandescent in my chest 🥘💗 https://t.co/8kaRpbc3jZ

2021-10-10 at 22:25:50: feelin happy and light :)

2021-10-10 at 18:03:58: poetry and prose have unique ways of showcasing the little details

in poetry, details shine as you read the poem row by row; in prose details glint because in the wheat field of words that were written, the writer chose to draw attention to that small sensory thing

2021-10-10 at 17:39:25: @embryosophy simultaneously groaning and feeling special bc i got this one

2021-10-10 at 17:32:26: @embryosophy duuuuude

2021-10-10 at 05:05:13: @DarbraDawn @HanjoYoutaku hellooo! you find anything you like?

2021-10-09 at 23:57:19: @smallkewlhuman what! i was expecting 100% yes hahaha

2021-10-09 at 22:29:48: it feels like my surroundings are generating themselves with each step

2021-10-09 at 22:20:22: all packed up ready for a little wander in the afternoon sunlight 🍂🌿☀️

2021-10-09 at 21:42:56: under all of these protective mechanisms i am beginning to find the soft center, the one who is being protected, the little princess locked away

2021-10-09 at 20:32:26: this afternoon i intend to dissolve the distance between my present self and my future self who is deserving of love only after she does what she is supposed to

2021-10-09 at 20:28:48: have no fear, we draw near

https://t.co/b9gujMT6f3

2021-10-09 at 20:25:28: i want to read poetry about womanhood, please share below if anything springs to mind

2021-10-09 at 19:52:40: trying to decide how i want to dissolve today

2021-10-09 at 17:45:00: @kehwho oh dis is so nice

2021-10-09 at 00:55:48: just bought a smol guitar! last time i tried to learn, the guitar i had was way too big for me. may the learning be easeful &amp; engaging, and may this allow me to finally start writing more songs :’)

2021-10-09 at 00:24:01: perusing spotify to see which episode of on being with krista tippett i will be profoundly moved by on my drive into the city this evening

2021-10-08 at 23:43:06: @quotidiania oh my goodness. how did she react?

2021-10-08 at 19:17:07: you know how some people jiggle their leg while thinking or sitting? are you one of those people?

2021-10-08 at 19:15:00: feeling like a little black squirrel

2021-10-08 at 19:07:10: voice is breath turned outward into sound

2021-10-08 at 19:03:49: character virtues versus contextual virtues

2021-10-08 at 02:57:07: @joespurpleshirt mom told me that there’s a specific type of prayer mat you can sit on when ya do your daily prayers that is quite good for dealing with your accumulated karmas

2021-10-08 at 02:35:49: u know how sometimes when you look at street lamps they have a rainbow halo around them? i wanna glow like that. u look my way and have to take a double take. is there a for real halo around me? yeah dude

2021-10-08 at 02:33:22: oh to be unafraid

2021-10-08 at 01:04:34: i think i’ve been operating with the perhaps fallacious belief that with adequate planning, i won’t experience suffering. but the planning is never adequate!

2021-10-08 at 00:28:10: figuring out how to eat well is a thing that feels critically important for me at this moment

2021-10-07 at 21:51:44: @_StevenFan want to respond to this, leaving this as a bookmark for me later today

2021-10-07 at 20:29:14: @choosy_mom ♥️♥️♥️ you’re going to have such a wonderful time!

2021-10-07 at 20:17:31: @yokaihainen awh yeah! i will eagerly await any photos you might take on this walk

2021-10-07 at 20:16:21: @KasraKaley @EyalShay2 sounds dope, would you mind explaining what a dialectic session is?

2021-10-07 at 20:07:19: @HanjoYoutaku 😍

2021-10-07 at 20:06:15: @HanjoYoutaku oooh very nice, is it a particular kind of massage?

2021-10-07 at 20:03:20: oh! it’s thursday, we’re allowed to start getting excited for the weekend. you have anything you’re looking forward to?

2021-10-07 at 00:32:44: @taalumot @hormeze my parents have written in their wills that they each want to be cremated &amp; have their ashes scattered in a body of water

how do you feel about the idea of visiting the place where their ashes would be scattered?

2021-10-06 at 00:33:44: most of me ~enjoys my day-to-day, there is a small (but growing) part of me that wants to be in some beautiful nature (preferably with mountains &amp;/or meadows) no less than an 8 mile hike in, in the midst of a moderate dose psychedelic trip

2021-10-06 at 00:28:00: life has gotten quite busy recently after maybe a year of comparative less-busy-ness, and i am still adjusting. i’m hopeful the adjustment period will be over soon

2021-10-05 at 22:10:56: the tactile/embodied element of each of those tasks really seems to do something for me

2021-10-05 at 22:09:38: there are some things i do that typically put me into a good mood without conscious effort on my part, eg (1) driving (when not rush hour/stressful), (2) wet lab work

2021-10-05 at 19:02:21: @alexeyguzey !!!!! so happy for you!

2021-10-05 at 06:14:13: had some triphala tea 1h ago, my doshas are gonna be super balanced tomorrow 🤘

2021-10-05 at 06:13:02: am learning the right amount to plan for the day ahead: if i load my future self’s plate too heavily, i don’t wanna get up in the morning! 

but if i get it right (which is the goal), the next day i’m focused, excited, generating momentum...!

2021-10-05 at 02:09:10: decided to attend class this evening and i am so glad i did! towards the end we had a little small group bonding thing and i discovered that everyone is cool &amp; mature &amp; passionate &amp; has a vision &amp; a history

2021-10-04 at 23:50:33: extending a humble apology to the various roommates i lived with before i knew how to be a good roommate

2021-10-04 at 19:26:17: t minus 10 minutes til the last back &amp; forth trip of the move, this time with cat in tow!

2021-10-04 at 09:23:56: @ctbeiser clever!

2021-10-04 at 09:11:03: @gracemercur 👀 https://t.co/8rkTwOMYtA

2021-10-04 at 08:50:51: given the hypothetical opportunity: would you replace some or all normal lilies (very toxic to cats) with genetically engineered lilies that aren’t toxic to cats?

2021-10-04 at 07:36:05: i had a magical moment in class last week where i was presenting part of a paper we were discussing

prof had posed an open ended q i wasn’t sure about

i started talking, not completely sure of myself, became increasingly sure. and when i finished, prof goes: “exactly!”

2021-10-04 at 06:03:12: shocked to learn that scorpio is the sign directly before sagittarius! thought there was more time-distance separating the two!

2021-10-04 at 05:57:14: (2) logistical brain has been trying to figure out when the last day of my move should be (when i move my cat over)

i thought i’d decide later tonight; started sobbing on drive back to house i’m leaving bc heart knew this was the last time i’d be coming to this place as home

2021-10-04 at 05:55:15: (1) “inexplicable” sadness &amp; sobbing days before i realized i needed to break up with ex-bf

then i took 3 days to write up a 3 page analysis of the relationship &amp; conclude, analytically, what my heart had already told me

2021-10-04 at 05:55:15: every so often my emotions tell me what’s happening before my intellectual/analytical mind has decided, e.g.

2021-10-04 at 05:43:59: what a minefield novel intimacy in a relationship can be!

2021-10-04 at 05:41:17: the pursuit of new experiences, whether or not you realize it, is the pursuit of deeper and deeper empathy

2021-10-04 at 05:23:21: https://t.co/loZE9DjDwc

2021-10-04 at 01:25:35: feeling nostalgic for suburban childhood

2021-10-03 at 23:57:22: what da heck!!!

2021-10-03 at 23:57:12: i’m moving and in the process various anxieties are popping up

somehow i’m having this repeated experience of feeling a little bit of discomfort - holding it in me, trying not to give into a spiral

&amp; then things end up working out / i get divinely guided to an easeful solution

2021-10-03 at 21:48:32: RT @Grimezsz: Art is the skeleton consciousness leaves behind after you die

2021-10-03 at 21:26:43: you have to know how to express things with levity before you can express things with proper gravity

2021-10-03 at 19:58:18: @Lan_Dao_ @Tjdriii @AskYatharth let it be known that yatharth was wearing ROLLER SKATES

2021-10-03 at 19:57:41: in a shocking twist of fate, i will now be the person in my relationship without a bed frame

2021-10-03 at 18:15:25: i’m really enjoying discovering east bay neighborhoods! yesterday driving down from el cerrito through kensington, today piedmont. the views are lovely, the houses fun, and the driving easier than in sf :)

2021-10-03 at 17:05:27: i will miss mornings in this house https://t.co/mZN5iDGgGX

2021-10-02 at 20:36:01: @sonnenmimi @VividVoid_ oh my goodness! same!

2021-10-02 at 20:34:00: @VividVoid_ the phrasing “dredging a channel in your heart” has stuck with me ever since i read it, and in some moments i can feel it in my chest https://t.co/MWuPRNtqrI

2021-10-02 at 20:33:02: @VividVoid_ this thread ♥️ https://t.co/iHAjjkJIIU

2021-10-02 at 18:46:35: gonna go for “desert in the evening light” vibes in this new space i’m moving into 🏜🌇🌀🌵

2021-10-02 at 18:42:47: recognizing that since childhood patience has been something i’ve found hard. patience requires trust

2021-10-02 at 17:32:07: @taalumot 😭 so sweeeet

2021-10-02 at 17:21:49: @BLUNDERBUSSTED looks amazing! enjoy 😻

2021-10-02 at 16:48:57: ahaha i took a fat L and missed the intended plans to finish a problem set. my friday evening was thus filled with frustration and - i hate to admit this lol - tears

on da plus side i got to see friends after &amp; introduced some people to each other and they really hit it off!

2021-10-02 at 16:16:45: @visakanv this one comes to mind bc it struck a chord in me &amp; catalyzed some internal shifting

2021-10-02 at 15:19:34: @eggprophet gm bear

2021-10-02 at 07:14:23: @ashleydzhang @VividVoid_ not to say it’s impossible or not worthwhile!

2021-10-02 at 07:14:00: @ashleydzhang @VividVoid_ ime marriage/family is hard to plan for in the abstract, having a partner makes things easier because you have a more concrete sense of how your temperaments will intertwine towards a shared future :)

2021-10-02 at 06:43:25: basking in the social warmth, feeling warm in my chest and happy to have committed to spending my twenties with these people

2021-10-02 at 06:42:05: as i’m starting to connect to &amp; live out my own vision of being a scientist / phd student, i’m empathizing with and seeing with higher resolution my phd student friends who are a little further along

2021-10-02 at 06:37:12: last time i felt strongly about having a best friend was 6th grade. happy to feel bf is my best friend now :’)

2021-10-02 at 04:26:14: hey @myceliummage look at this mug https://t.co/IEU6q2hSd1

2021-10-02 at 00:19:17: @sashintweets nope!

2021-10-01 at 23:22:30: wondering what the smallest scale at which agency exists is — bacteria have been shown to have agency, swimming against a concentration gradient; 
atoms are perhaps governed solely by physics &amp; thus they simply do what they are told?

2021-10-01 at 23:17:32: starting to feel real again in your collective presence

2021-10-01 at 23:06:49: @HanjoYoutaku + this https://t.co/9AjQ9nVDTP

2021-10-01 at 23:06:08: @HanjoYoutaku this tweet of tasshin’s led to a shift in my view / way of living https://t.co/Xo5W2XkZbu

2021-10-01 at 23:04:36: @HanjoYoutaku yes i’ve over time converged to viewing them as convergent ideas too :)

2021-10-01 at 23:03:17: this week there was a problem set that was the bane of my intellectual existence

gonna delineate cal newport’s strategy for tackling a pset in the thread below, 
and as i go through next week’s pset mark &amp; comment as i go through each step

🧮🧲✍🏽•••

2021-10-01 at 22:47:30: working towards forming a personal relationship with god helps me feel less alone

2021-10-01 at 22:47:03: there was a tame impala concert recently where i felt my sadness and fear and i felt like nothing more than a bag of organs. but then there was a moment of clarity, a clear internal transition, where i realized that i must work towards bearing my burdens with grace

2021-10-01 at 22:44:00: i’m coming to terms with the realities of my body after a few years spent in denial

2021-10-01 at 22:39:34: @irafeierabend sam probs saw the number and was like uhhh if it’s important they’ll leave a voicemail 🤣

2021-10-01 at 22:36:59: @ThanksThoth bahahaha

2021-10-01 at 22:36:43: @relic_radiation it was more of a distillation of thought than an acute expression of pain or suffering, but regardless i so appreciate the love and i will happily receive it 💗☺️

2021-10-01 at 22:33:05: health is a fascinating thing to navigate when you were exposed to sickness early in life (either yourself or someone close to you)

from an early age, the vitality of your body is something you, in theory, don’t take for granted

2021-10-01 at 22:30:23: when i was a kid i would go on about how religion is a structured way to move your locus of control from internal to external, and i thought i was very smart for this

2021-10-01 at 22:27:43: the instinct to choose words carefully is a good one. i’m grateful for the scalable complexity of language

2021-10-01 at 22:21:19: makes it harder to vibe

2021-10-01 at 22:20:31: i wish that conventional christianity didn’t require rejection of other faiths

2021-10-01 at 22:17:14: ideological tensions i have had the joy and agony of carrying in my being. some specific, some general:

• science / engineering
• san francisco / los angeles
• science / spirituality
• acceptance / hope

2021-10-01 at 22:10:06: simple maxims for complex systems

2021-10-01 at 22:07:21: man you just have to believe that things are going to get better

2021-10-01 at 21:58:18: dear one, can’t you see that this is an exercise in non-attachment?

2021-10-01 at 21:56:53: i could see it going either or both ways! 

i think my acute “overwhelm” feeling will be helped by being around friends, but practically this means i have less time to move &amp; less time to be by myself/decompress

2021-10-01 at 21:55:30: i agreed to social plans this evening but frankly i am feeling overwhelmed (in the present moment bc of work; i’m also moving this wknd)

it will be interesting to observe how i feel tonight, because there is a part of me that is wondering “did i make the right choice?”

2021-10-01 at 11:23:27: well shite, cat has figured out we’re moving and he’s giving me those big sad eyes

2021-10-01 at 09:43:09: remember when god calls to samuel not once but three times, and samuel doesn’t know yet that he’s hearing the voice of god?

2021-10-01 at 02:13:58: @_StevenFan @AskYatharth @wholebodyprayer @joespurpleshirt @buddingbirch love love love! thank you steven, hello sweet twitter housemates! 🥰

2021-10-01 at 01:34:53: i love showing up enthusiastically when my friends put in the effort to organize a collective activity 🥰

2021-09-30 at 21:36:49: solid work/life boundaries are great; 

willful lack of boundaries bc you’re wholly mind-and-spirit into what you’re doing, also great; 

it’s the territory in the middle that’s not so great

2021-09-30 at 21:30:29: @_StevenFan please!

2021-09-30 at 21:16:11: staying true to my temporally distinct selves, creating coherence, resonance, harmonics

2021-09-30 at 19:57:26: @michaelcurzi i’d describe myself as striking a nice balance between [warm, feminine, space-holding, soft] &amp; [inquisitive/analytical]

2021-09-30 at 19:55:35: @michaelcurzi something is telling me i’d be good at this, would be happy to discuss further if you feel any vibe resonance :-)

2021-09-30 at 19:47:16: @Virtual1nstinct do u remember the episode where he tried to get over his fear of women by dating 10 at the same time

2021-09-30 at 19:23:32: eighty degrees in sf? dope, looks like i’ll be working through my problem set outside 😎

2021-09-30 at 08:13:02: when i wake up, may my desire for understanding temper my fears

2021-09-29 at 23:02:01: what does your body feel like when you give a sincere apology?

2021-09-29 at 05:07:07: let me strive for greatness in peace!

2021-09-28 at 18:27:30: @smallkewlhuman here you are :) https://t.co/1lxKoYWb5E

2021-09-28 at 02:10:52: @smallkewlhuman i’m glad you asked this, bc it led me to reflect a bit more on the disparate ideas i have on this. i don’t have specific findings, just a nascent intellectual/embodied idea scaffold (can post some handwritten notes if interested)

2021-09-28 at 00:29:17: @taalumot love it &lt;3

2021-09-28 at 00:12:37: @taalumot also curious!

2021-09-27 at 22:05:04: @hormeze @tasshinfogleman @embryosophy @chakathemighty @m_ashcroft @this_is_silvia 😂💯

2021-09-27 at 19:03:11: acid indicated to me that thinking could be fun and siddhartha by herman hesse showed me thinking could be virtuous

2021-09-27 at 18:43:50: it seems that in school we are expected to do quite a bit of thinking but we are rarely taught or shown that thinking can be enjoyable

2021-09-27 at 01:16:09: @tasshinfogleman i’d love an assignment...!

2021-09-24 at 21:54:27: reunited with bf and the mountains here, he is cuter than ever and they are grander than ever 🥰⛰

2021-09-24 at 00:38:57: @Lan_Dao_ oh lol lan just stay at my place

2021-09-23 at 22:52:20: @xaelophone related: https://t.co/AclFHDuKGt

2021-09-23 at 22:51:05: @xaelophone generally, making yourself &amp; your way of being legible authorizes other people to lean into their own way of being

2021-09-23 at 22:50:55: @xaelophone other people’s legibility has guided my self-narrative professionally and also personally, e.g. how to handle health or interpersonal challenges

2021-09-23 at 22:49:55: @xaelophone 🔥🔥🔥 this thread articulates an idea i’ve been grasping at recently

2021-09-23 at 21:13:28: have been playing around with frame of physical body as inherently divine

2021-09-23 at 20:51:28: @Mousr8 (at some point, i’d love to talk more &amp; hear about your fertility journey, perhaps over dms or a call. anticipating a non linear fertility journey myself)

2021-09-23 at 20:46:34: @Mousr8 ♥️♥️♥️

2021-09-23 at 20:38:59: @Mousr8 what wonderful news, so happy for you and prerat. the next several months are going to be such an exciting and special time, preparing to welcome your little one into the world ♥️

2021-09-23 at 20:20:23: @Prigoose we’ve been dreaming of going for a while now, i am so excited to finally go! i’ve only ever seen catalina amidst the clouds, on hikes in LA when you look towards the ocean

2021-09-23 at 20:06:44: mri results are back, current health challenge isn’t over but it is not as bad as it could be - i don’t have to cancel my weekend plans! catalina here we come ☺️

2021-09-23 at 19:47:38: @empathy2000 ah! haha

was curious bc i’m currently taking 5000 iu/day as per doctor’s suggestion, and apparently even w that much it takes 3 months to go from insufficient levels to solidly healthy levels

2021-09-23 at 19:09:01: @empathy2000 how does one train their body to absorb more vitamin D 🧐

2021-09-23 at 06:18:10: @HanjoYoutaku i did actually quite enjoy myself! i found the experience oddly relaxing; some of the machine sounds felt like bass through a loud speaker

2021-09-23 at 06:15:38: @VividVoid_ https://t.co/h1bCIXnXrd

2021-09-22 at 21:03:15: getting my first mri in ~10 years done this afternoon 🧲

2021-09-21 at 19:27:47: @reconfigurthing heck yeah! good on you for being proactive :)

2021-09-21 at 19:12:12: good lord, my body feels so stressed

2021-09-20 at 04:59:49: when i mentioned this thought to my partner earlier today, he said: by bringing the text to life, you, in turn, achieve a sort of immortality

2021-09-20 at 04:57:51: i really like in christianity how there is an explicit directive to become intimately acquainted with scripture;

to literally bring the text to life by contemplating it &amp; living your life by its resonant words

2021-09-20 at 00:55:20: @Witchuals @VividVoid_ ohh i love that you brought up heart space &amp; long energy cycles!

2021-09-20 at 00:52:36: @VividVoid_ strong intuition (a willingness to listen &amp; honor intuition, and to guide other with it); a drive towards self-knowledge (against helplessness)

2021-09-20 at 00:50:10: @VividVoid_ nurturing, holding space, identification with spectrum of female archetypes (mother, sister, daughter, mystic, healer...)

access to ways of showing/giving love; strong-hearted (often thanks to spirituality of some sort)

2021-09-19 at 17:34:31: provided all remains well with my health, i get to see bf this friday and go on a little socal adventure!

2021-09-19 at 05:50:23: the bay is really starting to feel like home 🥺

2021-09-19 at 05:45:18: had a nice time!

got to see a few people i hadn’t seen in some time, bask in the presence of a 3 month old baby, &amp; got to see a twitter friend in oakland... 

and now on track to be home just before 11! woohoo!

2021-09-19 at 03:46:18: crochet is crazy isn’t it? all you can do with just one hook?

2021-09-19 at 00:00:57: sometimes i feel that i am seeing the world through particularly clear eyes, and when i make eye contact using those clear eyes i feel particularly connected to my fellow humans

2021-09-18 at 23:55:16: @altashtree i would be happy to elaborate but i’m not sure what direction to go in

2021-09-18 at 23:51:35: @altashtree i had a very pleasant experience microdosing recently - first time i had a nice time on a microdose

felt a mild/medium stimulant effect (more energy in my body) + mood-boosting + increased empathy

2021-09-18 at 23:33:58: ok! packing up to head over now

2021-09-18 at 22:48:19: @valor_zhang hehe i was just curious if you had arrived at any conclusions! i’ve been experiencing more “who am i” moments in the past few weeks/months/year, which were at first a bit unpleasant but now i realize there’s something lovely &amp; liberating about them

2021-09-18 at 22:42:49: @valor_zhang what is identity then 😇🤸‍♀️

2021-09-18 at 22:28:57: do i

2021-09-18 at 20:01:49: @smallkewlhuman right?! they seem like some sort of mutant sunflowers

2021-09-18 at 20:01:19: despite its aches, pains, tantrums, and burdens, what a privilege it is to occupy this body

2021-09-18 at 02:53:13: mind-blowing blooms https://t.co/MXDlo8gwvm

2021-09-17 at 18:58:42: brain has reached saturation point with new immunology info today! life is grand

2021-09-17 at 18:55:09: @nickcammarata @Lan_Dao_ omg i’m probs moving to berkeley soon too!!!

2021-09-17 at 03:08:41: + layer of aesthetic meaning https://t.co/ZnpVMj4ZyC

2021-09-17 at 02:01:04: thrift store book haul :) https://t.co/Jy1qwByqH0

2021-09-17 at 00:54:49: @jonathandubin awh! sending a hug

also wanted to say i’m happy to chat over the phone sometime if you want to talk anything out - i had a lovely time talking with you that one time in your/our/my backyard :)

2021-09-16 at 21:49:40: @rhymeswithvocal ♥️♥️♥️ i’ve been musing and reading about love today too. this is a lovely thought

2021-09-16 at 21:46:33: @ellenour17 how goes becoming acquainted with the limits of your thinking? sending strength and insight 🌸

2021-09-16 at 20:47:56: you show your commitment to the future by showing up in the present

2021-09-16 at 20:11:34: we crave validation that the way we are acting is Right when we lose touch with our own sense of what’s Right

2021-09-16 at 19:23:45: don’t mind me just eating my oatmeal reading about jesus’s love

2021-09-15 at 20:44:48: destabilizing when you lose connection with your sense of what is Right. untethered

2021-09-14 at 23:34:35: @smallkewlhuman naw i’ve been feeling similarly on timescale of past few weeks/months but haven’t figured out how i want to work with it. i’d be interested in seeing how u do it hehe

2021-09-14 at 20:20:51: well, 3 months later i find myself feeling weak and far away from health. the journey begins again

2021-09-14 at 20:09:11: as we become more intuitive we become healthier ⚕️

2021-09-14 at 20:00:40: there’s something that appeals to me about the sacrificial nature of giving up drinking [for some period of time]. offering up any suffering to a [christian] divine power, towards some sort of repentance or purification

2021-09-14 at 19:58:15: but i still cling on to alcohol because of (1) the one case in which i like it, (2) social friction i imagine i’ll cause by not drinking, (3) fear of having to handle more social anxiety w/o alc

2021-09-14 at 19:55:33: frankly alcohol even feels unpleasant the night of!

2021-09-14 at 19:54:24: might try on being a non-drinker. these days the only way i enjoy alcohol is with 1-2 beers, where there’s this unmistakable release of tension somewhere inside me

otherwise i don’t like how my temperament morphs under its influence; memory loss; feeling like shite the next day

2021-09-14 at 19:38:12: what happens when you sit with your physical pain?

2021-09-14 at 04:16:32: @disconcerta sometimes i do! sometimes i don’t!

2021-09-14 at 01:28:20: symptoms: nihilism &amp; a headache

2021-09-14 at 01:23:25: noticing caffeine come-down is particularly jarring cognitively &amp; mildly unpleasant physically for me

particularly true on days when i’m already sleep deprived, tba if true when well-rested

2021-09-14 at 00:39:22: moving in union with my body, a wave of sadness rises and shakes me with its tenor

2021-09-14 at 00:33:58: growing pains • learning to call upon my parents for the support i need, and learning how to handle &amp; see to the core of the ways they react that trigger me

2021-09-13 at 21:49:54: over the past few years i’ve felt my heart crack again and again

with the rushing sentiment - if only my younger self knew how good life could be - 

incrementally liberating myself from my in significant part parentally induced patterns and fears

2021-09-13 at 21:46:46: i think i can enjoy the wet lab work - work with my hands - when my heart &amp; mind are into it

2021-09-13 at 21:44:33: i know youth can be painful and awkward, but i hope i can use my influence to make my brother’s remaining youth generally lovely as well

2021-09-13 at 21:18:44: when you make plans and in the process are thoughtful towards your body, your body listens

2021-09-13 at 20:38:08: @prerationalist great point! yes i definitely could try this

simultaneously, i also find *something* constraining about the nature of writing on here...

i guess i crave a wide open expanse to write or an experience that is a little different (the word “weaving” is coming to mind)

2021-09-13 at 20:29:07: as you become more mindful in everyday moments, you reclaim time for contemplation

2021-09-13 at 20:29:07: time for contemplation is essential for the reflective person

2021-09-13 at 18:56:01: the sublime joy of committing to a single book (or two) https://t.co/CRFgmyeFCK

2021-09-13 at 18:54:58: the more in tune i am with myself, the fewer books i carry with me to any outing or event

2021-09-13 at 18:50:59: tying my hair up real high to receive the warmth of the sun on the nape of my neck

2021-09-13 at 17:39:43: ⚡️ https://t.co/xzmDI8kAmR

2021-09-13 at 06:56:25: i will be married in just a few years :)

2021-09-13 at 06:55:39: wanna wear a toe ring but as per indian culture i can’t wear until i’m married !

2021-09-13 at 03:20:43: you are labyrinthine, my love

2021-09-13 at 03:17:26: laughing super hard after eating a mouthful of raisins so the laughter tastes sweet

2021-09-13 at 03:10:40: heart melting thinking of future self setting example of nightly hindu and beyond prayers for young children

2021-09-13 at 02:11:58: https://t.co/4aq4k3hT75

2021-09-13 at 02:10:53: feeling wonderfully ~•~integrated~•~ today

2021-09-13 at 02:09:25: @IlanaPilato @jacasiegel i remember experiencing this deeply as a child finishing a beloved fiction book!

2021-09-13 at 01:28:26: @nvpkp naw i appreciate this view, i’ll definitely sit with it. resonant for sure

2021-09-13 at 01:27:30: @nvpkp oh there’s also another project that would involve some introspecting &amp; interviewing! but i am feeling less called to that one lately 😞

2021-09-13 at 01:21:01: i am but a fly, caught in the milk and honey sunlight https://t.co/1vrpJMvRcb

2021-09-13 at 01:05:22: @nvpkp i guess to reframe my question: do you experience a difference in the mindset where twitter feels good versus when writing long form feels good?

2021-09-13 at 01:03:26: @nvpkp even just mentioning short story is lighting flame inside me! i could see a burst of inspiration in my future :)

2021-09-13 at 00:54:15: “know who you are” - be in tune with your needs &amp; wants. know where you really are right now.

2021-09-13 at 00:53:41: @nvpkp short story (have barebones), one science writing project which will require a bit of research, &amp; also generally expound upon some thoughts towards creating a zettelkasten corpus

2021-09-13 at 00:50:56: that first part is the hard one. aspirations are easy but to feel held as you are, you must know who you are &amp; you have to build trust with those who are to hold you

2021-09-13 at 00:49:37: i want to create spaces where people feel both that they are held as they are &amp; that they are supported in their aspirations

2021-09-13 at 00:38:29: also asking @visakanv if you have any relevant thoughts! perhaps even already written in a thread or similar :)

2021-09-13 at 00:07:27: how do you do it (shift headspace from twitterbrain to long form writing) @nvpkp @tasshinfogleman @nickcammarata &amp; any other friends with thoughts

2021-09-13 at 00:04:08: no wonder my twitter squirrel brain has trouble being patient &amp; allowing long form writing to take shape

2021-09-13 at 00:00:20: and just like that, i have allowed myself to become dear to you!

2021-09-12 at 23:57:42: @cheema_shubh oh that sounds wonderful, thank you for your illustrative words :)

i’ve been interested in shifting my schedule earlier! cool to hear you find it magical. i know kundalini yoga practice is typically supposed to be done quite early... if that’s something you’re familiar with?

2021-09-12 at 23:55:14: @Coscorrodrift thank you for bringing limerence into my vocabulary! what a fun thing to ponder. have you experienced limerence - and when?

there’s this relevant yves tumor song

https://t.co/ZjV9FyEaPB

2021-09-12 at 23:53:24: @Coscorrodrift ah schedulifying! worth a try for sure. i’m in the process of adding a notion life management system to my weeks. you know how you’d implement the scheduling? &amp; what is making you feel the need for scheduling?

2021-09-12 at 23:52:03: @Coscorrodrift just occupying this generative headspace where i’ve been able to fluidly think about relationships, emotions, work, psychedelia, spirituality (practices, values i want to uphold). feeling whole

2021-09-12 at 23:49:49: @Coscorrodrift ooh lemme try and answer. i don’t have a clear answer to *what* i’ve been vibing *about*

i just know that the tweets have been flowing, which is coming from a state of internal clarity and peace that’s been around for the past ~2 days

2021-09-12 at 23:43:06: when you show me that you need me, if i am humble enough i can recognize this, and then i am free to love you

2021-09-12 at 23:36:56: @ctbeiser i don’t fully understand what this means but it is a very cb tweet and for that i enjoyed it

2021-09-12 at 23:35:02: @tasshinfogleman @samvega_pasada okay very vibe-y and not rooted in theory, but my experiences with yoga asanas have tended to be more earthy &amp; grounding (perhaps with a side of fire)

whereas my dabbling into tai chi has been way more evocative of water

2021-09-12 at 23:32:54: @samvega_pasada what kinda textbooks you lookin for?

2021-09-12 at 23:32:00: relationships are such a wonderful container in which to witness the other’s idiosyncrasies &amp; empower the other to lean into their eccentricities 🤍

2021-09-12 at 23:28:44: @HanjoYoutaku thank you for seeing me!

2021-09-12 at 23:28:18: above tweet is an invitation for all followers, new and long-time

2021-09-12 at 23:26:23: @HanjoYoutaku ♥️♥️♥️

2021-09-12 at 23:25:42: influx of new followers after you’ve been vibing hard is a very nice feeling. welcome! excited to enrich one another’s lives :)

if you feel like it, share something that’s been on your mind &amp; perhaps we can converse about it in the replies ♥️

2021-09-12 at 22:13:39: @Virtual1nstinct have been loving &amp; leaning into lakshmi for past year or so

2021-09-12 at 22:05:23: @tasshinfogleman aw thank you for believing in me :) i’d of course be curious about your recs!

2021-09-12 at 22:03:58: @forshaper you know, i think i’ll give it a try. i even already have a copy!

flipping through it, i’m struck by the sense that this book is an articulation of the sort of greatness i hope to embody. it’s simultaneously intimidating and exciting.

2021-09-12 at 21:51:04: (1) mind creating reality where you’re drowning • (2) coming up for air, taking in deep lungfuls • (3) remembering there is a journey to undertake towards discovering your true nature

2021-09-12 at 21:48:18: nothing like coming out of a period of anxious ideation to reawaken your thirst for unfettered, ultimate reality

2021-09-12 at 21:29:42: he does however demonstrate tremendous creativity in his writing form, which i want to explore 😭

2021-09-12 at 21:22:49: i’m gonna be honest, i don’t think i’m intellectually ready for hofstadter

2021-09-12 at 21:11:40: @sashachapin and long morning walks!

2021-09-12 at 20:39:00: having written all this out, i now feel that i am allowed to listen to my instincts

2021-09-12 at 20:36:42: so why the internal distaste for last-minute type profs?

there were two profs i worked with in undergrad who were like this, which seems to have left a mark on me

last-minute prof means to me: often over-promising; your stress around deadlines becomes my stress

2021-09-12 at 20:36:41: it’s also evident to me that unless i put conscious effort in, i may remain a last-minute person - it’s not a given that i will grow wiser and more mature and less last-minute

2021-09-12 at 20:36:41: seeing that my dad works the way he does makes it evident to me that i have two options: 

(1) continue being a last-minute person and find ways to mitigate resulting anxiety; 

or (2) address the underlying anxiety and become more proactive, less last-minute

2021-09-12 at 20:36:41: my mom and my dad have extremely different working styles in the same profession, where mom is a master of discipline &amp; dad tends to work in sprints near deadlines

i think these working habits are reflective of their respective emotional natures

2021-09-12 at 20:36:41: i have a tendency to leave things to the last minute, but it’s a pattern i’m working on. there’s definitely an adrenaline rush &amp; a glorious release but the associated anxiety is generally not worth it

2021-09-12 at 20:36:40: in identifying which labs i want to try working in for phd, noticing i’m avoiding professors who show a tendency for leaving things to the last minute

even if the work is cool!

mixed feelings about this:

2021-09-12 at 04:33:51: turns out that once i have the “why” of something my mom wants me to do, it’s way more likely i’ll do it. however she is more forthcoming with emotional pressure than explanations 😅👩‍👧♥️

2021-09-12 at 04:31:16: soon the time will arrive to downsize my bookshelf and keep only the books that reflect my essence. perhaps that will coincide with a book thread, which i hope will be at least half as epic as hk’s! https://t.co/yCkeDUsvvf

2021-09-12 at 04:29:12: @harveykrishna_ how is this going friend :)

2021-09-12 at 04:23:26: first time reciting a new sanskrit mantra assigned to me; challenging to learn the proper tune &amp; rhythm

not hitting all the right notes yet (super interesting tonally) but getting some phrases right

feeling electric post chanting!
looove using my voice as devotional instrument

2021-09-12 at 03:19:34: i see the waymo cars everywhere and although i could look up what they’re for, i choose not to and instead choose to believe simply that they are up to no good

2021-09-12 at 03:15:35: so is there a [meaningful or not] difference between how much artists are paid if they have a song streamed on soundcloud or spotify?

2021-09-12 at 03:15:35: so how do cannabis companies measure the percentage of thc down to the hundredths place? (mass spec?)

2021-09-12 at 03:15:35: thread of silly questions inspired by curiosity about mundane things

2021-09-12 at 03:01:05: @wholebodyprayer @gptbrooke i love that first one! ha!

2021-09-12 at 03:00:09: i think that @tasshinfogleman’s existence creates waves of ease in the lives of the people he knows and beyond :)

2021-09-12 at 02:53:32: thank you twitter for giving me a forum with which to enter into conversation with myself

2021-09-12 at 02:47:18: my email vibe radar is pretty gnarly. knew now-bf was good from the vibe in the first email i got from him https://t.co/EseZKD3UuM

2021-09-12 at 02:46:18: getting such a good vibe by how clearly prof communicates in emails mmph!

2021-09-12 at 02:34:12: RT @tobyshorin: There are writing days and editing days and just feeling days

2021-09-12 at 01:49:12: crazy to have been a seriously sick child &amp; to also remember being maybe 7 in a ronald mcdonald house, struggling with homework my parents insisted i do earnestly &amp; towards understanding

2021-09-12 at 01:40:14: seems impossible but inevitable that my voice will change in some way in the next 10 years - but how! 

certainly it changed in the last ten years, some of which were childhood and thus of course saw change

i hope my voice gets sweeter and deeper and stronger and kinder 🌸

2021-09-12 at 01:36:25: cacao -&gt; psilocyb microdose -&gt; weed is a really lovely energetic and mental speed/perceptual exploration sequence over a &gt;5 hour period

2021-09-12 at 01:22:03: slow pan for you guys 😌 https://t.co/JGh7UrGQW3

2021-09-12 at 00:31:07: baby’s first phd rotation has been CONFIRMED! we r gonna be diving headfirst into some fun syn bio in the next few weeks :D

2021-09-12 at 00:11:58: isn’t it funny how we sometimes amplify our pain, sadness, insecurity, sorrow - when we don’t get the kind of support we want?

2021-09-12 at 00:07:21: she won’t set you free but she will show you how to set yourself free!

2021-09-12 at 00:03:48: thank you twitter for giving me a space to articulate and lean into my aesthetic sensibilities

2021-09-12 at 00:02:19: thank you twitter for giving me a space to learn and practice how to be unabashedly myself

2021-09-11 at 23:59:05: all packed up ready to head into the late afternoon light for an sf adventure! i think i might dissolve as soon as the sunlight touches my skin

2021-09-11 at 23:41:22: in flow - in water - everything becomes easy - the moon is the light of this faith, lord and lady guiding us with her gravity

2021-09-11 at 23:29:09: i live to discover new ways to show up for those i love!

2021-09-11 at 23:21:26: @ylimedeg holy forearm vein! 🥵

2021-09-11 at 23:20:41: for our entire time together but especially in the past few weeks, it’s become super evident that the forward-thinking way my brain is wired is super different than that of my partner. both ways r superpowers in their own right, tbd!

2021-09-11 at 23:19:28: i have been blessed with tremendous foresight - for good and for bad - a power i can use to invoke futures for my loves and my dears simply by speaking the future into existence

2021-09-11 at 23:16:03: @AClockwork_Crow 😭😭😭 this gave me a good chuckle, thank you for that! can you get a knife sharpening device to help with that side of things?!

2021-09-11 at 23:12:53: @nickcammarata hehe i’d still call it afternoon here, and the day has been wonderful thus far! un-stuck myself from a little rut, had a nice call with my parents, having the best time cleaning the kitchen now, then i’m gonna go for a looong walk and enjoy the sunlight ☀️☀️☀️‼️

2021-09-11 at 23:07:22: @nickcammarata awh nick i JUST thought of you and hoped you were having a lovely saturday evening

2021-09-11 at 23:05:44: @harveykrishna_ sending you love and light ♥️

2021-09-11 at 23:01:27: itching to change my bio for weeks now but the perfect new bio hasn’t come to me yet!

2021-09-11 at 22:52:07: also noting that if i commit to something ~1.5h out it serves as a catalyst for action between now and then

2021-09-11 at 21:59:54: @BonsaiOfLife you are so loved my dear! ♥️ have the best weekend :)

2021-09-11 at 21:57:18: @rhymeswithvocal the only thing that’s offensive about this is the “kinda” !

2021-09-11 at 21:52:06: this is a lesson my parents instilled in me early

2021-09-11 at 21:11:13: in life, entering the space from which dharmically wise, thoughtful, swift action simply flows from you

2021-09-11 at 21:05:03: love when i feel mind working faster and faster, becoming sharper and more fluid and effortlessly effective

2021-09-11 at 21:03:15: @peachblvd i always have a hard time buying my mom gifts, and somehow it is both a revelation and an exciting thought that i can buy her a cozy sweater!

2021-09-11 at 21:00:08: @marsiennex2 what do if think everyone is god

2021-09-11 at 20:55:42: with commitment you can now undertake any suffering nobly, as it is the path you have chosen for yourself rather than the one imposed upon you

2021-09-11 at 20:53:51: sooo what are you gonna do when you finally start the hobby you’ve been idealizing (good on you!) and it ends up being waaay harder than you thought it would be

2021-09-11 at 20:46:18: when you’re in the throes of optionality u forget the sublime joy of commitment

2021-09-11 at 20:41:58: this book has captured both my heart and mind in this moment of my life https://t.co/W22QscpPNs

2021-09-11 at 20:38:47: i’m, like, a pretty good communicator at baseline. thankful for this.

2021-09-11 at 20:34:19: aspiring for my sunday to have both (1) a high, climactic note; and (2) a replenishing conclusion

2021-09-11 at 20:32:05: having a relatively introverted weekend thus far, working through some internal distance between me and myself. not always fun but have the sense i’m on a good trajectory

2021-09-11 at 20:16:08: this is me trying to figure out how often i should aim to be in touch with my general sense of purpose

there are layers of nuance to this: degrees of being in touch, different types of purpose, purpose versus essence

2021-09-11 at 20:13:22: kinda feeling like sense of purpose is something to be maximized on some basis, granularity tbd: moment to moment, daily, every so often

2021-09-11 at 20:10:35: naw it’s not your job to tend to my internal hearth, i forgot to turn and poke at the logs — you could go and grab some wood if you wanted!

2021-09-11 at 20:05:28: silly how much interpersonal friction and general ennui is caused by addressable internal discontent

2021-09-11 at 06:25:48: humbling words for my sometimes hard-headed heart

https://t.co/rMFlYqF9dD

2021-09-11 at 04:40:16: @ulkar_aghayeva :) props to you for having the wisdom &amp; self-knowledge so as to not overcommit yourself

2021-09-11 at 04:27:52: @kehwho hehe started reading a new book today and when i had cried several times in just the first few pages i knew it was gonna be a good read

2021-09-11 at 04:26:47: @_holyweather i am so curious about this response! elaborate if you so wish?

2021-09-11 at 04:08:15: the sort of personal &amp; scientific discussion i’m eager to create space for:

“someone said something, another person disagreed or elaborated, and all our minds were free... you had a right to form the nebulous energy racing through you into words...” https://t.co/lKwEqSqQaT

2021-09-11 at 04:03:27: two hopes i’d have are to:

(1) come out of each session feeling energized &amp; inspired

(2) discuss science &amp; scientific work with people who are at least somewhat acquainted with their spiritual nature

2021-09-11 at 04:01:16: • simplest case would be a sort of journal club, where in each session 1-2 people prepare material for a paper or concept they want to explain to the others

2021-09-11 at 04:01:15: • collectively exploring and constructing a vision for the “kind of scientist” (or researcher) we each want to be - subject matter, philosophical motivations, role models (shulgin, pirsig, &amp; many others)

2021-09-11 at 04:01:15: not sure of exact focus yet but some ideas:

• for a group of people who do science on a day-to-day basis, a “group meeting” where you present your progress &amp; get context of how progress moves for individuals in other disciplines

2021-09-11 at 04:01:15: curious if i have any science-y mutuals who would be interested in a ~weekly science sharing container, conducted virtually &amp; for a 4-ish week test run?

2021-09-11 at 03:39:26: u guys got any full moon plans for sep 20? i’m tryna become the kind of person who has moon based plans

2021-09-11 at 03:19:55: nostalgic window • psychedelic lake • blessed new birks • baby bougainvillea https://t.co/4n6nJAp9n8

2021-09-10 at 23:41:27: feelin like a floaty fierce mess of contradictions

2021-09-10 at 23:39:36: i think the reason my mom’s bout with cancer was manageable was because of intuitive medical care decisions she directed along the way. conventional and intuitive medicine synergize ⚡️

2021-09-10 at 23:22:56: practically this does not seem to be the case!

2021-09-10 at 23:22:24: i think some part of me turns my nose at second-brain systems (roam, notion, etc) because i feel as though if i use them i will somehow be “less than”

2021-09-10 at 23:19:51: i could probably pre-load my weekends with a friday like this: late afternoon cannabis &amp; flow solo session, then evening cacao with or without socialization, then night some form of socialization for sure

2021-09-10 at 23:02:29: it has occurred to me that i often think tasks need to be done at a specific hour (e.g. during the business day), when in fact the time doesn’t matter as much as it causes me worry

2021-09-10 at 22:49:23: @_StevenFan @valor_zhang hehe i did the same mix-up yesterday!

2021-09-10 at 21:00:24: @eIfcup i’m en route to becoming that friend 🙈 microwaves strip the prana from the food

2021-09-10 at 19:30:12: was ambivalent about a book, turned it over to see robert pirsig’s glowing recommendation on the back, have no choice but to read it now

2021-09-10 at 18:54:29: to finding peace amidst optionality

2021-09-10 at 17:23:32: oho i think that under the impatience is fear that i won’t finish setting up the system, and thus that my effort thus far will go to waste

2021-09-10 at 16:44:42: setting up a notion life management system as per a close friend’s recommendation. feeling excitement &amp; a sense of relief as i unload tasks from my brain

but also feeling a rising impatience, wishing system was done already! how to mitigate impatience?

2021-09-10 at 08:44:00: there are some people you can just trust to advocate for and uphold what is Right. deeply grateful for such people

2021-09-10 at 08:32:37: the fact that cats have eyebrow whiskers is a thing that consistently brings me joy. sweet fuzzy little antenna

2021-09-10 at 07:19:27: just watched the alpinist as per mountain-loving bf’s recommendation, and jeez! so inspired to seek experiences that demand immediacy &amp; to become physically strong

2021-09-10 at 01:34:03: really like overcoming little challenges on a daily basis (tricky driving maneuver, administrative task for school, sitting with a negative feeling til it transmutes)

there’s this physical sensation i feel of being squeezed and released which is a little addictive

2021-09-10 at 01:16:34: laughter has this way of reverberating in my body that wears away at lodged tensions &amp; discomforts

2021-09-10 at 01:12:45: had a stressful driving moment and squeaked out a laugh once it passed and was amazed at how good the laughter felt. let this be a reminder that you’re allowed to laugh when things go wrong

2021-09-10 at 01:10:14: life is fraught with little uncertainties now, realizing today what a lovely opportunity i have to burrow into my practice

2021-09-08 at 02:22:10: a couple days ago i talked with prof who was recounting recent animal experiments in their lab, where they injected heparin into rats to trigger a vascular bleed

i remember having a pretty visceral reaction to this. but i guess animal studies are a necessary evil?

2021-09-07 at 22:49:56: @adanguyenx this is incredible! illustrative, clear articulation of the idea of intensity relating to being in touch with your essence; super cool how you intertwined that with longevity; and high resonance with the ways you’ve been in search of your own intensity

2021-09-07 at 22:37:11: i think this is easier as you believe in free-flowing models of consciousness, eg you are me (there is a term for this which i’m blanking on)

2021-09-07 at 22:33:00: let’s move towards creating more frequent moments of intense empathy in life

2021-09-07 at 21:11:54: my favorite line in this song is “something in your eyes took a thousand years to get here”. strikes something deep

https://t.co/RnSUCMc1Hm

2021-09-07 at 00:43:10: a nice thing we can do for others is to inform them when their intuition was correct. bolsters self trust

2021-09-06 at 20:44:09: presence is how we give ourselves to one another, dissolving the ego in one-pointed concentration

2021-09-06 at 08:39:13: hair is finally shoulder length! i think i’d cut it to this length again, but not shorter. feelin myself. as hair gets longer i feel it softens my face and my nature

2021-09-06 at 08:30:45: @wholebodyprayer can you trust a man with two first names ❓❔❓

2021-09-06 at 08:19:08: best labor day wknd i’ve eva had!

2021-09-06 at 08:18:35: sending y’all luuuuv from santa cruz

2021-09-06 at 06:02:57: every woman made in the image of mary • 🕊✝️♥️

2021-09-06 at 05:28:23: if u haven’t seen it, i highly rec lagaan - nostalgic, iconic bollywood movie w aamir khan taking u back to colonial times in india &amp; has an epic cricket match

2021-09-06 at 05:01:55: love pulling dis one out at parties (small cozy hangs)

https://t.co/SoL3OFHpEh

2021-09-06 at 04:34:47: providing sincere words of encouragement is one of my favorite ways to give luuuuuv

2021-09-05 at 05:57:48: in my partner’s arms feeling like i can take proper deep breaths for the first time in days

2021-09-03 at 23:00:50: @twemecetem 😂! i’ll be doing some dabbling this weekend too, may we both enjoy

2021-09-03 at 22:59:17: today i feel a tender, blossoming energy in my chest which makes me feel as if my life is beginning yet again

2021-09-03 at 22:52:08: @twemecetem i’ve had a few experiences where effects took 1.5h to 2h to come on! super strange

2021-09-03 at 22:36:49: @deepfates helpful at all for bookstore market research?

2021-09-03 at 22:26:44: @startingfromnix reminds me of https://t.co/ACchxpxxfy

2021-09-03 at 22:26:08: @startingfromnix such a fiend!!!

2021-09-03 at 18:02:32: under the veil is your eternal nature https://t.co/q5B8roGTyW

2021-09-03 at 09:18:05: remembering now how meaningful it is to do thoughtful, effortful things for those you love 💛

2021-09-03 at 08:53:00: @HanjoYoutaku would you mind elaborating on what you mean? 

my guess is that labels arise as consciousness gains the ability to self-report - via awareness?

2021-09-03 at 08:51:31: @HanjoYoutaku hehe u right

2021-09-03 at 06:43:03: @kehwho people who are experts &amp; various other overlapping categories

2021-09-03 at 06:39:49: @kehwho oooooh yes. importance &amp; nature of support systems has been illuminated to me recently while going thru a little health crisis

feel so loved when i have people who can hold space for tumultuous feelings &amp; people who can run errands when i can’t &amp; people who are parental to me &amp;

2021-09-03 at 06:23:47: feeling like i belong 🥰 thank u universe for keeping me here 😌

2021-09-03 at 04:57:32: such an exciting evening!!! chatted with a prof who was super kind &amp; whose research made my curiosity flame burn even brighter!!! and exciting potential housing situation is unfolding!!!

2021-09-02 at 21:46:11: how do you know that you’re doing your best, both when things are going well and when things aren’t going as well?

2021-09-02 at 21:44:36: if more than one person is interested, i’ll keep you in mind for the next thing i could use an accountability partner for 🥰

2021-09-02 at 21:44:23: would one of you lovely people have about an hour tonight to hop on a call and hold me accountable to doing a thing i’ve been putting off?

time would be in 9-11pm pacific range

2021-09-02 at 21:33:17: @nikitanomo dreamy. how’d you feel when ya woke up this morning?

2021-09-02 at 09:10:44: okay i recently picked up a book on feminine archetypes and it has occurred to me that this may offer me some labels

2021-09-02 at 02:00:45: it may be time to add a one-shoulder top to my wardrobe

2021-09-02 at 01:49:53: i’m content with the newfound awareness i have of these 3 parts: their feelings &amp; even existence!

i’m off to re-enter this evening: build trust between child part &amp; expectations part, with masculine logistics care part being a mediator &amp; voice of wisdom!

2021-09-02 at 01:47:59: i feel that masculine part when i sit down to meditate; when i finish a task; he’s a composite of my dad, partner, and one friend

2021-09-02 at 01:37:37: realizing that expectations part feels like an exhausted parent. can i call upon a part who’s good at planning &amp; logistics &amp; care - to partner with exhausted expectations part?

there is a part like that within me, this part has a masculine, grounded energy

2021-09-02 at 01:33:04: getting the sense that i’ve deviated from the core of the issue, time to recenter in my body

2021-09-02 at 01:32:04: expectations part has to convince child part that it’s worth learning and using tools to work with emotions, even if the pay-off isn’t immediate

@ child part, w/o tools you seem to have a handle on some feelings but with others you just hit that numbness escape button...!

2021-09-02 at 01:30:19: child part might be behind this anxiety amplification https://t.co/k2SmIrk5J5

2021-09-02 at 01:27:25: aw child part wants to know that the way she is feeling is something to be taken seriously

expectations part craves tools to deal with feelings. child part: the feeling in and of itself is enough!

2021-09-02 at 01:25:24: expectations part also wants child part to integrate all the inner work that’s happened during sickness period, which child part views as homework she doesn’t wanna do

can we make the homework more fun? incorporate colored pens and art and movement and prioritize feeling good?

2021-09-02 at 01:22:18: expectations part is like: okay, look child part, we relaxed when you were sick, but we didn’t address underlying problems &amp; now the problems are even worse [problems are probably the same]

child part is like: we aren’t recovered yet! how can’t you see that! i don’t trust you!

2021-09-02 at 01:15:06: @VividVoid_ oh yes me too! it just makes sense™️ metaphysically. i’m super curious about the cellular mechanisms for why this might happen 👩🏽‍🔬

2021-09-02 at 01:14:01: anyways, i think child part felt super vindicated when health became obviously bad, and is maybe clinging on to that now as i recover, and so there continues to be antagonization between child part and ~expectations part https://t.co/vkQK8NO4ya

2021-09-02 at 01:11:29: side note did u guys know that when people get organ transplants they sometimes pick up new, inexplicable leanings towards new cravings &amp; dietary changes &amp; habit changes

2021-09-02 at 01:09:44: @whomademecrispy 🤍!

2021-09-02 at 01:08:40: returning to this “journey” concept: a couple days ago i had an experience which began with reading osho, feeling resonant ideas in my body, which led to me entering a semi-obsessive state &amp; reconnecting to my scientific curiosity — relevant to career part of journey https://t.co/7WYEjMrkFx

2021-09-02 at 01:00:28: guess i’m having an impromptu ~parts work session on the TL 👩🏽‍🔧 https://t.co/aL60MEaZRN

2021-09-02 at 00:59:05: how i’m feeling now is also somehow related to how i create numbness and anxiety on a day to day basis

huh: create numbness to magnify anxiety &amp; thus bring anxiety more to forefront of awareness, via more pronounced physical symptoms?

2021-09-02 at 00:56:24: thanks to the recent inner work, i’ve had this persistent sense of: you knew you were on a journey, but now the nature of the journey is beginning to reveal itself — and its texture is sublime, and points to how to orient inner and outer work

2021-09-02 at 00:53:37: and so one part - child part - was validated by the recognition that health was bad, like, how did it take you so long to see?

one part - opposing part - is relieved i finally have the authorization to release myself from expectations

2021-09-02 at 00:51:17: i’m sensing some self-doubt &amp; lack of self-trust during the time of sickness, like — how bad is it, really? if you can operate close to normal socially, why are you taking it easy with other responsibilities? oh wait, you can’t operate socially, oh wait, this is actually bad

2021-09-02 at 00:48:59: i think the recent stream of inner work has been catalyzed by sickness, which involved (a) an inability to perform at normal capacity externally, and (b) a turn to inner work

2021-09-02 at 00:48:59: my instinct is to get down on myself with disappointment but i think i can do better

2021-09-02 at 00:48:59: noticing i’ve been making strides in inner work while allowing some outer work (external responsibilities) to slip, on timescale of past few days

2021-09-02 at 00:44:13: love when u perceive someone as more and more earnest as you get to know their deal

2021-09-02 at 00:30:55: who told you that you were not to be celebrated in this present form!

2021-09-01 at 03:01:10: time 2 make some delicious masoor dal tadka whilst listening to the jai uttal album my dad always used to play on car rides when i was young :)

2021-09-01 at 02:34:49: little brother got new glasses that make him look all grown up and i’m teary

2021-09-01 at 00:57:40: krishnamurti • osho • “the lazy man’s guide to enlightenment” • ayurveda

2021-09-01 at 00:48:45: feeling drawn to books and teachers which offer me simple truths about the nature of life &amp; the universe, as well as the space to feel &amp; test out the trueness of these truths for myself

2021-08-31 at 21:50:39: i love love love giving books and journals as gifts and writing a kind, personalized, intention-setting inscription on the inside of the cover or on the first page

2021-08-31 at 05:04:57: @the_wilderless your immune system is getting sooo activated now! :D

2021-08-31 at 04:29:59: (2) meditated earlier, which wasn’t obviously fruitful directly after, but seems to have impacted me several hours later

2021-08-31 at 04:29:59: trying to figure out why today’s experience is so lovely &amp; insightful:

(1) provided self with triggers for thought, i.e. got high then sat down with a book and gave self the time to internalize &amp; even contemplate resonant ideas

2021-08-31 at 04:26:48: sometimes my experiences with weed are psychedelic, and sometimes they are less so

am in the midst of a wonderfully psychedelic experience this evening

2021-08-31 at 01:01:40: so it seems to me that a benefit of therapy is that your therapist is able to *label* your behaviors/patterns, based on their training &amp; experience

for self-therapy, where do you source labels from?

2021-08-30 at 05:21:53: i imagine in super homogenous countries like iceland, natives must have an eye for super subtle tells that someone’s a foreigner

2021-08-30 at 04:54:10: having a late night snack with bf now 

and there was a point where he turned his head to the side and we made eye contact in a way 

that reminded me of a way he looked at me before we were together, when we were unsure of each other’s feelings

2021-08-30 at 04:44:13: came on as bf was parallel parking my car and we were stuck, we had to sit in the car and groove until the song ended

2021-08-29 at 20:41:59: @blisstweeting ooh i just started reading this book yesterday! might ping you as i have thoughts on it :)

2021-08-29 at 19:48:49: what if i optimized my life around maximizing opportunities for sentimentality

2021-08-28 at 23:03:53: @prerationalist alexa recognized that this was a good manual fleet that did not deserve to be deleted!

2021-08-28 at 20:08:28: fortunately i can vicariously have this experience through observing pet(s) and bebes of my own!

2021-08-28 at 20:06:46: happy to hold both the strong and soft parts of me

2021-08-28 at 20:02:57: damn i wish i had gotten to interact with a pet cat or dog when i was a baby, think it would have had an impact on how i relate to all forms of consciousness

2021-08-28 at 16:31:02: @nvpkp how lovely!!! 🌄😭

2021-08-28 at 16:29:53: mom called me first thing in the morning to share a sanskrit mantra to reflect on, to bring me peace upon its contemplation. feeling very grateful for her

2021-08-28 at 04:27:41: dope how companies like prenuvo offer preventative medical imaging as a service

the tech (mri) doesn’t even have to be new, what makes a difference is creating a framework for consumers to access, w/o needing a doctor’s order

2021-08-28 at 03:39:31: guuuys i have spaces now! 😭🤩

2021-08-26 at 22:09:29: @tasshinfogleman ♥️♥️♥️ this made me beam!

2021-08-26 at 00:56:37: @taalumot hi taalu! what kinda beers?

2021-08-25 at 06:32:59: @liekovarpio experienced this for the first time a few days ago! was walking &amp; also anemic

2021-08-24 at 23:22:10: if you name your kid seth there’s a 50% chance they end up with a lisp and a 30% chance they end up evil

2021-08-24 at 10:55:07: @_holyweather @myceliummage @pragueyerrr relevant song i’m fond of

https://t.co/Ld1DzmfpQX

2021-08-24 at 00:52:28: @context_ing using lowercase, to me, maybe feels like an expression of comfort? i don’t have to capitalize myself for u!

2021-08-21 at 09:06:50: had a very nice time, people were so friendly! now to fall asleep on friends’ couch in their cozy living room :’)

2021-08-21 at 03:36:22: much love to my sweet boyf who hyped me up whilst i was getting ready

2021-08-21 at 03:34:38: wearing a bomb ass outfit sippin cacao bumpin tunes en route to meet the people who may or may not be my friends for the next 5 years !!!

2021-08-21 at 03:30:23: it’s been a helluva week, now it’s time to have a helluva weekend

2021-08-21 at 02:03:19: @myceliummage exceedingly cozy and omg awwww u just yawned

2021-08-21 at 00:38:41: you know it’s the times that you go out of your way for someone, that get stuck in their memory of you

your way is united with their way, and together you move, in that instance

2021-08-21 at 00:20:18: @erienneyoung @sadalsvvd me too eri, me too

2021-08-20 at 23:22:42: @prerationalist holy hell reading these is the first time non-coercion has made sense to me

2021-08-20 at 03:43:49: back in 3rd grade i used to be so jealous of my blonde best friend whose mom let her have movie marathons at home when she was sick

2021-08-19 at 23:09:19: i’m experiencing some medical issues that should resolve soon, but are nonetheless frustrating

i’m struck by my desires to: feel ownership over my body again, and to not feel alone in the process

2021-08-19 at 23:04:47: you know how amputees have phantom limb pain/sensations? wonder if that’s possible with internal organs that have been removed: phantom appendix pain, phantom kidney tingles

2021-08-18 at 23:43:57: how can you tell that reiki is working?

i think if i had a way to prove to myself that it’s working - beyond faith - i could learn to use reiki faster &amp; more powerfully

2021-08-18 at 23:29:50: with mantra chanting, my sense is that you want it to be as close to perfect as possible, but that there are different and equal ways of reaching perfection: perfect pronunciation, perfect rhythm, perfect devotion

2021-08-18 at 23:23:20: becoming self-sufficient is one side of the coin but too often the only one that gets focused on

u gotta develop self-sufficiency _and_ build a strong support network!

2021-08-18 at 23:15:26: had a moment on the dance floor recently where i realized that both meaning and emptiness are good

2021-08-18 at 22:59:46: truly, information is power

2021-08-18 at 22:58:50: what should the ideal doctor-patient dynamic look like? what other relationship dynamic is it closest to: teacher-student, colleague-colleague, friend-friend, etc?

2021-08-18 at 22:55:48: if i am not an informed patient, i surrender my power

2021-08-18 at 22:49:37: but even now there are parts of that history of which i have little awareness or understanding, and when it comes to that stuff i have to defer to my doctors, who have a more complete understanding

this makes me feel stripped of authority and agency, and a little helpless

2021-08-18 at 22:47:04: my health history is long and complex, dating back to my early childhood

only in the past year have i begun to really take charge of my health; and have sought to understand in depth my health history to date

2021-08-18 at 22:24:05: today i feel some rage towards conventional medicine

2021-08-18 at 16:40:46: “accept that your PI will have some quirks, nobody who goes into research is fully ... balanced”

2021-08-18 at 02:56:15: @archillect @peachblvd thought u would appreciate this aesthetic !!!

2021-08-18 at 02:55:45: @myceliummage love this for u my friend

2021-08-16 at 04:35:30: summoning the strength to go to a dnb thing tonite

2021-08-16 at 00:23:01: @tasshinfogleman @taalumot @Twitter i remember spaces being made accessible to all &gt;600 follower accounts, which i think is silly as a &lt;600 follower account

strange you don’t have it taalumot!

2021-08-15 at 09:33:18: when i think of alcohol primarily as a lever to decrease social anxiety and inhibition, i can get behind it a little more

2021-08-15 at 09:06:32: suddenly realized that many of my dreamscapes involve the university of british columbia (ubc) campus in vancouver

2021-08-15 at 08:31:13: reminded of this mother i met in guatemala, with a 9 year old son via open adoption 

and 8 year old daughter conceived soon after the son’s adoption was finalized, after years of infertility struggles (many such cases) 

and had her family adopted by a mexican grandmother

2021-08-15 at 08:30:14: funny how family can be chosen or blood - but what matters is the closeness of the knit and the support you receive &amp; give https://t.co/IvInoD6ZmY

2021-08-15 at 08:23:35: filled with love for my sister [friend who is the first sister i’ve ever had]

2021-08-15 at 03:57:51: it’s thrilling to find something that matters to you

because by asserting that something matters to you,

you assert that you mean something - that your caring-about-something has power

2021-08-14 at 23:22:30: busy evening today, but i’m hoping that it’s the kind of busy that feels good, flowy, exhilarating

2021-08-14 at 21:04:14: @profeshkitten here is one of my favorite lakshmi chants i’ve ever heard! it’s very warm

2021-08-14 at 18:12:56: @liekovarpio a former housemate i love dearly &amp; who has helped form me into a better person - is a mathematician and loves his work in a way that is contagious

2021-08-14 at 07:29:21: @Preverbalish hehe thank you for giving this little game a try, the answer is your second choice :-)

2021-08-14 at 04:24:49: wanna van life for a week. no more, no less

2021-08-14 at 04:05:26: favorite kind of tea

2021-08-14 at 03:26:36: well guys i think i might be inaugurating a new pfp tonight (truly, reinstating an old one). are u ready for this?

2021-08-14 at 03:11:53: i am trying to help serendipitously organize a little jam tonight and if i am successful i will post some audio clips below

2021-08-14 at 03:03:06: so guys what’s the deal with transcendental meditation?

2021-08-14 at 02:43:37: @twemecetem @taalumot tingles looking at this!

2021-08-14 at 02:42:54: @BecomingCritter @erienneyoung !!!

2021-08-14 at 02:42:07: you all are so delightfully strange it inspires me to be even more delightfully strange

2021-08-14 at 02:41:27: @taalumot @twemecetem i want to watch this too!!!

2021-08-14 at 02:39:53: @nickcammarata ♥️♥️♥️😌😊

2021-08-14 at 01:58:14: love getting my social fix on here :’) feels nice to hang with u guys

2021-08-14 at 01:11:51: @twemecetem 😇 https://t.co/TJf0n0aHsp

2021-08-14 at 01:05:38: @twemecetem hahaha let me link you a similar tweet of mine from when i was in a similar state, digging it up now

2021-08-14 at 01:04:22: @twemecetem in normal life a time i recently felt electric was on my first day in guatemala, taking in anew the intense lushness and volcanic landscapes

2021-08-14 at 01:03:18: @twemecetem oooh i’m imagining you feeling literally electric while having realizations and moments - what a fun feeling that must be!

2021-08-14 at 01:00:29: @twemecetem relevant verse from the bhagavad gita (english verse at bottom) https://t.co/BgbnxCH3kU

2021-08-14 at 00:58:38: @twemecetem getting *started, u kno what i mean

2021-08-14 at 00:58:09: @twemecetem i may have had them my first time, but i didn’t notice! i remember really noticing them on one camping trip in the desert, sitting in the sun beside a huge rock

spirit tingles tend to coincide with the come-up for me, they’re like the first sign that things are getting starting

2021-08-14 at 00:55:34: @twemecetem ah! i was feeling this disconnect, this distance between my head and my body, on a recent journey. the distance between my head and hips felt physically far and clued me into the figurative distance. i was grateful to be able to notice this

2021-08-14 at 00:53:20: @twemecetem mm i tend to feel the tingling bliss up my spine and in my shoulders, love that you have a name for it

2021-08-13 at 23:26:00: @jongold @jondubin 🔥🔥🔥

2021-08-13 at 23:21:25: @twemecetem have a lovely journey! ♥️

2021-08-13 at 23:06:35: @Mancuso681 @goblinodds 🥺 thank you

2021-08-13 at 23:02:03: @BecomingCritter critter this is supremely helpful, thanks for putting this together

2021-08-13 at 22:57:46: @BecomingCritter @goblinodds it seems you’ve missed the mirror!

2021-08-13 at 22:56:37: @goblinodds please no more honest takes, i don’t think i can handle them

2021-08-13 at 22:45:12: @goblinodds going thru my screenshots to see if i can find! and ooomg realizing at one point i had my actual face (before the trend tho tbc 😂)

2021-08-13 at 22:42:55: @ahamletlord @goblinodds i’m in no rush to change! but thank you, i’m very fond of the colors too :)

2021-08-13 at 22:42:14: @goblinodds at one point i think i was a pink anne hathaway &amp; at one point i was also a happy cartoon woman

2021-08-13 at 22:15:04: @goblinodds i’ve been thinking about maybe changing mine but it feels personally iconic to me ... what’s your honest take?

2021-08-13 at 19:48:23: @sadalsvvd 😬😅😌

2021-08-13 at 19:45:53: @liekovarpio have been feeling like i should do some sort of follower celebration at some point, this might have to be it

2021-08-13 at 19:43:57: @liekovarpio omg i am very close &amp; this hadn’t even occurred to me

2021-08-13 at 05:27:40: @temeton_blue stunning

2021-08-13 at 05:26:24: @temeton_blue what the hell

2021-08-13 at 05:24:12: @smallkewlhuman this reply, specifically the concept of “less attached states of awareness” where thoughts can be lighter - has been stuck in my head all day

2021-08-13 at 05:22:44: @nvpkp woah! the video they have with the model is super compelling

2021-08-13 at 04:20:02: gonna let you guys in on my secret for surviving in san francisco: i always wear two layers of pants

2021-08-13 at 03:06:49: no biggie if it doesn’t feel Right! just keep feeling into the sensation and refining your label

and as such with this twitter experience labeling urge. if it doesn’t feel Right, refine it - or release it and melt into the moment :)

2021-08-13 at 03:06:04: there is an idea from the framework of focusing that feels relevant: when you’re focusing and tuned into a sensation, you try to label it - and once you have a label, you check it with the sensation to see if the label feels Right

2021-08-13 at 03:05:29: in fact this twitter-induced urge to label experience often enhances your experience in or after the moment, enabling you to recognize its profundity or relevance

2021-08-13 at 03:05:07: a thing that happens to your brain when you become a very online twitter user is this urge to label, characterize, package your internal experience so it can be consumed on the TL

i don’t think this is a bad thing

2021-08-13 at 03:01:40: @BecomingCritter only slightly ashamed to admit i watched the first episode of paris h*lton’s cooking show yesterday

2021-08-13 at 03:00:41: @joespurpleshirt ♥️♥️♥️ i put in some effort to really capture the moment &amp; i’m glad you felt it :’)

2021-08-13 at 02:55:06: alongside how my body strains as i sprint there arises a felt sensation of my will to live, in sharp relief, and this feeling brings relief so powerful i feel it reverberate in my head, shoulders, chest, and hips and it almost brings me to tears

2021-08-13 at 02:53:37: hurriedly putting on shoes and sprinting to the nearest vantage point so i can witness the sunset

2021-08-13 at 01:49:00: @nikitanomo i too have a skirt i’m wearing that i’m digging! :-) https://t.co/0QathM1YqO

2021-08-12 at 23:36:40: @jongold could you elaborate on the latter, super curious about fleets v stories!

2021-08-12 at 23:32:16: @temeton_blue this is incredibly tender, thank you so much for sharing. you’ve got a sweet lil heart

2021-08-12 at 23:14:11: @nickcammarata relevant sentiment from a past self https://t.co/3VtzLdbmap

2021-08-12 at 21:51:36: what are the things you do that remind you who you are?

2021-08-12 at 21:24:38: @myceliummage @SupaMalaman ime i like to draw awareness to the disproportional cognitive weight of such tasks

so when something starts weighing on me again it becomes marginally easier to recognize how much leverage i have to do the task &amp; liberate my psyche

https://t.co/t0ucPPhLLO https://t.co/3LQmM3GSjG

2021-08-12 at 21:22:26: @myceliummage @SupaMalaman 🧐😮😖

2021-08-12 at 21:16:41: realizing i’m about to join an academic department and with that meet dozens of new people. holy shite

2021-08-12 at 20:53:26: @profeshkitten @_holyweather 😍!

2021-08-12 at 20:49:24: @profeshkitten @_holyweather i had this same experience in montana a few weeks ago! let me see if i can dig up some pictures of colorado mountains to alleviate this grievance even the slightest bit

2021-08-12 at 20:29:36: @Kirsten3531 @peachblvd i’m interested in knowing too! my sense is that you correct any vitamin d deficiency &amp; also do more exercise that strengthens your bones (running, jumping, lifting (?))

2021-08-12 at 04:32:19: @tasshinfogleman 😅😂🙈🥰😌🌌🙆‍♂️🙆🏽‍♀️🌀♥️

2021-08-12 at 04:30:22: RT @tasshinfogleman: @gptbrooke @Witchuals1 @joespurpleshirt @this_is_silvia @the_wilderless @secretpathing @jongold @profeshkitten @taalum…

2021-08-11 at 22:13:19: @nickcammarata tbh i could probably solve this by thinking &amp; simultaneously writing down the essence/sequence of important thoughts, taking care to not spend too long note-taking. freeing space up in brain

2021-08-11 at 22:11:17: @nickcammarata so i try to hold onto those insights so that i can hold onto the entire line of thought, perhaps for future articulation (tweet, writing, etc)

maybe i could get lost in thought of i made peace with letting earlier thoughts go, but what if i don’t wanna do that

2021-08-11 at 22:08:34: @nickcammarata after thinking on this for a few days i don’t think i actually experience rumination! it’s actually more that i think &amp; have some interesting premises/connections/insights, but the max # of insights i can hold in my head &amp; work with is maybe 1-3

2021-08-11 at 21:43:15: @myceliummage aww poor moof sending hugs

2021-08-11 at 21:34:23: @myceliummage it hasn’t happened to me yet..........

2021-08-11 at 21:31:37: the feelings we refer to as negative emotions seem to have significant transformative potential (if you work with them in a useful way) https://t.co/fJi0XYmCoO

2021-08-11 at 21:29:45: i was feeling down a few days ago and a friend lent a listening ear. after articulating my internal state, i asked him: how do i feel better? he said: maybe you need to let these feelings run their course (which i did, and feel better for)

2021-08-11 at 21:27:39: there must be a way to occupy sadness with aliveness, because otherwise sadness feels akin to death

2021-08-11 at 21:23:53: @this_is_silvia what a lovely land this is, a place where the stars feel so close that you can almost grasp them! where we are aware that every footfall is a movement closer to who we are in essence. what a blessed land!

(congrats on 1k! ♥️)

2021-08-10 at 17:25:40: @erienneyoung sorry to hear you’re going through this, the replies to this tweet might give you some ideas: https://t.co/8OJ5iQEZDY

2021-08-09 at 21:46:59: @itsLuciKeller me too :) was listening to it and journaling

2021-08-09 at 21:45:42: kinda grateful for the challenges life is throwing at me, financial and otherwise. remembering and proving to myself that i am resilient

2021-08-09 at 18:37:55: looks like my catalytic converter got stolen :/

2021-08-09 at 07:46:05: @_holyweather @nickcammarata ugh but wait this tension has actually been good in a meta-way

2021-08-09 at 07:43:03: @_holyweather @nickcammarata ime one way involuntary dissociation can be troublesome: have a part that dissociates at recollection of past trauma, which manifests as muscle tension which is hard to resolve

2021-08-09 at 07:37:36: @nickcammarata exhibit b (warm fuzzies when i think about this one) https://t.co/DByIEssenI

2021-08-09 at 07:36:04: @nickcammarata wait i have two tweets about really pleasant dissociation experiences i’ve had let me dig them up

2021-08-09 at 07:24:24: @nickcammarata in psychedelic state there’s this dissociation into past/present selves that somehow helps me (mostly or completely) not experience rumination

2021-08-09 at 07:23:09: @nickcammarata i think it can be either but is primarily the latter (spirals into rumination)

2021-08-09 at 07:15:51: since seeing this tweet have been obsessed with the idea of flow where you forget you have a body https://t.co/Nhjik5YW7o

2021-08-09 at 06:38:24: my inner child summons your older sibling / parental / similar energy:

any words of comfort to someone feeling scared of going to sleep and then having to face the day that awaits?

2021-08-09 at 06:34:59: went to a loud concert experience earlier today and now i feel as though i need several days of silence or quiet to recuperate. nature sounds would be nice

2021-08-09 at 06:30:29: hesse’s siddhartha experienced thinking as a virtuous and fruitful act

2021-08-09 at 06:29:27: getting lost in thought is a thing that feels very good to me in a psychedelic state, but it’s way harder for me to get lost in thought when sober. how to enjoy thought?

2021-08-09 at 06:20:25: @breathofdesire_ hk expressed the immense utility of its frame: in the things that are difficult to you, what part of you is actually enjoying them? and then work to make that part(s) feel happy &amp; supported

2021-08-09 at 06:18:58: @breathofdesire_ so bushra first recommended it to me when i articulated i had a desire to work on my relationships to deadlines, money, and consistency

2021-08-09 at 05:31:20: thinking it might be time for me to read existential kink and have some tools to address avoidance patterns

2021-08-09 at 04:17:38: @deepfates please do!! 🌀

2021-08-09 at 04:15:49: want meaning want levity want intensity

2021-08-09 at 03:56:48: @jondubin i’m starting to implement a ~monthly “life upgrade” purchase, where i buy something (generally in the $50-$150 range) that i’ve wanted, eg contacts, specific type of sandals, etc etc

2021-08-09 at 03:16:23: @deepfates wait what’s her curling strategy (heat, damp hair drying into curls, etc), am interested for myself

2021-08-08 at 18:56:28: about to experience some music and reality warping in a sunny park with some friends i feel super loved around 🥰☀️

2021-08-08 at 17:59:38: @joespurpleshirt @tasshinfogleman hahahaha this is apt

2021-08-08 at 17:51:40: @cIass_man 💯

2021-08-08 at 02:57:56: @smallkewlhuman @nickcammarata thank you for hopping into this conversation, i’m eager to hear more :)

2021-08-08 at 02:57:28: @smallkewlhuman @nickcammarata oooh rapid dissolution sounds like a nice strategy (complementary to the more linear method i’ve sort of described)

could you describe your general technique for an awareness-opening meditation? i suspect i’ve done some such meditation

2021-08-08 at 02:38:40: @sadalsvvd (air quality impact on health &amp; cognition is something i’m suuuper curious about)

2021-08-07 at 23:40:58: sometimes when i’m happy i feel like i’m 5 years old or younger

2021-08-07 at 22:32:14: i could really go for some Techno in the Sunshine right now

2021-08-07 at 20:30:33: @nickcammarata yes to negative but amplified

but this seems to facilitate a transition from predominantly experiencing to predominantly observing, and the latter state is better for insight

2021-08-07 at 20:25:45: turns out that being present with my negative emotions over the course of several hours is a moderately trippy experience

2021-08-07 at 19:04:09: @rhymeswithvocal how do u feel about traffic though

2021-08-07 at 09:56:59: being better at consistently accessing flow states myself will probably enable me to better facilitate flow-y group situations

2021-08-07 at 09:53:50: craving a black nail polish look

2021-08-07 at 09:30:53: there is a voice inside my head that periodically demands, “would you just grow up!”

2021-08-07 at 03:28:35: wearing undergarments that are matching colors consistently gives me a +10 point confidence boost

2021-08-07 at 03:18:38: being able to pay attention to your attention seems like an increasingly important meta-skill, given the mounting demands and ways our attention is played with by technology

2021-08-07 at 03:10:53: look at that tail mid-wag!!!

2021-08-07 at 02:44:55: how do we figure out which drugs are over the counter and which require a prescription?

2021-08-07 at 02:43:49: i love giving my friends excuses to dress up :’)

2021-08-06 at 21:09:13: by being a technologist who seeks to create a personal aesthetic vision, you integrate the classical and romantic sides of your reality

2021-08-06 at 21:02:07: i’d like to cultivate a similar aesthetic, internal vision for something. seems valuable &amp; fun &amp; enriching

2021-08-06 at 21:00:56: still thinking about this thread. antirobust seems to have this vivid internal vision of what the future could *look* like https://t.co/qSJgsdfsel

2021-08-06 at 20:36:05: so i’ve come to associate a headache that’s localized to one temple and has pain of a certain type with dehydration. migraines are similarly one-sided, but a different kind of pain.

what do you all think causes a center-of-forehead headache?

2021-08-06 at 20:07:51: i actually like the reverse framing better but we’ll see how this goes

2021-08-06 at 20:07:15: what percent of things that you set out to do, would you estimate that no one else has set out to do before?

2021-08-06 at 19:59:16: @Tjdriii your cat looks like a more rotund version of my cat! (or my cat is a leaner version of your cat) https://t.co/ljRFQNFOJx

2021-08-06 at 19:44:35: genuinely curious about how these results will shake out

2021-08-06 at 19:43:49: do you feel guilt when you take the last piece of food

2021-08-06 at 03:43:28: @sashintweets @Caroline30 @nickcammarata @BecomingCritter sorry guys couldn’t resist

2021-08-06 at 03:43:16: @sashintweets @Caroline30 @nickcammarata @BecomingCritter poppers? 🙈 https://t.co/c5E3rTDKZp

2021-08-06 at 02:26:23: RT @lilaexpt: @nickcammarata @BecomingCritter personally i’m immensely grateful i didn’t find psychedelics before my psyche could handle th…

2021-08-06 at 02:16:28: @nickcammarata @BecomingCritter i had a feeling you would respond as such!!

2021-08-06 at 02:13:29: @nickcammarata @BecomingCritter personally i’m immensely grateful i didn’t find psychedelics before my psyche could handle them

2021-08-06 at 02:13:04: @nickcammarata @BecomingCritter in the realm of the hypothetical, do you think you would have been ready at age 12? bc perhaps the benefit of doing it more recently is that you had the maturity to do all the self-work needed for a good therapeutic experience

2021-08-06 at 02:05:42: @BecomingCritter @nickcammarata but anecdotal counterexample: i recently read brida by paulo coelho and it was super super high resonance for me, but i tried reading the alchemist a few years ago and was not impressed or compelled

2021-08-06 at 02:04:30: @BecomingCritter @nickcammarata by that logic i could send any book that i’ve experienced as high resonance back in time to a past self and that’d bring me closer to my current experience

2021-08-06 at 02:02:11: @BecomingCritter @nickcammarata i saw in a friend’s writing the idea that: when you read something and it feels viscerally true, it’s because it awakens dormant truth that was present within you

i like this idea, it feels relevant, but i’m not entirely sure if it completely aligns with my experience

2021-08-06 at 01:59:15: discovering how friggin fun it is to dance in the replies

2021-08-06 at 01:58:10: i’ve got a baby zettelkasten fwiw 👶

2021-08-06 at 01:55:09: @nickcammarata damn shame i never got to telling you about my favorite parts of siddhartha

2021-08-06 at 01:54:29: @nickcammarata omg hahaha LOVE

2021-08-06 at 01:53:56: interested in creating robust systems to support my thinking and self-work. i feel like i have a lot of threads &amp; being able to weave them together would increase success, stick-to-it-ness, and insight

2021-08-06 at 01:51:04: bf wasn’t convinced, then he finally got an e-reader, and within 3 days loaded 15 books onto his

2021-08-06 at 01:50:28: highly recommend getting an e-reader bc it makes the delay between being interested in a book &amp; being able to read it almost non-existent

2021-08-06 at 01:47:35: @rmpars ofc i have to make the decision for myself but i’m curious about what you’ve gotten from the book as you get deeper

2021-08-06 at 01:47:05: @rmpars i’m compelled to continue bc later in book there seems to be exploration of how to use systems thinking for social change. and maybe i’ll find other nuggets of wisdom along the way

but i wanted to ask: i’m assuming you’re further along than me, would you recommend i continue?

2021-08-06 at 01:46:07: @rmpars however i’m generally familiar with some of these ideas (feedback loops etc) bc of control theory class in college. and so i’m finding value but also finding some redundancy for myself

2021-08-06 at 01:44:38: @rmpars that first chapter, specifically having a formal definition of system - elements, interconnections, and function/purpose - is kind of rocking my world as far as how i think about creating systems in my personal life. i’ve been sorely missing interconnections

2021-08-06 at 01:43:42: @rmpars okay so i started reading this book after seeing this tweet and i’m through the first chapter &amp; into systems zoo chapter

2021-08-06 at 01:40:23: @sashintweets oooooh! thank you for this rec, will put it onto my e-reader now :D

2021-08-06 at 01:37:36: @nvpkp i am confident you could both figure out a monocle situation and single-handedly bring such eyewear back into vogue

2021-08-06 at 01:36:19: @sashintweets thank you for asking!!

2021-08-06 at 01:36:05: @sashintweets also this ~christian book called own your life by sally clarkson, which is targeted towards women https://t.co/Rjbm6xHcHe

2021-08-06 at 01:34:46: @sashintweets i think it depends on the person bc the stuff with deep resonance for me might not be the same for you!

but recently i’ve really loved:
• siddhartha by herman hesse
• the ~essay “you and your research” by richard hamming

2021-08-06 at 01:30:43: @nvpkp returning to og idea of glasses being too much infrastructure on face, have you found this to be the case with different kinds of frames?

also have u tried contacts?

(i have a light set of glasses i wear always but i’m also keen on getting contacts soon 4 da optionality)

2021-08-06 at 01:26:51: @nvpkp this makes sense! 

i’ve noticed that when i swap my glasses out for sunglasses (no prescription, just for uv protection), my depth perception absolutely goes to shit

any idea how depth perception would be affected w a monocle situation? or maybe not important?

2021-08-06 at 01:24:44: keep reading the things that make you desperately and earnestly want to be Good

2021-08-06 at 01:22:16: @nvpkp do you mean to tell me that you like the aesthetics of monocles

2021-08-06 at 01:21:43: @nvpkp what on earth could have inspired this tweet

2021-08-06 at 01:20:42: @Knipps @deepfates @rhymeswithvocal i am a big fan of this particular ale!!!

2021-08-06 at 01:20:08: @Knipps @deepfates @rhymeswithvocal no worries, thank you for being so gracious! warms my heart :)

2021-08-06 at 01:12:41: @Knipps @deepfates @rhymeswithvocal i’m more then amenable to being corrected nicely

2021-08-06 at 01:06:14: @deepfates @rhymeswithvocal just a word of caution. stay safe out there

2021-08-06 at 01:05:27: @deepfates @rhymeswithvocal once in elementary school i went thru a bag of sour patch kids in the span of a few hours and absolutely wrecked my tongue thanks to all the citric acid

2021-08-06 at 00:42:36: @rhymeswithvocal here u go! have seen you around the TL and think you’re cool :)

2021-08-06 at 00:28:29: i have a lot of “i can’t wait to live with you!” energy towards bf

had i chosen a different phd program we would have just moved in together

there is probably something sweet and sentimental and forward-looking i can do with said energy

2021-08-05 at 21:42:27: @choosy_mom this take is sizzling! i like it

2021-08-05 at 15:54:47: (it may be that each time of day has an inherent energetic quality to tap into; or it may be that each time of day corresponds with a way that you predictably feel or are, due to circadian rhythm, psychology, other factors. either are valid to aspire to more awareness of)

2021-08-05 at 15:51:38: in that transient sleepy phase i have the sense that my subconscious is impressionable. that period shortly after awaking seems to be a powerful time to nourish and prime my subconscious

2021-08-05 at 15:51:38: i do like myself shortly after waking up, observing my mind and body slowly become more active and alert over 30min to 1h

2021-08-05 at 15:48:05: i have yet to experience this for myself, to really believe that me in the mid morning and me in the afternoon are different for any reason other than my own actions. but i think this could be possible!

2021-08-05 at 15:48:05: spiritual texts say that just before sunrise and just after sunset are auspicious and energetically good times for spiritual practice

it is possible, then, that each time of day has an inherent energetic quality that we can tap into

2021-08-05 at 05:14:33: @alrlodallas alas i don’t! but yea it was amazing

2021-08-05 at 04:42:00: @joespurpleshirt (1) speak, and let yourself be known
(2) you are safe, you are safe, i am here

2021-08-05 at 04:11:13: internally debating whether at this moment i’d like a little bit of cacao (raises energy) or a beer (depressant) and realizing that what i really want is a beverage or a process that helps me tap into my inner child

2021-08-05 at 03:18:11: you guys ever achieve a complete - even if transient! - sense of being embodied in the ~reverse gender’s body?

2021-08-05 at 02:25:27: @myceliummage also parts of this!

https://t.co/0I2y1Vk63G

2021-08-05 at 02:23:47: i sense that in a few years there will be a reckoning with my identity, and how closely i want my professional or adult image to be tied to the hardships i faced as a child

2021-08-05 at 01:38:15: seasoned tilapia with agave, curry powder, and salt &amp; threw it onto a cast iron pan. feeling like a master of flavor

2021-08-05 at 01:35:45: realizing that cooking at home within my group house’s communal food plan feels like an experience of wealth. why? i feel like 

• resources are abundant &amp;
• i am not so sensitive to the direct exchange relationship between money and food

2021-08-05 at 01:31:47: thinking about experiences of *wealth* and of *truth*

2021-08-05 at 00:37:33: @Lan_Dao_ this makes me wanna go out and have a nice meal! sending u strength for final night shift 💪🏽🎆

2021-08-05 at 00:12:03: there are some 80’s songs that i listen to and feel that they are keys to long lost tunes in my mind ... would make sense, perhaps these tunes implanted into my psyche when i was young &amp; before i had the ability to put a name to a tune

2021-08-04 at 23:44:02: what’s the point of bass-heavy music if you can’t feel it in your body!!!

2021-08-04 at 19:53:05: @BecomingCritter @altashtree @Knipps @eigenrobot awwwwh! 😍‼️

2021-08-04 at 18:03:01: @temeton_blue in your day to day life how do you interact with people who are living the injustice of not fulfilling their destiny? do you have any way of helping?

2021-08-04 at 17:38:18: @temeton_blue i’m imagining you feeling urgency or fear on their behalf

2021-08-04 at 17:37:53: @temeton_blue oooh could you elaborate?

2021-08-04 at 04:55:16: @nickcammarata hahaha @ “wow neat”
heart touched @ his realization, so tender 🥺

2021-08-04 at 04:53:15: @nickcammarata diving into our respective, specific qualia there yielded a super rich discussion that went way deeper than our usual “i’m ~hindu he’s ~christian” characterization

2021-08-04 at 04:53:03: @nickcammarata !!! when we were at a park two weekends ago and i was on phone with bf somehow i was compelled to ask bf how he experiences god on a daily basis

2021-08-04 at 04:46:50: especially into anything grounded in religious ritual...!

2021-08-04 at 04:46:08: @prerationalist @gptbrooke glad that someone is ensuring we arrive at a consensus pronunciation 🙏🏽

2021-08-04 at 04:37:18: any of you have nice anniversary rituals or traditions? looking to infuse a bit more meaning &amp; care into milestones with bf :)

2021-08-04 at 00:30:09: @sadalsvvd YUM!

2021-08-03 at 21:27:36: so disoriented scrolling through TL with no fleets at top of screen

2021-08-03 at 19:09:12: @empathy2000 hm. so i don’t think instagram is built in a way that fosters community

i think ig is great as a means of aesthetic expression

2021-08-03 at 19:06:32: she asks herself: am i willing to take risks of faith to invest my life in the things of eternity?

2021-08-03 at 19:05:24: 2 chapters in and something i’m finding lovely &amp; unique is the idea of intentionally taking leaps of faith to deepen your trust in God

in this spirit, author went on a multi-year missionary expedition to communist poland and adjacent countries

2021-08-03 at 18:48:26: catching up on dms now. feels so good! thanks friends for being patient and for filling my inbox with so many lovely thoughts &amp; questions

2021-08-03 at 18:19:10: @myceliummage i am genuinely heartbroken today

2021-08-03 at 03:53:21: considered moving onto the next note but after a phone conversation with bf i’ve been convinced to push through the stuckness. i think time for a break then i’ll try alternative generative strategies for synthesis

2021-08-03 at 03:53:21: so the expanding has been done, but the synthesis is proving to be pretty tough! 

i don’t tend to feel stuck when i’m expanding on a thought, but now trying to find a common thread and/or construct an idea arc, i’m feeling pretty stuck

2021-08-03 at 02:01:34: @quotidiania @AskYatharth @nosilverv i still find his way of exploring and occupying reality charming, and so will continue to follow

maybe this is a sign to drop a dm as i’ve been wanting to do for some time

2021-08-03 at 01:59:53: @quotidiania @AskYatharth @nosilverv i have the same question for rival but i also could understand why

(we didn’t interact much on the TL and i haven’t tweeted much more about hinduism, which iirc was the topic of the tweet that coincided with his follow)

2021-08-03 at 01:42:20: @myceliummage no worries friemnd!!!

2021-08-03 at 01:41:44: reveling in acknowledgment of the immense freedom that comes with being young and untethered

2021-08-03 at 01:29:32: @gptbrooke hell yeah. feeling this today

2021-08-03 at 01:18:08: took some deep breaths, moved a bit, now onto #2: on finding strength in a feminine body

this task is a little different from #1 in that i’m both expanding on notes and synthesizing multiple trains of thought

2021-08-03 at 01:13:40: @sashintweets i’m beginning to agree with you, i’ve just internalized the existence of initial discomfort for some time now so it’s a process of reworking the model

2021-08-03 at 00:53:02: @sashintweets the process of starting anything (starting to learn something, to write something, etc) involves some discomfort imo and i feel like i just gotta hang on til i’m past it

2021-08-03 at 00:51:42: @sashintweets i think the notion of there being utility in the time delay induced by paralysis is a nice reframe

if i’m being honest with myself i don’t see much value in the time i spend marinating and waiting for confidence to arise

2021-08-03 at 00:49:50: @sashintweets hahaha no worries i knew what you meant

2021-08-03 at 00:49:14: @gptbrooke @utotranslucence yeah! i should be free :)

2021-08-03 at 00:48:13: @myceliummage OH MY GOD

2021-08-03 at 00:47:20: okay, we are 1 hour and 1500 words in. i finished articulating my current thoughts on #1 and in the process also explored (and moved towards resolving!) some anxiety i have around getting married in the next few years

2021-08-02 at 23:39:07: i’m going to start going through these thoughts in reverse chronological order. &amp; try my very best to take things one step at a time

onto #1: exploring the expansion of identity which comes with parenthood

2021-08-02 at 23:39:06: historically, when i’ve had a backlog of tasks to go through, i feel guilty for letting the backlog accumulate &amp; that guilt obstructs my ability to make progress. i don’t feel guilt (yet) and i’d like to keep things that way

2021-08-02 at 23:33:34: i have dozens of half-baked thoughts in my notes app. the time has come to process thoughts from the past few days and weeks, and enter them into my nascent zettelkasten

livetweeting this process, inspired by @whomademecrispy’s recent livetweeting series

2021-08-02 at 22:40:24: i really like the phrase “coming up on caffeine” bc it makes caffeine sound like a heavy-hitting substance with distinct phases and transformational potential

2021-08-02 at 22:38:31: watching a masterclass lecture coming up on caffeine. priming and inspiring my subconscious

2021-08-02 at 21:49:19: contenting yourself with the *idea* of doing something is a great analgesic but both you and i know the relief is only temporary

2021-08-02 at 21:40:54: this is ringing a bell in my head. feels like the aforementioned state was a semi meditative one. specifically, what i’ll call insight meditation, referencing the buddhist concept (certainly not concentration meditation)

2021-08-02 at 21:31:23: but what was it that made this drive-induced mental state so fruitful? perhaps:

• extended duration
• being constantly in motion
• baseline level of engagement - part of brain is focused on driving, which applies a constraint to what part of brain is available

2021-08-02 at 21:27:11: i think people achieve similar states while running and on long walks

2021-08-02 at 21:25:13: listening to a few podcasts and using speech-to-text to record and expand upon my thoughts supported this state

2021-08-02 at 21:24:15: i’m trying to characterize and generalize the following state:

on a long (5h) drive a few days ago, i was engaged in the task at hand but also tapped into this generative, insightful state of mind

2021-08-02 at 21:15:32: @sashintweets but so often insecurity is paralyzing. have been trying to figure out how to avoid, minimize, transcend paralysis

2021-08-02 at 21:13:56: @sashintweets yeah exactly!

2021-08-02 at 21:00:43: @myceliummage dude how is this even a question. go for it!!!

2021-08-02 at 21:00:23: insecurity is a useful tool once you figure out how to hold and observe it without being consumed or triggered by it

2021-08-02 at 20:29:30: starting to read a book on intentionality written by a christian woman, which includes abundant bible verses and articulations of having internalized jesus’s love as part of your worldview

i think this may help me better understand my partner and his pious, wonderful mother

2021-08-02 at 20:02:18: for a while i’ve had this desire to figure out how i *think*

accessing and understanding how i *feel* is also a work in progress, but way more mature than my conception of how i *think*

some loose ideas &amp; seeds of thought on the way my thinking works:

2021-08-02 at 18:32:45: question for those who are female-identifying: what reminds you of your physical and/or inner strength?

2021-08-02 at 18:11:28: @VividVoid_ holy hell is this apt. surrender is a concept i’ve been working with in earnest for the past week

2021-08-02 at 05:58:08: whew! looks like i’ve got my work cut out for me

2021-08-02 at 05:29:46: familiar?

2021-08-02 at 05:28:51: are you guys familiar with porches’ music? 

bf and i were just discussing how he’s made it big but not huge, and how cool it’d be if he got huge. so this is my contribution towards that goal https://t.co/iv34y2CNhE

2021-08-02 at 01:11:35: @VividVoid_ would luv if you’re still going :)

2021-08-01 at 19:54:11: @taalumot one too many glasses of champagne 😂

2021-08-01 at 19:42:10: two of my friends just got married and i am day drunk at the park at their reception 🥰

2021-08-01 at 19:33:44: RT @nickcammarata: Also being able to control your attention just seems like straightforwardly the way to feel whatever you’d like whenever…

2021-08-01 at 09:19:15: @VividVoid_ oh i like the notion of a code of sexual ethics! 

i see how in your line of thinking, liking your physical appearance isn’t critical. i think my version of “perceiving self as hot” is getting at something a bit deeper, what it is exactly i’m not sure yet

2021-08-01 at 02:07:19: @VividVoid_ seeing self as hot is an individual thing. you become aware of your body or ornamentation or whateva and feel good

having access to sexual power: you have awareness of how your hotness affects other people, how you want to use your hotness

2021-08-01 at 01:51:21: @jongold oh super correlated for sure. perceiving self as hot is maybe precursor for having sexual power. or sexual power is a deep embodiment of perceiving self as hot

2021-08-01 at 01:50:42: @reconfigurthing i’m in da same boat rn my friend

2021-08-01 at 01:48:12: so. being able to perceive yourself as hot is not the same as having access to your own sexual power

2021-08-01 at 01:41:33: emotional pliability is a characteristic i appreciate. demonstrates humility and levity

2021-08-01 at 01:28:16: sometimes when i have my receptivity dialed way up high i swear a whiff of weed can get me high

2021-07-31 at 20:13:49: what’s the wildest display of wealth you’ve seen?

2021-07-31 at 19:47:18: he was like “what if all the extra height went to your legs and your torso remained the same length..... just massive legs”

2021-07-31 at 19:46:24: yesterday night i asked my partner if he would still love me if i was 5’10” and we couldn’t get past the absurdity of the image to come to a decision

2021-07-31 at 19:44:32: realizing this dynamic was enabled by a singular party in february 2021 https://t.co/kvYsx9ghDd

2021-07-31 at 01:23:47: @natural_hazard oh yeah, and i guess you have to explicitly affirm people instead of just liking their tweets (me replying the above tweet instead of just liking it 😅)

2021-07-31 at 01:08:26: @natural_hazard aw heck yea! i love the idea of your ratio but i enjoy liking things far too much to have a chance at maintaining such a ratio myself

2021-07-30 at 21:11:26: @jongold so cute! jongold, bringer of berries and cozy vibes

2021-07-30 at 18:35:24: @AskYatharth oh it might be too late for this but i like to watch the sunset of the day before my birthday. it’s like, watching the sun set on this year of my life

2021-07-30 at 05:57:27: it’s easy to love the idea of someone, isn’t it? harder to love the real person

2021-07-28 at 17:36:58: @sadalsvvd yea i can’t wear diamonds or emeralds bc they don’t suit my astrological composition

idk the exact reason why but it’s what the family astrologer said 🤷🏽‍♀️

2021-07-28 at 01:33:12: @whining_gibbus oh my lord that inner yellow flower ring in the pink non echinacea flower photo.......... holy heck 😭😍😍😍

2021-07-27 at 22:31:58: fiction writing as a method of inquiry

2021-07-27 at 22:24:55: intensely curious about the internal experience of entomologists

how do they relate to creepy-crawlies: are entomologists born with an innate absence of fear or discomfort wrt bugs? do they actively humanize their objects of study? are certain bugs handsome or cute or ugly?

2021-07-27 at 21:34:32: @ahamletlord i really like this idea of self-trusting that motivation will return if the thing is indeed a good thing to do. i gotta believe in future matilda :’)

2021-07-27 at 21:33:05: @moothought if i’m understanding you correctly: sobriety is typically conceived of as a baseline state. &amp; molecular exchange theory asserts that exchange is constantly occurring &amp; inducing mind-alterations. so does this baseline state even exist?

2021-07-27 at 21:16:59: @jongold i think this lines up with my experience. when i chant mantras aloud i feel throat/chest resonance. when i chant internally, i feel more spinal/head resonance

2021-07-27 at 21:15:26: @jongold really like this exploration!! on the topic of mantra recitation, a thought: i’ve heard that internally reciting mantras is actually more spiritually powerful than saying them out loud

2021-07-27 at 21:10:15: hopelessly sweaty from kitchen dancing too hard

2021-07-27 at 20:41:30: @tasshinfogleman hehe i’m partaking in the same thing as we speak &amp; having a lovely time as well :)

2021-07-27 at 20:37:12: @tasshinfogleman oh hai

2021-07-27 at 20:20:47: does this mirror your experience?

2021-07-27 at 20:20:33: often when an idea arrives in my head i can identify the 2-5 factors whose confluence created this idea: a conversation, a passage from a book, a sentiment, a particular emotional state that enabled said idea

2021-07-27 at 20:12:55: put on an exceedingly cute outfit bf has never seen before. excited for when he comes home. simple pleasures 😌

2021-07-27 at 20:05:16: @jondubin hoping your challenges resolve swiftly 🙏🏽

2021-07-27 at 20:05:00: @jondubin my gut got out of wack for about 3 weeks when i went backpacking then did some traveling - but it’s more or less righted itself now without any conscious intervention from me

just an anecdote that maybe points towards the resilience of the gut microbiome?

2021-07-27 at 19:45:06: today is my first day at ~home after three weeks of traveling, and it’s as if i let out a breath i’d been holding the whole time. god it feels so good to be around familiar things and people

2021-07-27 at 19:39:39: so, positing: maybe dehydration induces foggier cognition, which makes me feel tense, which makes it even harder to think

2021-07-27 at 19:38:46: wondering about relationship between muscle tension and dehydration

i have chronic tension [psychosomatically induced] that often makes it hard to think clearly

i also don’t tend to drink enough water over the course of the day. &amp; apparently hydration affects cognition

2021-07-27 at 19:31:48: interested in what other ideas you might have :)

2021-07-27 at 19:31:35: my instinct is to sit down and brain dump via writing: (1) current thoughts on execution, (2) why i’m excited in the first place (capturing the tenderness of these early moments)

2021-07-27 at 19:28:40: just conceived of an intellectual/creative project i think would be extremely good for me to work on

how to work with the initial excitement — how to leverage it into action when the first step isn’t obvious, how to capture it for moments later on when i’m less enthused?

2021-07-22 at 19:00:00: • experiencing the fruit of seeking meaning: i read a chapter in a book that took place in the room that houses the temple of dendur, and i came across said room unintentionally and felt my breath stop in awe. it’s real! i’m here! https://t.co/dPV3IJnpsf

2021-07-22 at 18:59:58: • manufacturing the seeds of meaning: e.g. identifying ancient symbols that evoke something within me and cataloguing them in my mind, eager to see them surface again in the future

2021-07-22 at 18:56:01: • being moved by the size of artifacts, their intricacy, and/or their significance (what a pleasure it is to feel moved)

• experiencing this sense of connectedness to the legions of humans who have come before me

2021-07-22 at 18:51:22: had my doubts about whether i would enjoy going to a museum, but this is actually very good

i feel myself:

• becoming curious, forming questions and accumulating evidence as i look at different artifacts

2021-07-21 at 20:33:35: @ulkar_aghayeva what an absolute sonic treat to listen to! at first it didn’t feel electric but around 1:30 i felt a marked shift and it did indeed become electric for me :)

2021-07-21 at 20:21:53: music recs that will make my body feel electric?

2021-07-21 at 19:26:47: there is a sense of not trusting that my feelings are real, and a fear that if i express myself i’ll come across unfavorably to others. a sense of: i don’t want others to know i’m struggling

2021-07-21 at 19:26:47: when i get caught in negative thought loops, particularly loops i’ve experienced before, my overwhelming sentiment is: how dare you feel this way again! i thought we fixed this

2021-07-21 at 19:26:47: when caught in negative loops, finding i need to remind myself that my feelings are valid and that i am allowed to express my desires

2021-07-20 at 20:50:28: 💧• something special about visiting a lake and touching the water, offering to the water, because this water is self-contained in this pocket of the earth, not like a river where the source and the riverbed by which you sit are one and the same. how does a lake reflect time?

2021-07-20 at 20:37:49: my inner work right now feels like taking glimpses of clarity and finding ways to expound upon them without growing impatient with myself

2021-07-20 at 20:36:25: musing about the symbolism of mountains, volcanoes, lakes, and rivers. you have any thoughts - personal sentiments, relevant words or notions from literature which spoke to your soul?

2021-07-02 at 21:13:13: wanna be able to construct &amp; guide people through powerful experiences

2021-07-02 at 06:15:27: i got a case of the grumps &gt;:(

2021-07-02 at 00:14:22: baby (me) is going on her first backpacking trip this wknd!

2021-07-01 at 20:44:18: @empathy2000 here is my much less thorough train of thought, which reflects how i have begun to go deeper with weed. much more to explore! https://t.co/FTs71bohxt

2021-07-01 at 20:43:07: @empathy2000 this tweet onwards is hormeze’s articulation of his thoughts on / relationship to cannabis. he hits on a lot of good points, re: roles weed plays, culture, what states weed promotes, how to work w weed https://t.co/jutVDfY3FF

2021-07-01 at 20:41:38: @empathy2000 i think it’s worth trying! to perhaps prime you towards having a good &amp; fruitful relationship with weed, i’ll share two trains of thought:

2021-07-01 at 03:04:37: how come no one told me that making an action into a practice would be fun &amp; feel rewarding!

2021-07-01 at 02:09:23: @the_wilderless got so excited once i saw this tweet, this is a warm and lovely idea and i love the nice stuff you’ve posted about so far &lt;3

2021-07-01 at 01:18:02: @yolkoracle this is a good look

2021-07-01 at 00:18:45: unsure how much more i’ll say on this, but wanted to share. happy to chat over dms

2021-07-01 at 00:18:44: recently i’ve been working on become more aware of my sexual energy: how it ebbs &amp; flows &amp; builds. this has unexpectedly helped me create momentum and make progress on sexual healing

2021-06-30 at 17:53:42: @nikitanomo like, far exceeded

2021-06-30 at 17:49:45: @nikitanomo i literally came up with a checklist after a string of hook-ups and chaotic quasi-relationships. bf checked off all the boxes 3 weeks in &amp; has exceeded any expectations i had since

2021-06-30 at 06:55:10: @powerbottomdad1 :D

2021-06-30 at 01:26:07: @tasshinfogleman happiest of birthdays dear tasshin 🌞

2021-06-30 at 01:23:28: @Lan_Dao_ have fun! soak it all in ☀️🏙

2021-06-30 at 01:01:59: @cosmotechnic !!! 🌞❤️

2021-06-30 at 01:01:21: @cosmotechnic huh. now you’ve got me thinkin

2021-06-30 at 00:24:10: @Lan_Dao_ this is accurate. u gonna be in town next week?

2021-06-29 at 23:02:57: @hormeze @nickcammarata this and next two tweets are so fucking lyrical, the tenderness, sweetness, &amp; complexity of your relationship to cannabis are evident

2021-06-29 at 23:01:04: @hormeze @nickcammarata dude it took me years to unlearn this hahaha

2021-06-29 at 22:59:03: @hormeze @nickcammarata interestingly the first profound experience i had w recognizing i had latent energy in my body, which i was allowing to grow stagnant (unexpressed), was on low dose psilocybin. but weed also helps me see this now

2021-06-29 at 22:56:17: @hormeze @nickcammarata this aligns with my experience, “latent unexpressed energy” is phrasing that feels very apt to me. funny in your next tweet you pivot to culture, bc my introduction to weed in college ofc did not involve any movement!

2021-06-29 at 20:08:27: @hormeze @nickcammarata here are some of my thoughts https://t.co/FTs71bohxt

2021-06-29 at 20:06:47: @hormeze @nickcammarata woah i hadn’t heard about novel cannabinoids - they’re in the works? &amp; if you’ve previously tweeted about how cannabinoids work for you, would love to be directed there :)

2021-06-29 at 05:19:33: i finished a fiction book i very much enjoyed earlier today, and its sparkling conclusion &amp; resonant notes still evoke flickers of joy as i go about my other tasks this evening

2021-06-29 at 05:13:13: who’s up

2021-06-28 at 02:40:53: i feel like getting in my car &amp; driving a long distance. perhaps i will make this a reality tomorrow

2021-06-28 at 02:29:39: the way you live your life is how you articulate your values

2021-06-28 at 01:59:38: @sadalsvvd amazing!! thank you, i knew you might have an answer for me :)

2021-06-28 at 01:48:46: came across a 3 of clubs on my walk. what does this mean https://t.co/T0E62qVKQ6

2021-06-26 at 22:52:24: @isosteph what are your fav mountains proximal to sf? i go on plenty of lil hikes but want to up my game. finding mountains near LA somehow feels easier, since u can see them in the distance

2021-06-26 at 22:44:37: purification is a daily task

2021-06-25 at 19:35:49: @moothought thank you, as always, for your presence 🤍

2021-06-25 at 19:35:26: @moothought @joespurpleshirt i keep on reminding myself that what i want, too, is to be able to bear witness to what i can. and this gives me a great deal of peace

2021-06-25 at 19:33:58: @moothought @joespurpleshirt moo this is a tweet i’ve recalled multiple times while going about my day, there’s at least one other one like this — ah, this one: https://t.co/s3C2MnmdJB

2021-06-25 at 19:15:39: art as closure

2021-06-25 at 19:15:28: art as integration

2021-06-25 at 19:07:49: @AskYatharth my middle name is my grandfather’s name, who died shortly before i was born. every child in my generation on my dad’s side has the same middle name

2021-06-25 at 01:31:26: @hapsavage yes this i know. i meant the conglomeration of unofficial camps this year - https://t.co/SI0a8r9sV8

2021-06-25 at 00:52:11: @BryceBesler there’s definitely a part of me that wants to go, but i’m not sure if it’s the right decision bc financially &amp; time-wise

2021-06-25 at 00:47:39: asking you guys bc i generally trust your judgement &amp; many of you are experienced burners

2021-06-25 at 00:44:49: should i go to burning man

considerations: it’d be my first time, the camp i’d probably go with has a $550 camp fee, i would have to skip ~1 week of school

please feel free to explain your response

2021-06-24 at 22:57:08: feeling so anxious about money! i could attempt to process this intellectually but i think i’ll just pray to lakshmi for clarity and peace

2021-06-24 at 07:10:20: @jongold oh good lord what’s the mountain on the horizon? 😍

2021-06-23 at 23:16:28: @proparerga why u waking up so early?

coincidentally i might also be waking up very early tomorrow

2021-06-23 at 21:38:58: @temeton_blue yea me too lol

2021-06-23 at 21:32:32: @temeton_blue i don’t think we disagree

2021-06-23 at 21:32:23: @temeton_blue i think u gotta make yourself more receptive to the inflow &amp; that to me feels like a form of seeking

2021-06-23 at 21:29:36: @temeton_blue hm. are u asserting that warped perception is bad

2021-06-23 at 21:27:42: @temeton_blue there r good &amp; bad ways to seek imo. the bad stems from when you’re seeking to run away from reality / yourself. the good is the pursuit of honest ways of knowing

2021-06-23 at 21:24:53: @temeton_blue if you’re not seeking what are u doing. seeking is an intention

2021-06-23 at 21:24:31: @temeton_blue i think you gotta seek 🤷🏽‍♀️ &amp; cultivation doesn’t strike me as the perfect word, but it also doesn’t strike me as inaccurate

2021-06-23 at 20:50:27: @temeton_blue i’ll admit i dabble in such substances but i am continually cultivating psychedelic ways of being in my daily life

2021-06-23 at 19:39:17: stunning how some people have such naturally psychedelic ways of being without ever having taken such substances

2021-06-23 at 19:28:18: let’s see how far we can travel with this line of thought before the pressure to capture overwhelms the novelty of new metaphorical terrain

2021-06-23 at 19:04:20: usually cacao + music is a favorite combination of mine but today i did cacao + getting immersed in reading and wow i’ve worked myself into quite a state (this is good)

2021-06-23 at 19:01:14: @sadalsvvd so friggin cool!!! excited to see how this unfolds...

2021-06-23 at 18:17:26: @nosilverv i’d wager that a larger proportion of your following feels strong positive sentiment towards u relative to shyte accounts :’)

2021-06-23 at 03:38:10: @yolkoracle something about this particular misspelling, amgstpoast, is really getting me. cracking up

2021-06-23 at 03:08:49: @kehwho me too she’s hysterical

2021-06-23 at 03:04:18: “when you can access that continuum of how _you_ perceive, that’s when you really start to trust” !!!

2021-06-23 at 02:51:49: “if we can bring the healing gifts we receive every day from the earth back into our dinner conversation... it’s great when you manifest something, but [recognizing all of] what is given to us _every_ day...” banger banger banger

2021-06-23 at 02:31:06: inspired by this podcast episode. i have mixed feelings about this pod. some episodes are great, some not so much. but handy for new ideas &amp; broadening horizons

https://t.co/ovKMyXbKbD

2021-06-23 at 02:29:50: have officially been inspired to dive into traditional indian cooking, 

(1) to connect to my ancestry now &amp; to be able to transmit it to my children

(2) to learn how to use herbs to support health in a preventative, proactive way

2021-06-23 at 02:23:57: woo and science have a similar sort of complexity &amp; also a similar signal to noise ratio

2021-06-23 at 02:07:25: i would like to go on a plant walk

2021-06-23 at 01:43:05: have any of you worked thru multiple weeks of the artist’s way? 

if so, what did you get out of it / what did you begin to notice within yourself?

2021-06-23 at 01:16:05: @yokaihainen would post but am embarrassed by how low steps yesterday &amp; today are. week avg is 9182! heading off on a long walk now thanks to this tweet...

2021-06-22 at 21:36:19: i think there is an art to figuring out the stories you tell yourself about the hardships you’ve been through, neither trivializing the suffering nor overburdening yourself

2021-06-22 at 21:07:23: @hormeze awww! love our unique sentimental memories overlaid over the same physical terrain

2021-06-22 at 18:06:55: @hormeze did this on 4 hr train ride from seattle to vancouver on a strikingly clear and sunny day &lt;3

2021-06-21 at 01:36:37: every time he walks by i - i - i -
i think of dropping down a note
it’ll fall to the ground in front of his feet
and he’ll bend down and unfold it, it says:

look up, i love you
look up, i love you
look up, i love you so much

2021-06-21 at 01:35:57: there is a boy who walks under my fire escape
i see him every other day
sometimes he walks fast
sometimes he’s on a call
sometimes i listen in

2021-06-17 at 19:39:06: i’m kind of obsessed with this process, because it’s everywhere &amp; it’s essential. if you’re gonna be a rationalist or a scientist or a buddhist or or or ... there’s a set of principles &amp; you have to figure out how *you’re* gonna live and breathe them

2021-06-17 at 19:33:52: i think a lot of religion/spirituality/life is figuring out which principles to live by &amp; how to live by them

and there’s a process of internalizing principles. where you go from reading texts and learning the vocabulary to actually *living* by those principles

2021-06-17 at 19:26:47: was talking to a friend recently and she rephrased what i said as “the karma yoga of daily life” and i’ve just been absolutely obsessed with this phrase. keeps ringing through my head

2021-06-17 at 19:23:46: am being very social these days but am also seeking to honor the little whisper within me that wishes to slow things down

2021-06-16 at 22:59:22: @Tjdriii i don’t disagree with you on the latter point &amp; i think it’s natural to go through phases of feeling bad at meditation. guess we’re stuck with each other :/

2021-06-16 at 21:53:30: mood. i am learning to consciously love and honor my suffering. i think i knew how to do this as a kid but being an adult means knowledge is no longer pure knowledge, it has implications https://t.co/do93FkRcZu

2021-06-16 at 21:50:50: right now: had a nourishing lunch, took my vitamin d &amp; imagined my bones getting stronger, now outside tramping around in nature

2021-06-16 at 21:49:24: i haven’t had significant insecurities about the size or appearance of my body since like 2018

i have however not felt confident in the health &amp; strength of my body, and felt this w particular strength for past 2 years

but i am feeling now that i’m on the right track :)

2021-06-14 at 05:20:19: @tobyshorin so kind of you to say! :~)

2021-06-14 at 04:51:04: @tobyshorin heck yeah! 😌

2021-06-14 at 04:48:43: oh what a difference a day makes!

2021-06-14 at 04:48:21: the writing fear i had relates to how i used to work/write as an adolescent &amp; in undergrad. i felt i couldn’t break free of my bad patterns. but today i had the energy to start learning &amp; implementing a new pattern, which i feel very excited &amp; heartened about

2021-06-14 at 04:45:36: that tender excitement &amp; reconnection to my sense of curiosity set the tone for my whole day today, and the fear(s) i had related to school now seems small compared to the fierce, inquisitive light i know shines within me

2021-06-14 at 04:43:05: then last night i had some dreams, which involved a civil engineer friend and a random other person enthusiastically explaining a concept from their discipline

the thought that rang through my head when i woke up was this excited sense of: i guess i actually really like school!

2021-06-14 at 04:40:37: i then re-articulated these fears to bf on that same drive &amp; got his initial input on them, which allayed but did not fully resolve fears

2021-06-14 at 04:39:22: notes on a non-linear fear resolution/mitigation process:

yesterday i was driving home and to entertain myself i started singing to myself &amp; in the process unearthed a couple of my fears, two of which related to

• starting more school come this fall
• writing

2021-06-14 at 03:46:01: today the thought of how nice a standing desk would be passed through my mind &amp; i re-resolved to search for one. didn’t expect things to work out so quickly!

2021-06-14 at 03:44:48: couple weeks ago i drove to oakland early one morning, took apart a standing desk, was about to pay $100, only to find that the desk wouldn’t fit in my car

2021-06-14 at 03:43:51: been wanting a standing desk for weeks, just found a shelf-like thing on the side of the road that will work quite nicely :D

2021-06-14 at 02:07:55: and then i’m gonna get back to doing things!!! life is good

2021-06-14 at 02:02:29: now i’m gonna go for a walk in the evening light &amp; sip cacao from my favorite thermos :)

2021-06-14 at 02:01:32: guys i’m having a very good day - doing things i’ve been avoiding, continually tuning into my felt-sense, being attentive to my physical needs, consuming &amp; creating :)))

i’ve been wanting to make a similar thread myself &amp; i think this has given me the inspiration and guidance to go forth and do so :)

2021-06-12 at 20:07:04: feeling like a little trip to mendocino sometime this week

leave early one morning, spend the day in silence &amp; contemplation, alternating between exploring &amp; writing. sleep there, wake up to forest sounds, then drive on home

2021-06-12 at 19:43:47: just gotta live earnestly and everything else will fall into place

2021-06-11 at 22:43:00: @goblinodds tangential but last week i had a first appointment with a nurse practitioner  who rocked my world, she was so good &amp; knowledgeable &amp; empathetic

2021-06-11 at 19:58:07: i think i am becoming acquainted with a grittier reality these days

2021-06-11 at 19:56:54: nostalgic for feb/march of this year, i remember existing perpetually in this strange dream-like state, where work weeks would float by with time only punctuated by dazed, delirious, delightful drug filled weekend nights

2021-06-11 at 07:13:51: @DiamonDie yes indeed! past tense indicates yesterday &amp; future tomorrow

2021-06-11 at 06:06:04: a silly thing about hindi is that the word for yesterday &amp; the word for tomorrow is the same friggin word

2021-06-08 at 04:56:50: .@Lan_Dao_ curious about how learning/practicing medicine has shaped how you deal with physical pain: patients’ pain and your own pain, when you experience it?

2021-06-08 at 03:43:56: room is finally all clean and i feel amazing!

beyond mean/median, in biochem i’ve seen enzyme kinetics described w diff eq which is a little more involved

2021-06-07 at 22:52:51: @temeton_blue maybe tonight is the night!!!

2021-06-07 at 19:25:50: it is my job now to follow my doctor’s instructions, to take my medicines consistently, and to continue to do my research

2021-06-07 at 19:24:43: thanks to a doctor’s appointment last week, for the first time in over a year i don’t feel as though my body is in a state of complete disrepair &amp; dysfunction

2021-06-07 at 18:56:10: @ArtirKel godspeed my friend! fortunately i don’t have to pack today. sending you strength, feel free to send me before/after photos if that’s your jam

2021-06-07 at 18:52:11: room has been accumulating mess for past few weeks, with traveling, hurried departure, tiredness...

standing in my room now makes me feel tense &amp; evokes shame. time to clean room &amp; observe my emotions in the process

2021-06-07 at 01:51:35: @moothought i think the writing will be cathartic and lovely and will rush out of me when i sit down to do it, and am hoping to allow myself the space to do this. perhaps first i will hang, then i will clean, and then i will write :)

2021-06-07 at 01:48:40: @moothought 😂🙏🏽

2021-06-07 at 01:35:47: can’t tell if i am in the mood to hang, write, or clean. what to do!

2021-06-07 at 00:43:51: @BecomingCritter @TetraspaceWest i’m merely protecting bf by grounding him w my lower center of gravity

2021-06-06 at 21:18:28: • soaked up esoteric hinduism knowledge from my mom
• made progress on processing my most significant current trauma
• identified a couple new patterns within myself instilled by family dynamics

2021-06-06 at 21:18:28: i spent the past week &amp; a half at my parents’ house. in retrospect this time was quite eventful:

• [redacted milestone event]
• moved out of an apt
• had 2 important doctor appts
• had a significant fight w parents

2021-06-06 at 02:26:29: • had to give a speech about a thing that’s close to my heart &amp; causes me a lot of pain ... to my entire undergraduate student body and then some. i couldn’t help but cry at one point in speech. couldn’t shake sense i was oversharing

2021-06-06 at 02:24:02: just woke up from stressful dreams: 

• invited to fancy awards dinner but had to catch plane to go home, but also had fomo from not being invited to any after parties

• was given a drug who i didn’t fully understand &amp; had to be chill at awards dinner under unknown influence

in case some part of you wants to experience community living i’d just point out that some cities have a scene &amp; you can join an established house, which is easier than going full buy-in &amp; starting commune

2021-06-05 at 11:04:20: @reconfigurthing out of curiosity, have you lived in community living / co-living / commune situation(s) before?

2021-06-05 at 00:25:50: @rbbrbrrn wholeheartedly support

2021-06-04 at 02:39:40: when did you realize your parents were cool?

2021-06-03 at 22:49:19: TIL that if you’re taking a vitamin D supplement &amp; you’re washing it down with water, you’re not getting optimal absorption

vitamin D isn’t water soluble; it’s fat-soluble. so you should take the supplement with a fat (avocado, peanut butter, yogurt, etc)!

2021-06-03 at 21:58:16: @shannincurry @nickcammarata ah yes east of eden!!!

i moved to a new city in the middle of pandemic &amp; was very lonely &amp; that book singlehandedly got me through that period of time. steinbeck’s non-linear narration is just incredible

2021-06-03 at 21:55:05: @empathy2000 i think this is an interesting question but i don’t fully understand it - maybe my confusion lies in what you mean by reclamation of personal aesthetics?

2021-06-03 at 20:10:06: @eggprophet nooo i have terrible tan lines from my birks already i gotta wear socks

does this align w any of your contemplations/experiences?

2021-06-03 at 03:17:42: u know when you realize that some subset of stuff in your brain that you thought was obvious

2021-05-31 at 00:42:41: i have a feeling that in both cases, i have to start somewhere and allow myself to be guided. the starting is hard

2021-05-26 at 23:15:03: @Lan_Dao_ just extending an invitation for you to elaborate on your definition of enlightenment if you so wish! ☺️

2021-05-26 at 22:46:42: which is dominant in the current phase of your life (defined however you see fit)

2021-05-26 at 20:38:17: • who knows, maybe there r nonlinear ways to decompress über fast, that i just haven’t discovered yet! exciting possibility

2021-05-26 at 20:38:17: • i have a tendency to accumulate stress as tension in my upper back/tension, and typically have a hard time dispelling it. hoping more attention to continual decompression will enable me to rework this tendency

2021-05-26 at 20:38:16: i am excited about this active practice notion because

• i’m eager to tune into body &amp; learn more about dynamics of stress formation &amp; release. i’m also curious abt stress in a mechanistic, science-y way, so in addition to reading papers abt cortisol i’ll have experiential data

2021-05-26 at 20:38:16: i imagine an active decompression practice w the following characteristics:

• can be done at conclusion of work or intermittently while working

• maybe involves grounding / recentering via meditation, breathing recalibration, going outside, reading a soothing text, chanting

2021-05-26 at 20:38:16: my current model of decompression is passive &amp; typically occurs after a block of work, i.e.

(1) turning “off” from work/stressful task once finished

(2) on rare occasions i set intention to unwind while watching youtube or similar. no conscious embodied sense of unwinding [yet]

2021-05-26 at 20:38:15: i have a desire to explore active decompression practices

2021-05-25 at 16:06:19: feeling in my element today &amp; even yesterday! wonder if i can keep this going

reminds me of when i was making peace with choosing a phd program i wasn’t super excited about. i oscillated wildly: felt excited one day, and filled with dread the next

2021-05-25 at 05:02:33: @BecomingCritter bc dude this is thematically exactly the vibe

2021-05-25 at 05:01:51: @BecomingCritter are u archillect

2021-05-25 at 04:56:20: just revealed my twitter to a irl friend, and as she’s going through my profile, she goes, “wow, you tweet a /lot/!”

made me laugh. yeah, it’s fun i’m largely happy with my twitter-life integration status

2021-05-25 at 04:44:41: • the dual mechanism i posit: 

(1) the body high makes my body more fun to occupy, so i gain intrinsic desire to do things

(2) the altered state makes me more interested in probing my limits &amp; nature, because in an altered state it feels more fun

2021-05-25 at 04:43:13: some further notes:

• indica/hybrid works for me in this regard, sativa does not. i think sativa makes me indulgent in a way that isn’t soul-nourishing

2021-05-25 at 04:41:48: hear me out: i think weed makes me productive - in contrast to being lazy - in that it makes me more likely to actively do things i enjoy doing (yoga, singing, challenging my body’s physical capacities, thinking deeply about the questions that stick with me)

2021-05-25 at 04:33:04: okay guys hold me to this - gonna make a recording of me improv-ing to some guitar chords &amp; find a way to distribute it (maybe soundcloud)

2021-05-25 at 04:22:40: conceptualizing my first time in a new city as a tender psychedelic experience

2021-05-25 at 02:05:10: @powerbottomdad1 @embryosophy oh of course, it makes for phenomenal content

2021-05-25 at 02:02:23: @powerbottomdad1 80mg is absolutely bonkers to me, in my world 3.5mg is cozy, 5mg is a little wild, and 10mg gets to be too much. as for your back i think it’s the one below your neck

2021-05-24 at 22:45:49: @relic_radiation ah! from a quick glance this looks promising, thank you for sharing 🤍

2021-05-24 at 20:24:20: @VividVoid_ awh now i’m teary eyed

2021-05-24 at 20:21:47: workin on striking a balance between stream of consciousness posting &amp; more thoughtful, crystallization-of-a-line-of-thinking posting

these are not mutually exclusive, but are distinct

2021-05-24 at 20:11:07: @erienneyoung i only discovered runny eggs in the past year or so, since growing up we either never ate eggs or just had them hard boiled! sunny side up i have down, but overeasy is still challenging - any words of advice?

2021-05-24 at 17:07:58: just a thought if any of you have cartilage piercings that aren’t healing: try switching the metal your studs/hoops are made of 

my double helix refused to heal til i switched the piercings from the original metal (unsure exactly what, maybe steel or silver) to gold

2021-05-24 at 16:21:15: i’ve also spent the past year of my life pondering cities in california, and as much as i love california, and as much as the sf/la dichotomy is in the fiber of who i am right now! — it’ll be very nice to explore other cities. this country is so vast!

2021-05-24 at 16:17:54: so friggin excited to explore new cities!!!

i feel cities are these magical massive conglomerates of human beings: humans who are alive now, living &amp; moving on the city backbone created by humans who lived before. i get this feeling whenever i stand atop a hill in sf &amp; look down

2021-05-24 at 16:13:51: i used to speak super formally when i was younger &amp; sometimes i feel myself regressing to this &amp; i feel stilted &amp; strange

2021-05-24 at 16:12:18: i think this will be a great deal of fun provided i can survive the lack of sleep!

current plans include spending most of tues in boulder &amp; most of wed in south beach :)

2021-05-24 at 16:09:59: so i am heading to the east coast for the next week and a half. yes, i could have booked a direct 6h flight. instead i booked a series of flights that will take 44h 😅

i leave sf tonight &amp;
5am-10pm tues in denver
5am-9pm wed in miami
(&amp; reunite w family midnight wed ☺️)

2021-05-24 at 16:00:42: @harveykrishna_ @jm__prod here to second this

2021-05-24 at 15:35:33: @tasshinfogleman she then says - and this blew my mind at the time - you don’t have to shed these people! instead, try sharing what you’ve learned, and see if they want to join for the ride

2021-05-24 at 15:34:11: @tasshinfogleman reminds me of snippet from hitomi mochizuki youtube video, where she talks about how as you change &amp; grow, spiritually and otherwise, you can feel like you need to shed friends who you feel you no longer connect with...

2021-05-24 at 15:27:40: i.e.

• kind, present, &amp; nourishing in my interactions with others
• working to align my outer and inner worlds
• tapping into the just-below-the-surface joy of the mundane and the joy of the difficult things

2021-05-24 at 15:25:57: today i am trying in earnest to be Good. this is like all other days but today i’ll try starting off by thinking concretely of this intention

2021-05-24 at 07:27:29: exceedingly social day today, brain is buzzing in a pleasant way! 

woke up, chatted with housemates, went to a brunch hangout, then a dinner party, then chatted with a friend who stopped by the house, texted with a college friend i hadn’t talked to in a while, then some dm’s

2021-05-23 at 20:57:19: hope 2 plan a long amtrak adventure for this summer :~)

2021-05-23 at 20:45:18: lol i went into a trance state while singing in a jam session last night that was pretty lit

2021-05-21 at 00:41:49: @selentelechia hearing about baby’s health and milestones and personality in your tweets makes my heart so happy. sending you guys much love!

2021-05-21 at 00:04:42: @burningcopium i was bein a little vague, to clarify a little this burden is a little psychological, a little physical, and a little spiritual

2021-05-20 at 23:48:45: heavy burden feeling heavier than usual. wwyd to ease the pain?

2021-05-20 at 19:44:01: @tubaesquire @BecomingCritter @maybegray aw this episode had a similar effect on me! fond memories of listening to it on a long drive up the i-5

2021-05-20 at 18:39:54: just introduced myself on phd cohort discord, was intensely earnest and i can tell it’s making people a little uncomfortable hehehe

i think it is just period pain! this is my first period in a couple months so i think the pain is hitting me unusually hard

i think this is common for children of academics &amp; is another facet of an academic career that gives me pause. not really conducive to putting down roots

2021-05-12 at 23:21:20: @nibrasibn woah! could you elaborate on how your dad’s religious devotion shaped where you guys lived?

2021-05-12 at 03:28:31: @gptbr00ke @selentelechia i’ve been strangely irritable!!!

2021-05-12 at 03:27:45: @NibiruDakini hell yeah, thank you 💛

2021-05-12 at 03:21:42: @NibiruDakini how will i find my spiritual teacher?

2021-05-12 at 03:03:56: (5) perhaps a reconceptualization of athleticism: i feel *strong* when i hold yoga poses &amp; am able to support myself thru my breath. 

and so in other athletic things where all i used 2 be able to think about was my lack of stamina, i can now see my strength 😌

2021-05-12 at 03:03:12: (4) exposure to and excitement about new ways of movement, i.e. new ways to move with the energy in my body! - yoga, qi gong / tai chi, flow arts, modern dance etc

2021-05-12 at 02:52:26: (3) nascent understanding of how the mind and body relate to one another, e.g. framework of yoga • pranayama • mantra japa • dhyana • and so on. that is to say, any practice is fundamentally both mind and body &amp; awareness of this duality makes any experience richer

2021-05-12 at 02:51:10: (2) nascent faith in time’s accumulative &amp; transformative power: i never thought my stamina could increase through regular exercise • i never thought that spiritual growth &amp; purification was something to aspire towards daily, whose benefits would compound

2021-05-12 at 02:49:25: (1) nascent desire to *be physically strong* for the sake of my spiritual growth. another way i’ve seen this sentiment articulated: a desire to “make this body a safe vessel for my spirit to rise” 🤍

2021-05-12 at 02:37:43: several reasons for this:

2021-05-12 at 02:34:17: loving that spiritual exploration has also coincided with me discovering my capacity for athleticism

2021-05-12 at 01:00:12: @nikitanomo 🤍🌌

2021-05-11 at 23:14:34: @TherapyMind @PsychedStudio exciting! super interested in hearing your perspective

2021-05-11 at 22:49:50: im so fuckin lucky

2021-05-11 at 22:49:15: one of my housemates is trained in pranic healing &amp; is down to help me learn!!!

another kindly answered my basic questions on buddhism yesterday &amp; we had a fun discussion on exotic states of consciousness

another kindly offered to help me plan my days &amp; battle insecurities

2021-05-11 at 22:45:22: i’m so silly

2021-05-11 at 22:45:14: was getting kind of disillusioned &amp; unhappy w housing situation but turns out my housemates are wonderful people with diverse interests &amp; talents that complement my interests &amp; talents

2021-05-11 at 22:32:05: sadhaka • siddha • sadhya • sadhan

2021-05-11 at 22:23:17: finally feel like i sorta get equanimity

our mind’s instinct is to push against pain, and to get excited and pull at any glimpse of pleasure

so equanimity is acceptance of pain &amp; pleasure rather than the push and pull

2021-05-11 at 19:40:40: they were open, they gave me a tour, their cat was named madhuri and was extremely sweet, i’m going back for a yoga class tomorrow :~)

2021-05-11 at 18:24:11: hope they’re open &amp; i hope i love it

mind blown!!!

for the longest time i just knew the “there is suffering” notion of buddhism &amp; thought that was it 😅😭

thing not pleased with -&gt; notice beginning of physical tension, “aha!”, deduce cause, redirect energy to figuring out what i can do abt thing

2021-05-05 at 23:22:45: @nickcammarata @ArtirKel cool to get some insight into why you focus on mdma - interesting you say mdma’s unparalleled in its ability to create a safe environment, could you elaborate on that?

does it have to do with emotional valence on mdma skewing positive versus unpredictable w other 5ht2a agonists?

2021-05-05 at 23:13:39: @ArtirKel @nickcammarata i’m particularly interested in thoughts surrounding psilocybin and lsd, but mdma stuff welcome too!

2021-05-05 at 23:12:13: @ArtirKel (i’m also kinda partial to in person bookstores tho. feels more serendipitous to come across books that way)

2021-05-05 at 23:11:45: @ArtirKel 🙉 sorry, what? couldn’t hear you?

2021-05-05 at 23:10:50: i’d love to be convinced otherwise!

2021-05-05 at 23:06:16: can’t shake the sense that clinical psychedelic research is just reinventing the wheel

i’d like to believe that scientific rigor applied to psychedelics would yield new insights, but it feels more like we’re finding scientific ways to describe empirically well known effects

2021-05-05 at 22:59:06: in a feat of great restraint, i stopped myself from going to the used bookstore. “i have enough to read!” i exclaimed at myself

2021-05-05 at 22:38:08: @michael_nielsen i think the visions from the goddess are legit, but i have my own biases towards mysticism &amp; spirituality

i’m currently reading “my search for ramanujan” by ken ono, who has so far alluded to being skeptical re: goddess visions too - i’ll report back on how he reconciles them!

2021-05-05 at 22:35:28: @michael_nielsen haha! yes, this was mostly a tongue in cheek response 😂

2021-05-05 at 20:19:20: planning to troubleshoot my relationships to money, consistency, and deadlines soon, and hoping to use twitter to help with this 🙃

2021-05-05 at 18:56:40: @michael_nielsen well, ramanujan was said to receive formulas and mathematical insights through dreams and visions from the goddess namagiri - i’d say that’s pretty striking!

2021-05-05 at 16:53:56: @tasshinfogleman these are all so good! 💗

2021-05-05 at 00:40:11: @harveykrishna_ synchronicity of realizations! of some sort!

2021-05-05 at 00:39:47: @harveykrishna_ today i started morning overly online and felt self getting overly revved up, then did a reset where i got back into bed &amp; did a lil 10 min focus on my breathing, then “restarted” morning w more embodied stuff!

2021-05-04 at 23:28:04: read books, drink tea, and cry kinda day

2021-05-04 at 23:25:55: @myceliummage omfg 🙂🔫

2021-05-04 at 23:22:56: @myceliummage ooh elaborate ... i am a big fan of this pipeline hehe

2021-05-04 at 21:24:46: @gracemercur i think you should do this, i for one would benefit immensely

2021-05-04 at 20:21:33: @empathy2000 but practically we r all just trying to be earnest and good and be in touch with ourselves and do good work and find ways of connecting with &amp; being there for other beings ... so however u manage to do that is good

2021-05-04 at 20:18:36: @empathy2000 there’s this distinction between *being aware of god* and *working to approach god* which is very dear to my heart

2021-05-04 at 20:17:33: @empathy2000 definitely tangential but, like, i’d always heard of enlightenment but never thought that *i* could actively seek it (enlightenment was for sadhus and monks, not me) and potentially unlock all sorts of cool stuff along the way

2021-05-04 at 20:15:45: @empathy2000 for sure! i see where you’re coming from &amp; it makes sense :)

i generally think there’s some importance to knowing that distinction exists, likely because for the longest time i didn’t know that spirituality beyond mindfulness/being at peace w yourself existed

2021-05-04 at 20:06:34: @furrukhsd 💛

2021-05-04 at 20:04:19: @empathy2000 “spiritual fitness” can def work if you mean spiritual in a secular sense lol

2021-05-04 at 20:03:58: @empathy2000 i think this framework feels generally correct &amp; i especially like the priority system in the first tweet!

just my 2c but “spiritual fitness” feels like a bit of a misnomer to me unless it involves some sort of spiritual practice (meditation, prayer etc etc)

2021-05-04 at 19:53:19: @furrukhsd hey i’m glad you feel this way, and i hope you continue to feel secure &amp; content with yourself

i do however honestly believe that romantic love has transformative capabilities that self-love alone can’t achieve

2021-05-04 at 19:48:16: (5) the absence of harmful religious beliefs, e.g. no fear of going to hell

beyond that: an appreciation for other religious faiths, &amp; the knowledge that spiritual/religious fluidity was possible

2021-05-04 at 19:38:49: yeah you can be confident and self-assured without a romantic partner, but i’ve noticed there’s a special way people who know they are romantically loved carry themselves

it’s this deep comfort with themselves, which shows in the way they hold eye contact &amp; the way they laugh

2021-05-04 at 19:35:43: after i told my parents about my first serious boyfriend, my dad sat me down and said: we’ve tried our very best to show you what real love looks like, and we trust you now to find it for yourself

this has stuck with me

2021-05-04 at 19:29:43: (4) an appreciation for the interplay of time and nature: planting bulbs in the fall &amp; watching crocuses &amp; hyacinths sprout up in the spring. spending the whole fucking summer tending to the garden &amp; seeing that continual tending would bear fruit

2021-05-04 at 19:27:29: (3) a love for plants, and the ability to identify more plants than the average person

2021-05-04 at 19:25:01: (2) the ability to write emails well, i.e. to communicate clearly, to show compassion &amp; consideration, and to be comfortable letting my voice seep through w/o sacrificing professionalism

2021-05-04 at 19:21:50: (1) instinct to formulate a “game plan” before going into challenging or novel conversations, i.e. to figure out “how can i best express what i want with incomplete knowledge of the other party”

2021-05-04 at 19:21:50: things i’m grateful my parents have imparted upon me •••

2021-05-04 at 18:59:26: thinking about how fucking proud bf’s mom must be when she thinks about her two sons — radiant, healthy, strong young men who have achieved the beginnings of professional success &amp; are well settled into loving relationships

2021-05-04 at 18:57:01: suddenly hit hard by desire to make my parents proud

2021-05-04 at 18:43:28: RT @mitdasein: https://t.co/EhBaNJT4zw

2021-05-04 at 18:34:40: thank you tension, i know you are just trying to protect me from emotional pain. thank you tension, i release you

2021-05-03 at 20:49:35: @lealeata same energy https://t.co/sAbCYuB1Er

2021-05-03 at 18:09:05: @isosteph i love everything about being a small acct except for this

2021-05-03 at 18:08:43: @isosteph :(

2021-05-03 at 15:50:02: @yolkoracle !!! exciting

2021-05-03 at 15:46:41: @yolkoracle where u goin

2021-05-02 at 22:18:05: &gt; merges onto i-5 from 580 east

“continue on i-5 for 300 miles” 😂😌

2021-05-02 at 21:10:59: thinking of moving to a new place this summer, you guys have any thoughts on berkeley versus oakland versus sf?

2021-05-02 at 07:44:13: went to a fun lil party then hung out w new friends got a lil high vaped some hemp now gonna drive home and chow :)

2021-05-02 at 02:14:08: dancing is not hard if u really listen to the music!!!

2021-05-02 at 00:10:51: @Lan_Dao_ i hope u are feeling joyous and wine drunk rn 🤍

2021-05-02 at 00:10:21: @Lan_Dao_ no it’s cute i like it

2021-05-02 at 00:09:37: @tobyshorin ✂️✂️✂️😇

2021-05-02 at 00:05:11: thinking about the big ass rocks at this desert psytrance festival and how they kept morphing &amp; looking like faces

rock • buddha head • generic face • and back again https://t.co/uifh5RRhQt

2021-05-01 at 23:27:56: @erienneyoung similar energy, from my wall! https://t.co/BxHqc19pA8

2021-05-01 at 23:15:04: this train of thought was dually catalyzed by 

(a) learning more about the dire situation in india and 

(b) starting “my search for ramanujan” &amp; reading ken ono’s experience as a nisei (first gen japanese american immigrant) against the backdrop of his dad’s youth in ww2 japan

2021-05-01 at 23:07:38: notion of homeland has distinctly feminine energy at first glance but i kno there’s masculine there too

2021-05-01 at 22:49:33: as i fold forward and exhale, may i dispel your pain

2021-05-01 at 22:47:36: as i inhale, innervating and nourishing my body, may my breath strengthen your aching chest

2021-05-01 at 22:45:03: !!!!!!! growing up is about being able to hold more and more dichotomies of yourself in superposition !!!!!!! https://t.co/W54qRTGZ61

2021-05-01 at 22:43:57: body and mind have different ways of knowing. my body knows what it means to be indian although my mind knows nothing else but being american

2021-05-01 at 22:42:45: woah starting to think about body/mind duality through a whole new lens: immigration/ancestral connection

my face and my bone structure and my skin color [body] are products of a land i feel immense mental distance   [mind] from https://t.co/49SnmTy6We

2021-05-01 at 22:39:47: this body was shaped and colored by a motherland my mind does not yet comprehend. may the movement of my body be a prayer, to replenish the energy of my body’s weary homeland

2021-05-01 at 22:32:09: as i hold my body and feel it strengthen, may i bear in my limbs even the slightest bit of your struggle, to ease your hardship

2021-05-01 at 22:19:12: as i reawaken the energy in my body, may i honor the land which bore my ancestors and thus whose vitality is my own

2021-05-01 at 22:19:12: movement as prayer ••• intention setting thread for today’s practice

2021-05-01 at 22:15:32: please don’t forget that your personal narrative is malleable

the ongoing story of “you”, past, present, and future, can be molded at will (and you have this will!)

2021-05-01 at 21:59:19: this brings up weird fractured feelings about allegiance and distance and how to feel about india, the place where my ancestors lived but that i find jarring

2021-05-01 at 21:56:38: my grandparents got covid but are fortunately mostly recovered. i know of a few people - not personally, but people who were deeply cherished by people i cherish - who weren’t as fortunate

2021-05-01 at 21:54:43: heart hurts for india. resolving to do something concrete to help (donation, prayer)

2021-05-01 at 21:49:07: @nowtheo @frankeyevee have u read it, frank? what do u think of it?

2021-05-01 at 21:48:45: @nowtheo @frankeyevee omg how did i not know of this book! i will devour anything written by shulgin, when i think about the scientist i want to be i find him deeply inspiring &amp; self-affirming

2021-05-01 at 21:47:31: @nowtheo this specific tweet was really beautifully put 🤍

2021-05-01 at 21:46:59: @nowtheo along that vein, i’d be pretty curious to hear about the “randomly experimenting” side of things. but it’s hard to decide how much you wanna reveal, esp with stigma surrounding such substances

2021-05-01 at 21:46:06: @nowtheo you thought right, thank you for sharing :)

for people who are into psychedelics, imo it’s always so interesting to hear their origin stories, i.e. how did you get into this stuff in the first place?

2021-05-01 at 21:06:17: @baymaxwell_ listenin now...

2021-05-01 at 20:56:35: @dreamingfigures @gracemercur why a moon, and not a diamond? ;)

2021-05-01 at 06:32:21: @tobyshorin good shit

2021-05-01 at 06:31:43: as much as i enjoy being fucked up there is something very special and crisp and lovely about being clear-minded on a friday night 😌

2021-04-30 at 18:15:59: @Virtual1nstinct ooh why was emergency anti lazy mode engaged?!

2021-04-30 at 01:23:11: bf gets here in 5 minutes!!!!!!!!!!!! dying of excitement 😭😭😭

2021-04-30 at 01:22:22: long distance is a pain for many reasons but nothing friggin compares to the anticipation of seeing your partner in person ☺️☺️☺️

2021-04-29 at 23:49:04: @MarcosMalakos @Virtual1nstinct @2170cell i was about to say this!

2021-04-29 at 21:47:38: time 2 go to the bakery to get cheesecake for bf’s bday tomorrow 😇

2021-04-28 at 02:56:43: @BecomingCritter dude i’ve only ever put one essay out into the world and the pride i feel on the rare occasions someone reaches out to me about it ..... incomparable

2021-04-28 at 02:55:43: RT @BecomingCritter: I really enjoy making a product that people care about

It doesn't matter if it's 10 people or 1mm, knowing that someo…

2021-04-28 at 02:12:28: @eigenrobot omg! excited for u, this was a formative teenage movie for me

2021-04-28 at 01:23:15: the only person to whom you have to demonstrate your capacity, cleverness, coolness is yourself. everyone else will follow suit

2021-04-27 at 23:56:24: @jongold i think i’m goin!

2021-04-27 at 22:06:17: @altversachi aw! sorry to hear you’re feeling fomo but glad we can commiserate with one another 🤍

i think the most important thing is how *you* feel about the place, and you seem very energetically aligned w austin rn :)

2021-04-27 at 21:55:01: this is reassuring to me. so, thanks to this anecdotal counterpoint, i continue to be excited about spending the next few - if not more - years of my life here

and i remain excited to visit my friends who end up in nyc :D

2021-04-27 at 21:55:01: however, a few in-person friends have recently found sf to be enriching &amp; are excited about staying &amp; growing their nascent (musical, cultural, intellectual) community here

2021-04-27 at 21:55:00: however, i’m not immune to social influence, so i’ve been seeing the move-to-nyc sentiment and feeling a little bummed about staying around sf

2021-04-27 at 21:55:00: why i’m not moving to nyc:

(1) i just signed off on spending ~5 years in the bay area

(2) i’m from the east coast, and i have little to no desire to return. the western us feels better for me, energetically, spiritually, intellectually, etc etc

2021-04-27 at 21:55:00: i’m excited for those who are migrating to nyc or interested in doing so, but i feel a lil bit of fomo 🙈

2021-04-27 at 21:55:00: gonna offer a small counter-point to twitter sphere nyc migration sentiments:

(let it be known that this is mostly cope)

2021-04-27 at 03:23:29: @jongold @NibiruDakini this one has been on my mind recently! curious of your takes?

2021-04-27 at 01:43:34: @embryosophy 🙆🏽‍♀️🌞🌀🌱🙏🏽

2021-04-26 at 22:25:00: i wanted to be in california *so fucking badly*

2021-04-26 at 22:23:41: lana del rey’s voice takes me back to listening to norman fucking rockwell on repeat in my beautiful little one bedroom apartment in baltimore, sorely missing bf who was across the country in california

2021-04-26 at 22:20:39: @ArtirKel but it’s ok this email i’m sending will suffice

2021-04-26 at 22:20:10: @ArtirKel i want PI to hug me and tell me it’s ok

2021-04-26 at 18:56:36: @rebrandingthing you’re not wrong but idk

a lot of *scientists* buy into “believe science”, i think this needs to be addressed

2021-04-26 at 05:10:22: starting morning pages tomorrow!

2021-04-26 at 03:35:09: @tasshinfogleman • just made a delicious, hearty dinner

• finally got into a book i started a few days ago, which i think will be very useful on a healing journey i’m embarking on

• learned some new fun yoga poses

2021-04-26 at 02:24:06: felt pretty good all day but didn’t feel *real* until i stepped outside the house and into the outside air

2021-04-26 at 02:21:51: oh yeah https://t.co/YsKQpXRWtn

2021-04-25 at 05:42:35: read the qt’d thread if ur in the mood to get deep into matilda lore

2021-04-25 at 05:40:38: wonderful man is on a week long mountaineering trip with his brother and i’m excited for them but also scared https://t.co/FLFWASNZ0W

2021-04-24 at 23:06:50: thank you all for witnessing this urge. i think i’ve decided to try listening to abbey road the whole way through (which matilda has never done before!)

2021-04-24 at 23:06:00: @anonynaut banger, i love that one

2021-04-24 at 22:58:53: hi guys, weird ask, i seem to be really enjoying the sound of dutch now? so if you have any dutch music recommendations?

2021-04-24 at 22:16:36: forever caught between “do i want to talk to someone external now?” versus “do i contain what i’m seeking so i just have to dive deeper internally?”

2021-04-24 at 21:28:54: i was an outer sunset person! today i’m embodying inner sunset person!

2021-04-24 at 20:45:59: man do i love the sunset district

2021-04-24 at 19:09:57: give in to the euphoria

2021-04-24 at 18:35:52: send fav bhajans please 🙏

2021-04-24 at 16:28:31: @harveykrishna_ you know, along a similar vein: i find it easier to think near large bodies of water .... but i mostly attribute this to my panpsychist beliefs

2021-04-24 at 10:37:35: @gracemercur ://// yeah this makes sense. even if you’re not ticking boxes per se, do you have clear next steps / do you feel you’re on a route that will unfold in a hopefully good way?

2021-04-24 at 10:22:29: @gracemercur what u think incited heightened vulnerability &amp; on what timescale have u noticed this tenderness?

2021-04-24 at 10:17:19: @liekovarpio this is the cutest thing 🥰

2021-04-24 at 10:02:30: @liekovarpio i imagine using it for discussions around a theme, and in the process getting to know u guys in a higher-resolution medium than text (i.e. voice)

iirc @eIfcup did a lil book club w spaces recently

2021-04-24 at 10:00:18: @liekovarpio i don’t have it yet, but i would like to have!

2021-04-24 at 06:03:41: when this song started i got a really strange intense feeling in my head, which passed as i interrogated it. not unsimilar to mdma come up???

2021-04-24 at 04:32:45: @NibiruDakini LOVE!!! i’ve been experiencing some spooky things in my back in the past ~two days, this feels very relevant

will try tomorrow &amp; report back

2021-04-24 at 04:30:33: y’all have any suggestions for practices that stoke the digestive fire? e.g. pranayama breaths, asanas, supplements, etc •••

2021-04-24 at 04:28:13: ah! intuition builds faster when you’re generally mindful (mindful ~= aware, observant, present)

2021-04-24 at 04:24:20: @NibiruDakini would love! whenever you get around to it 😊

2021-04-24 at 03:26:16: strong undertone of: i’m so glad i’m figuring this out, it’s gonna serve me so well &amp; my kids are gonna be so much happier, healthier, aligned, receptive right out of the gate

2021-04-24 at 03:25:18: kinda fun to recognize &amp; undo sub-optimal psychological conditioning from parents

2021-04-22 at 18:46:51: what we unearthed:
• intention to spend this summer as an exercise in expanding self-trust
• why i feel “stuck” with drugs, and how to move forward
• validation that spirituality opens u up to more spontaneous joy

2021-04-22 at 18:46:13: feeling grateful for conversations i’ve had with housemates recently, which have helped me clarify murky feelings &amp; intentions

2021-04-22 at 18:40:16: ahhh so excited to continue putting down roots in the bay area &amp; to slowly but surely find my people 💓💓💓

2021-04-22 at 03:37:05: eagerly awaiting warm cannabinoid embrace to ease accumulated stress and to make me remember that i am at my core a simple, happy human

2021-04-22 at 03:35:59: two more deliverables due tonight, after which i will be (a) taking an edible, (b) taking a nice warm shower, (c) making banana bread

2021-04-22 at 03:34:23: @natural_hazard somehow this has really stuck with me since seeing it yesterday. aspiring to do more of this myself

2021-04-21 at 23:05:21: @deepfates it’s about a psychiatrist’s [transformative, spiritual] experience w past life regression

i don’t think it’s strictly buddhist or hindu, but it aligned well with my generally hindu leaning beliefs

2021-04-21 at 23:01:40: @deepfates many lives, many masters by brian weiss 😊

2021-04-21 at 03:42:27: @cIass_man i don’t think so

malibu yes
my first drink ever was bourbon tho, that has to count for something?

2021-04-21 at 03:33:04: @cIass_man u ever drink a 90 minute dogfish head ipa in 15 minutes

2021-04-20 at 22:02:22: @Triquetrea super interesting, so basically you’re saying magnesium on the tail end of caffeine extends the stimulant effect [in a way that seems different in nature from caffeine-induced stimulation]?

2021-04-20 at 22:00:44: how does one go about making their kidneys stronger?

like certainly many medicines &amp; drugs are actively *bad* for your kidneys - how do i take care of &amp; strengthen my kidneys?

2021-04-20 at 21:53:44: @Triquetrea what’s the deal with magnesium? what effects are you noticing &amp; what’s the hypothesized mechanism?

(my knowledge is limited to: i think that when i don’t eat enough greens, i don’t have enough magnesium, and thus i get random leg muscle twitches)

2021-04-20 at 06:26:18: bit of a long shot but if you all know of any experimental fertility doctors in the bay area, i would love your recommendations

2021-04-19 at 03:07:17: first up: vantage point on bernal heights where i lost my mind for a few hours one sunday morning

2021-04-19 at 03:00:22: making pilgrimages to spots around the city where i’ve felt low, wrapping my arms around my past self and showing her how strong i am now

2021-04-19 at 00:52:30: @forshaper ooh elaborate?

2021-04-18 at 23:25:45: @embryosophy @kyosaku_jon re-committing seems to be a nascent theme for me, while meditating &amp; beyond, in any arena of my life where there is intention &amp; commitment

just saw it (re-committing) in this reply and wanted to hop on w my two cents ☺️💗

2021-04-18 at 23:22:29: living in sf means i get to be a mere 15 min drive from the beach but that the beach is habitable only about 15 days out of the year

2021-04-18 at 22:43:05: worth noting that my emotional volatility went 📉📉📉 and has stayed as such ever since my first psychedelic experience

2021-04-18 at 22:41:35: having an excellent time on the beach rn. lying on belly soaking in sun, toes in the sand, journaling &amp; reflecting on the past few weeks, listening to hanuman chalisa

2021-04-18 at 22:05:52: (step 5.1) as i parked on 48th street, the sun finally came out ☀️☀️☀️ and i was doubly happy to see it :)

2021-04-18 at 22:04:41: (step 5) en route to the beach, i noticed how cloudy the sky was. i was disappointed because i wanted to spend the afternoon soaking in sun @ a warm beach. but i made peace with the clouds &amp; resolved to have a good (even if cold) time regardless

2021-04-18 at 22:02:53: (step 4) i packed a bag and got into my car to head over to the beach. driving my car felt unexpectedly amazing! 

related: i remembered a book i’m reading, which says that as you become more ~spiritual, you begin to notice more instants of spontaneous joy

2021-04-18 at 22:00:30: (step 3) i had two — wait, three! — pleasant conversations with housemates, and remembered that when i am sweet &amp; pleasant &amp; joyous, other people reflect that back to me. 

my home is a kind place! the world is a kind place!

2021-04-18 at 21:58:52: (step 2) i did seven rounds of sun salutation and felt the strength of my body, as it supported itself

2021-04-18 at 21:58:07: (step 1) i made cacao and drank it in the sun, and from seemingly nowhere sprang the desire to hug my housemates and to hold them in my love

2021-04-18 at 20:27:01: today i am on a quest to recover my vitality

2021-04-18 at 20:26:06: @tasshinfogleman i can’t express just how “here for this” i am

2021-04-18 at 20:25:08: @altversachi i knew you’d have an answer to this one! thank you :)

2021-04-18 at 19:38:33: ayurvedic q: does a person’s vata / kapha / pitta constitution stay constant over time? 

if they do vary, does relative constitution (e.g. vata dominance) stay the same, or could one transition from being, say, vata dominant to pitta dominant?

2021-04-18 at 19:34:38: i want to know more yoga sequences

2021-04-18 at 19:34:09: nothing stopping me from banging out seven rounds of sun salutation right now

2021-04-18 at 18:14:01: how to be compassionate towards those you’ve grown past?

2021-04-17 at 21:27:07: i mean lavender as an addition for flavor/fragrance, not just lavender

2021-04-17 at 21:26:29: has anyone tried rolling lavender into a joint, or can you think of a reason why this would obviously be a bad idea?

2021-04-17 at 20:22:30: @sokindling my mom has an excellent sense of direction, my dad not so much

my sense of direction is quite bad (except for cardinal directions), whereas my sibling has had an excellent sense of direction basically since he exited the womb

2021-04-17 at 20:21:20: @sokindling i swear sense of direction is at least slightly genetic

2021-04-17 at 17:58:44: @sonyasupposedly see u there! 😎😊

q2: if you could have any job, what’d it be?

2021-04-17 at 00:55:33: @ArtirKel yeah this is my feeling! gonna dive deep these next 5 years 🤿

2021-04-17 at 00:29:50: @forshaper (2.1) i aspire towards the sort of deep understanding he has, but for biology. the path towards this type of knowing is unclear because of (1)

2021-04-17 at 00:28:17: @forshaper (2) there are a few teachers i admire for their unconventional teaching methods, e.g. ali hajimiri’s circuits lectures. he teaches concepts in an order &amp; fashion few other people do, and in a way that shows his deep understanding of the topic

2021-04-17 at 00:25:57: @forshaper (1) the way biology is conventionally taught doesn’t sit well with me: largely memorization, concepts that aren’t tractable &amp; traceable in the same way as physics (where you start from ~one set of equations and can derive the rest)

2021-04-17 at 00:25:18: @forshaper not quite. let me try to explain what i mean:

2021-04-17 at 00:12:48: i don’t know what learning biology in a principled manner looks like but i am betting that i will know it when i see it (experience it)

2021-04-17 at 00:02:02: are any of you reiki fiends

2021-04-16 at 23:32:40: RT @embryosophy: this could be us but u playin

2021-04-16 at 23:19:56: i might be misinterpreting this, but shivoham sounds like shiv (shiva) • ham (me/us), which as a compound phrase i think invokes shiva’s presence within us

2021-04-15 at 23:38:32: well guys looks like this is the last ~2 week slog of work before i take the summer off!

2021-04-15 at 19:52:06: am learning to appreciate people for who they are

2021-04-15 at 13:44:47: @liekovarpio maybe a new frame, otherwise just validation: it’s significant when *you* say things, even if they’re things everyone knows

when *you* say a thing, you become an advocate for that belief

i take things more seriously when my friends say them!

2021-04-09 at 19:59:40: @youarezera hm, would you say research masters doesn’t exist in US? i wonder why that’s the case?

2021-04-09 at 19:58:55: @youarezera yeah huh imo research assistantship/lab tech work is way better than masters if you’re gonna do something academic between undergrad and phd

2021-04-09 at 19:55:57: @youarezera for this reason i never considered getting a masters en route to phd

i think it may be different in other countries? bf was funded (category (1) i think) doing masters in canada &amp; i think you are paid in europe too?

2021-04-09 at 19:44:49: @gigafelon oh huh i forgot about how many places do pay for a master’s! i’d say that falls closer to (2)

2021-04-09 at 19:40:36: i’ve long thought the vast majority (&gt;80%) fall into category (3) but i’m not sure

2021-04-09 at 19:39:59: do any of you know what proportion of master’s programs in the US are:

(1) funded (you get paid, like a phd) 
(2) funded (your tuition is covered, you break even)
(3) paid for by you (you gotta pay tuition)

2021-04-09 at 18:26:33: on a much larger time scale, our dietary/lifestyle/environmental/etc choices will affect us years down the line, and likely even our offspring via ~epigenetics~

but that’s hard to parse

we might actually be able to figure out mechanisms when delayed effects are a few days out

2021-04-09 at 18:23:23: a thing that is interesting/freaky to me is delayed physiological effects, on the time scale of days, e.g.

• feeling terrible +2 days after taking mdma
• headache +4 days after second vaccine dose
• cell death +3 days post electroporation &amp; treatment

nope, not pregnant. my theory is some sort of stagnant energy coupled with dehydration, maybe

whereas biology (and to a certain extent chem) are non linear

2021-04-06 at 21:06:21: one of my housemates TA’s a different undergrad math course each quarter and i am so inspired by his enthusiasm, e.g.

• “but wait — here’s the Big Twist...”
• “great question... [thoughtful pause] so here’s the intuition, you can think about this sphere as...”

2021-04-06 at 20:58:53: i am beginning to think that yoga is a search for experiential truth ••• the search for intellectual truth by itself doesn’t feel like enough, to me

2021-04-06 at 18:48:01: @empathy2000 (i am surprisingly good at presentations and i think i owe it to my parents forcing me to do an oratorical competition in 3rd grade)

2021-04-06 at 18:46:07: @empathy2000 oooh i was just thinking yesterday there r a few topics i wanna learn more abt and one way i’d enjoy synthesizing info is giving presentations/lectures to [interested] friends

2021-04-06 at 18:12:18: i mean, okay, if you insist https://t.co/ZhF1ltW2zY

2021-04-06 at 15:42:37: i personally think that the spiritual side is far more magical and fun

but i’m glad that people who err towards the other side of the spectrum can get value out of meditation etc too

2021-04-06 at 15:41:43: i guess i appreciate that mindfulness/mediation can be made either as spiritual or as secular as you want them to be

2021-04-06 at 03:41:14: @BLUNDERBUSSTED ☺️🤍

2021-04-06 at 02:43:25: @BLUNDERBUSSTED got very good use out of these tweet (felt like a meme hand-crafted for bf) https://t.co/8puvha5xUz

2021-04-06 at 01:59:48: @FrankMe123 that will almost certainly mess it up, but issok. maybe some exciting algorithmic synergy will occur. you like your sister’s taste in music?

2021-04-06 at 01:58:09: great, close to everything i need! https://t.co/wVuC1BlXLA

2021-04-06 at 01:34:34: big fan of leaving work while it’s still light out!

2021-04-05 at 23:54:16: extremely pleased with how good my discover weekly has gotten, spotify keeps feeding me extraordinarily groovy beats and sonically interesting compositions

2021-04-05 at 23:06:41: @adjacentgrace !!!

2021-04-05 at 23:02:34: @embryosophy oh this is reassuring, especially the notion of immune activation as wooziness (new to me, but feels correct) 🤍

2021-04-05 at 22:50:25: lmao https://t.co/0QXS4KXDGe

2021-04-05 at 22:49:32: every day in service of becoming more sensitive, more tender, more mortal and immortal at once

2021-04-05 at 22:46:11: these past few months of living with 8 other people have been infinitely more formative than the year i spent living by myself

2021-04-05 at 22:43:34: feeling cognitively altered post second dose, i.e. unusually spacey and kinda foggy. unsure if real or imagined lol

2021-04-05 at 19:56:52: @liekovarpio pls!

2021-04-03 at 20:34:06: @chercher_ai @eggprophet u must acquire pink pantaloons as well

2021-04-03 at 20:31:21: @tasshinfogleman ooh! morning pages like from the artist’s way?

2021-04-03 at 20:30:45: went on a lil walk in the neighborhood with mom and she identified 5 plants whose identity i had been wondering about 😊

lila • “divine play” in sanskrit
expt • shorthand i use in my lab notebook for “experiment”

divine play experiment coming at u live from san francisco 😎

2021-04-02 at 18:14:42: @rmpars god i’ve been imagining a rapturous moment when i run to the ocean and greet her rising waves, and in that moment collectively revel in the marvel of existence &amp; consciousness

2021-04-02 at 18:07:49: @startuployalist reminded of this snippet from @celinehalioua’s operating principles, and so very happy for you https://t.co/Rmv4bbVZVP

2021-04-02 at 18:03:23: it is my responsibility to recognize, honor, and cherish every granule of consciousness, blossoming by virtue of its existence

2021-04-02 at 18:00:00: @startuployalist oh heck yeah! 💛

2021-04-02 at 17:45:04: @isosteph hahaha i mean it! ☺️

2021-04-02 at 17:23:11: @isosteph steph not to get existential but it seems that you are living life intensely and honestly, and i think that is an excellent outcome

2021-04-02 at 17:16:03: @FrankMe123 what science podcasts do u listen to - i can recommend more fun ones to listen to, possibly!

2021-04-02 at 17:11:04: @eggprophet dude when u used the phrase “mental ecology” in a reply that was the first time i’d seen it &amp; i’ve used it extensively since then. all my irl homies think i’m smart or something 😎

2021-04-02 at 17:02:45: as krishnamurti says, to be religious is to be sensitive to reality 💗

2021-04-02 at 17:00:20: literally tearing up thinking about how i get to show them the life i’ve started to build for myself here. lil matilda is doing just fine in the big world

2021-04-02 at 16:58:10: @lalaAlicelala :((( hoping it turns up in an unexpected and joyous way

2021-04-01 at 02:31:19: @gregbglw i LOVE DEVA PREMAL

2021-04-01 at 02:27:29: @disconcerta hell yeah! you doing anything with your parents anytime soon?

2021-04-01 at 02:12:02: rolling pretty hard rn, would love any good vibes, questions to ponder, or exciting things from your life :)

2021-03-31 at 22:40:19: here’s mine:

• women’s multivitamin when i remember (general)
• vit D when i remember (general)
• evening primrose oil caps here n there (hormonal)
• hawthorn tea here n there (heart)

definitely room for improvement lol

2021-03-31 at 22:35:13: okay i want to hear about your supplement regimes

2021-03-31 at 22:27:18: in the supplement aisle at rite-aid, it’s pretty crazy all the different sorts of stuff you can get! — papaya enzyme, milk thistle extract, oregano oil, black cohosh extract •••

2021-03-31 at 21:05:12: spent last weekend in the desert, now my mental terrain looks just like this (not complaining) https://t.co/wQJFgauIQJ

2021-03-31 at 18:58:01: i am sensing it is time to return to reading pihkal (i first picked it up a few months ago)

2021-03-31 at 17:54:24: @kyosaku_jon 😄😇

2021-03-31 at 17:29:33: @kyosaku_jon waiting for this to happen to me, i’ll let you know when this sort of appreciation sets in (~1 year in and we’re not there yet)

2021-03-31 at 17:27:44: don’t mind me just running to the store for some vitamin e and 5-htp

2021-03-31 at 05:04:01: @BLUNDERBUSSTED u have any novels in particular you wanna read?

2021-03-30 at 19:43:33: @architectonyx @InquilineKea @nickcammarata i’d agree with that guess! the experiences i’ve heard about are from san pedro tea. 

i’m planning to try a proper dose of san pedro tea sometime in the next few months, haven’t quite figured out set/setting yet, but eager to experience

2021-03-30 at 18:12:54: @nickcammarata fair

2021-03-30 at 18:12:19: @architectonyx @InquilineKea @nickcammarata hmm! this is interesting. 

i've heard low doses extracted from san pedro can skew towards a negative experience - confusion, nausea, anxiety, etc. it seems almost as if there's a threshold dosage you have to break through. curious if this aligns or diverges with your experience?

2021-03-30 at 18:09:31: @nickcammarata ceremonial cacao kinda like this no?

2021-03-29 at 19:42:15: how to intentionally cultivate humility?

2021-03-25 at 21:41:55: @empathy2000 i love it, thank you so much! captures immensity &amp; infinity, and “nerve nets” has a nice lil science flair i like :~)

2021-03-25 at 21:23:20: @liekovarpio @temeton_blue may i also humbly request a laboratory to do some experiments for the sake of scientific progress?

happy to take on apprentices

2021-03-25 at 21:22:04: @liekovarpio @temeton_blue hehe i accept the call to duty 🤙

2021-03-25 at 21:10:04: @blisstweeting anger kinda freaks me out! like, dissociation &amp; oblivion are fine by me, but being fully in my body and having anger cloud my brain...

2021-03-25 at 21:07:20: @blisstweeting woah! how do you induce the state? this is an interesting concept

2021-03-25 at 20:58:29: smart capable engineer bf smart capable engineer gf

2021-03-25 at 19:57:06: sometimes i lapse and feel righteous anger (scary feeling). but peace is always within reach

2021-03-25 at 19:56:04: highly recommend being generally good-natured and even-tempered. makes life better for everyone, especially you

2021-03-25 at 01:52:23: be good to every unit of consciousness which comprises you

2021-03-25 at 01:27:07: @densityexpert extremely valid. i think portability would be nice, saxophone seems a biiit big, but worth looking into

2021-03-25 at 01:26:32: okay also i don’t feel a draw to flute at all so let’s rule that out

2021-03-25 at 01:12:13: pls don’t say singing, i kno that involves mastery of breath but i’m asking for a physical instrument

2021-03-25 at 01:11:38: let’s say i wanted to learn a woodwind instrument, or more generally an instrument which involves mastery of breath — what would you guys suggest?

based on vibe, preference, personal experience, anything

2021-03-24 at 18:24:02: @marialambert • towards because the few deeply spiritual friends i have, have had an incredible impact on me. so why not have more of that! also, was reading a book which mentioned the “refining power of spiritual community” and i was like 🤔 that sounds very good

2021-03-24 at 18:21:52: @marialambert • away because when i’ve joined community meetings or events, i don’t feel like i belong. somehow i also feel that in joining a community with established beliefs, i lose some of the magic of my mostly solitary spiritual journey thus far

2021-03-24 at 18:10:35: @marialambert hey there thanks for asking! i feel a pull in both directions:

2021-03-24 at 18:04:50: again, seeking inspiration to live earnestly towards alignment with god

2021-03-23 at 02:04:05: i am beginning to wrestle with the notion of spiritual community, and what place it should have in my life

2021-03-23 at 01:58:27: @lalaAlicelala dude ipas are just constant assault on tastebuds... i’m in the mood for them like once in a blue moon but much more often in the mood for a blue moon 🤣

2021-03-22 at 23:39:09: @gptbr00ke i know it’s hard but i’m sending u the strength to keep growing it out ⚡️

2021-03-22 at 20:53:06: reflecting on my schooling: small class size &amp; conscious cultivation of a group dynamic are both underrated things

2021-03-22 at 20:05:50: @empathy2000 i haven’t seen these (i refuse to get tiktok, i only consume secondhand) can u link an example

2021-03-22 at 19:06:52: @gregbglw so exciting! what do you feel called towards — the mountains, the sunshine, the snow, a certain sentiment or sense unique to one of those places?

2021-03-22 at 18:00:45: this fine morning i’m walking over to my favorite grassy patch in potrero hill to read one chapter each from my two current favorite books 😊

2021-03-21 at 22:55:49: @myceliummage @EggProphet haha this is a good one, bf makes fun of my pinned tweet on the reg &amp; i think he would appreciate this

2021-03-21 at 21:35:12: i think a good default orientation is one of reverence, towards 8 year olds and 22 year olds and 81 year olds alike. everyone deserves to have their gaze held, their full being considered

2021-03-21 at 21:21:46: condescension makes me unusually upset, in that very rarely do things upset me

2021-03-21 at 20:29:15: i have fallen in love with you slowly, with the quiet inevitability of a flower bud forming, changing color, and bursting into bloom

2021-03-21 at 20:26:20: every age is such a precious age to be

2021-03-21 at 19:55:19: @EggProphet @myceliummage yuh

2021-03-21 at 02:05:16: kinda scared posting anything even meta political bc i don’t want to call in political energy into this account — i have genuine curiosity about QT &amp; so i’ll see how it is received 🙏 https://t.co/88xPD5TLBo

2021-03-21 at 01:56:59: @cognazor hard agree

2021-03-21 at 01:15:59: @moothought incredible 😂🤩

2021-03-21 at 01:15:14: @lowqualitybot sending you love 💗

2021-03-21 at 00:03:18: conflicted:

on one hand i think being informed &amp; prepared is super important

on the other hand i think there’s value in leaning into the spontaneity &amp; irresponsibility of drug usage, and finding who you are — who you want to be — in the process https://t.co/b2F6EKLYOE

2021-03-20 at 23:49:20: @nowtheo ☺️🥰🥰🥰 i was scared of coming across as preachy, i’m glad what i said resonated :)

2021-03-20 at 23:48:08: @nowtheo i don’t have any concrete ideas but i do know generally that any sort of powerful feeling can make me wanna cry. so i guess instead of optimizing for crying induction go for relating as honestly &amp; deeply as you can and see what follows?

idk idk just spitballing u kno

2021-03-20 at 23:19:50: @BLUNDERBUSSTED bf and i love imitating passerbys’ accents &amp; phrases as soon as they are out of earshot

2021-03-20 at 23:12:24: generally i think people (especially young people) who are inclined to be activists have a good deal of inner work they should attend to first

if you’ve got that deep sort of love, the urge towards activism follows

2021-03-20 at 23:10:36: activism is easy but good activism (compassionate, motivated by a deep sort of love, willingness to *meet people where they are*) is hard

2021-03-20 at 23:01:20: how did you liberate yourself from political polarization?

2021-03-20 at 22:50:08: @embryosophy just leaned down and got poked by this pointy tip and my gut response was very much of the is this 🦋 flirting variety https://t.co/MlcdLpRyfV

2021-03-20 at 20:27:28: @nowtheo also worth noting the potential for non linear actualization of potential: something serendipitous could happen &amp; things suddenly begin falling into place

2021-03-20 at 20:25:06: @nowtheo (i’ve heard your thirties are just like your twenties except you have more money &amp; more things figured out. your body will still be healthy and strong. your potential isn’t going anywhere :-) )

2021-03-20 at 20:23:19: @nowtheo kinda wondering if there’s an interpersonal trigger for crying, i.e. could you get on a call with a friend and do something that would reliably trigger cathartic release / crying

2021-03-20 at 20:20:43: @nowtheo ☺️☺️☺️

i guess before giving any advice, i’d wanna know if the gloominess you’ve mentioned in the first tweet has persisted, and to what extent

often w uncertainty there isn’t that much we can actually *do* about it aside from try to revel in it

2021-03-20 at 20:12:15: @Triquetrea all this makes complete sense to me, you did a great job of conveying the nature of your aesthetics-level read :)

2021-03-20 at 20:10:29: @adjacentgrace ok cool now i want to move to LA tomorrow

2021-03-20 at 19:41:32: @nowtheo u have the right intuition here re: seeking constraint, you end up doing it?

2021-03-20 at 19:26:35: @Triquetrea woah this is an interesting take, what made you think of this? — reading a specific book, noticing a sufi teaching come to life in your daily experience, etc?

2021-03-20 at 08:39:30: directed towards me — “when i think of ‘degenerate’, i think of you!”

2021-03-19 at 19:32:52: dissociation can be Great, Actually

2021-03-19 at 19:31:27: earlier today, in a video call with a new friend, i found myself so deeply present in the conversation that when speaking, the sound of my own voice was unfamiliar

i was surprised at the superposition of earnestness and levity my voice carried

2021-03-19 at 19:27:39: @adjacentgrace could you elaborate a little? which plant gets which grace?

2021-03-19 at 19:27:04: @adjacentgrace love this unearthing of implicit behavior hehe

2021-03-19 at 19:22:04: for those of you with house plants, do you ascribe personalities to each or certain plants?

2021-03-19 at 18:18:45: @BecomingCritter woah

2021-03-19 at 18:14:57: @BecomingCritter my dear critter what does this mean

2021-03-19 at 07:09:43: @BLUNDERBUSSTED that being said yea it’s less than ideal

2021-03-19 at 07:09:12: @BLUNDERBUSSTED it’s not so bad sleeping alone when you know the person you love is falling asleep thinking of you too

2021-03-19 at 07:04:57: @moothought save your tears is an eternal classic in the making

2021-03-19 at 07:04:16: @moothought one day i want to be high out of my mind, staring either up at LA or down at it from a distance, and absolutely lose my shit when blinding lights comes on

2021-03-19 at 07:00:10: i spent a year yearning for california and those albums gave me a taste i kept returning to

would you say ontario and east coast us have notably different vibes &amp; what would u attribute any diffs to?

2021-03-18 at 01:55:02: unconvinced of the value of music critics ... like it’s okay if u didn’t vibe w the album, but just say that instead of turning your aesthetic distaste into a quality judgement

2021-03-17 at 23:19:26: if you’re feeling ‘meh’ about your wardrobe: consider getting a few new pieces, ideally unusual or patterned, to inject life into your wardrobe

(or if you’ve got too many patterns going on by default, get some nice plain colors for contrast &amp; flavor)

2021-03-14 at 16:29:54: @dendricide @nickcammarata @DhashS i appreciate this levity. 

my sense: i think, after a taste of losing yourself, people learn to lose themselves in more interesting &amp; personally suited ways. it’s just like, how do you lose yourself to re-find yourself? for me, it’s x, and for you, it’s x + y

2021-03-14 at 12:57:02: plants are really good at figuring out how to make colors happen (thinking a lot about purple)

2021-03-14 at 12:46:27: @liekovarpio @shivanipand here’s the purple, which exists in superposition with the white version across the city this march! idk what it’s even called! leaves have a nice scent when u rub btwn fingers https://t.co/JzkGaF1ipY

2021-03-14 at 12:44:40: @kehwho i think u would vibe in this regard with hitomi mochizuki who makes videos on youtube — i’ll return and link a vid or two when i remember

2021-03-14 at 12:43:33: @kehwho thank u for showing me that sexuality &amp; sensuality is a thing that can be inhabited in a spiritually deep way

2021-03-14 at 12:38:36: @liekovarpio @shivanipand it’s exactly as soft as it looks and guess what — at some point, it turns purple!!!

2021-03-14 at 12:37:49: @liekovarpio @shivanipand liekkiö i found a plant i really vibe with &amp; i wanted to let u kno https://t.co/EkpTGPlKk0

2021-03-14 at 10:43:53: maybe this is a good idea for deepening twitter relationships: let’s hang out in person or on a call and vibe out on what makes you who you are

2021-03-14 at 10:42:59: walking through my instagram with a new friend, this is a really excellent *acquainting you with ((who i am))* activity

2021-03-14 at 10:36:36: @goblinodds goooooobbs! this is too good!

2021-03-14 at 10:20:41: @liekovarpio those dogs are cute as HELL can u drop some more dog &amp; home photos below this

2021-03-14 at 10:13:35: before i leave sf wanna make a physical scrap book of the people who are here right now, who i know — like a yearbook, but for right here &amp; now, spring 2021 as the city wakes back up

2021-03-14 at 10:05:46: @temeton_blue @liekovarpio *as in a blurry mirror* is a really excellent way of expressing that sensation

2021-03-14 at 10:03:52: @liekovarpio ohhhhh gosh! that sounds incredibly pleasant — what things are you making sure to do on this vacation (reading a book, going to the lake, making a certain meal, etc etc)?

2021-03-14 at 09:53:04: i’m building the walkways of japanese gardens now in the way i write &amp; attempt to express myself: know when to center yourself &amp; when to center their response

2021-03-14 at 09:51:24: ❄️🌞❄️🌞❄️🌞🌞❄️🌞❄️🌞❄️

2021-03-14 at 09:50:46: i like that in my home i don’t feel affected by the sexual undertones of most mixed gender situations, 

it’s like we trust each other to set boundaries &amp; 

i get the sense that most people don’t have a sense of their boundaries: a willingness to set and break and reset

2021-03-14 at 09:43:26: guys interact with this tweet with an interaction that fits your vibe (meme response, rhetorical repsonse, emojis, liking, rt’ing, even just ‘!!!’ is a valid vibe)

2021-03-14 at 09:40:00: i feel like you might have gone to sleep early tonight, in a responsible way, like with the intentionality of getting a good sleep for tomorrow

2021-03-14 at 09:37:58: also hi @erienneyoung, who is a seasoned viber 🙇🏽‍♀️🙇🏽‍♀️🙇🏽‍♀️

2021-03-14 at 09:31:40: guys, gattaca *is* my life — what!

2021-03-14 at 09:30:11: pretty cool that i get to work in crispr adjacent research, and get paid to think about literally modifying DNA, i bet DNA didn’t think we’d ever be able to effect it

2021-03-14 at 09:19:04: @gracemercur ✨🙆🏽‍♀️✨

2021-03-14 at 09:15:34: @gracemercur okay okay okay doing this now

2021-03-14 at 09:15:09: i think in life we are slowly figuring out who we *always* are ••• finding who you are, always is a task worth undertaking

2021-03-14 at 09:05:47: gonna start signing off letters with

always,
matilda

when i convey something that reflects who i always am

2021-03-14 at 09:02:38: (or if *they’re* otherworldly show that ur safe and at home, always)

2021-03-14 at 09:00:55: @gracemercur i really enjoy this layer of interwoven digital lives (twitter dot com)

2021-03-14 at 08:57:38: @gracemercur i mean this in a real physical world, being in a crowd that you run with, to know what it means to *run with* a crowd, when you run /with/ you have their strength &amp; confidence but at the end of the day you only really run with yourself

2021-03-14 at 08:54:21: @gracemercur i think i’ve figured out how to vibe in the past few months, and what it took was finding my crowd — helped me understand my vibe and how to nurture it

2021-03-14 at 08:51:37: @gracemercur @willlowthewhisp aw yeah strength 💪🏽 and snow ❄️

2021-03-14 at 08:49:32: how to ward off unfriendly vibing masculine energy: be ☀️otherworldly☀️ and float off to your own dimension 🌞🌞🌞

2021-03-14 at 08:45:43: @gracemercur i think @willlowthewhisp has some really good thoughts on vulnerability and setting boundaries with how vulnerable you are with different people, which is a layer of intentionality that is important

2021-03-14 at 08:44:14: @gracemercur yeah, maximizing the *getting vulnerable* angle rather than the *becoming more empathetic* angle

2021-03-14 at 08:42:14: RT @moothought: @gracemercur I don't have advice, but my thought is; that one has to let go of self, in order to let the other in.

2021-03-14 at 08:41:58: @gracemercur do you have the opportunity to be vulnerable around people? ••• i think if you actively open the space to be vulnerable &amp; your capacity to handle that, i think that’s a good starting point

2021-03-14 at 08:39:29: @liekovarpio i want visual of bicep fist pumping 💪👊

2021-03-14 at 08:36:44: figuring out the flavors of absurdity rn and they’re delicious

2021-03-14 at 08:28:29: why is there no fist pumping emoji 😔

2021-03-14 at 08:27:54: aw fuk yeah, fist pumping with the yes crowd but head also thinking about the jumping out of a plane with my body think with the no crowd

2021-03-14 at 08:16:34: really think about this one: would u go sky diving

2021-03-14 at 08:09:56: very cool to be hanging out with people and to be able to ✨see✨ us vibing

2021-03-12 at 19:17:59: @BeetSamantha @Virtual1nstinct yes, absolutely! 

here is the chapter i was reading about them if you'd like to take a look :)

https://t.co/EyRfS3lz3r

2021-03-12 at 19:09:12: @BeetSamantha @Virtual1nstinct the rarámuri people of chihuahua would agree with you

they view plants as humans &amp; in their origin stories describe plants who have taken human form and vice versa

2021-03-12 at 18:07:50: @harveykrishna_ bf’s grandfather sat down and recorded his life story before his passing, and now it exists on a series of cassettes. got crazy chills listening to it

2021-03-12 at 06:27:18: @Probably_Brian lesgooooo

2021-03-12 at 00:32:00: @moothought wait lemme just grab my keys i’ll come with you!

2021-03-12 at 00:28:54: yea novelty is great but have u tried infinity

2021-03-12 at 00:24:33: maybe growing up is about being able to hold more and more dichotomies of yourself in superposition

e.g. right now i feel simultaneously the oldest &amp; most independent i ever have AND also very in touch with my young, easily excitable and easily scared inner kid

2021-03-12 at 00:16:58: listening to 90s trance 
dancing at standing desk 
doing epigenetics hw 
drinking ginger chai

2021-03-12 at 00:15:07: @chercher_ai ha i dunno if “think” is even the right verb, many of these things i don’t “think” about, at least not in a strictly intellectual way

2021-03-12 at 00:13:43: @chercher_ai if you are able to put it into words, how do you think about this w/o middleman concept?

2021-03-12 at 00:11:45: [the things i want] are not always what should happen, i am limited by my perceptual horizon &amp; the ways in which my mind is not free yet. but that’s ok. i am looked after

2021-03-12 at 00:09:10: striking a balance between [surrendering, letting the universe lead me] and [pushing, actively making real the things i want]

2021-03-11 at 21:58:30: @tasshinfogleman amaaazing! lookin forward to reading &amp; listening :)

2021-03-11 at 21:08:38: @tasshinfogleman could you share a link or title?

2021-03-11 at 20:25:46: @chercher_ai omg do you know how long he’ll be on for? want to watch rn but have meetings 😭

2021-03-11 at 20:07:44: @gracemercur i’ve been really excited to answer this question but i keep putting it off 😆🙈

2021-03-11 at 03:32:00: @BecomingCritter this is cursed

2021-03-11 at 02:12:15: i cut my long hair a few weeks ago. it’s barely even chin length now, and i oscillate between liking it and deeply regretting it every other day

i have an obscene amount of self-confidence &amp; self-love but i can’t shake the feeling of missing the weight &amp; femininity of long hair

2021-03-11 at 02:03:38: @adjacentgrace she is beautiful! are those blue eyes i see?!

2021-03-11 at 02:02:59: @adjacentgrace oh my God what a Fluffy belly

2021-03-09 at 23:22:03: as an addendum to (1), i’m reminded of ram dass describing scientists trying to study his guru neem karoli baba: like an ant trying to study an elephant

2021-03-09 at 23:20:11: i genuinely believe that (1) there is only so far that science can go, in explaining phenomena and as a sense-making tool

but also that (2) i have yet to fully explore how far science can go. that’s what these next few years of training are for

2021-03-09 at 19:45:50: @_holyweather does dis work https://t.co/HIVFKso0kS

2021-03-09 at 05:26:16: this kind of spooked me - a few days ago i was writing about fear &amp; curiosity surrounding moving to LA, and my desire to (a) deeply understand LA, and (b) explore how humans *relate to where they live*

i didn’t really know where to start with (b)... til i came across this book!

2021-03-09 at 05:26:16: • was a lovely chapter on the rarámuri people of mexico
• chapter concluded with statement on acknowledging our (human) *relationship to the place we live*

2021-03-09 at 05:26:16: tidbit of synchronicity from my day today: 

• went for walk at sunset
• passed a lil free library, sifted through books &amp; found one on ~indigenous relationships to nature
• chose a chapter to read from table of contents, while flipping to it another chapter caught my eye https://t.co/NWpbBKd08F

2021-03-09 at 05:13:42: @gracemercur !! this is pretty friggin cool

a couple questions: (1) how long did it take, (2) how did you know how much to dose yourself with - (2.1) did you base your approach off of any existing protocols or did you come up w your own approach or both?

2021-03-09 at 05:09:46: do you personally know any adult survivors of pediatric cancer?

realizing i don’t know any personally &amp; i think i would like to connect with others who’ve been through it

2021-03-08 at 02:05:11: from a talk i was listening to earlier, the three things a spiritual aspirant needs:

(1) complete surrender [to a teacher]
(2) a strong desire for liberation
(3) infinite patience

and what a ride it’s been: finding my voice again and again; growing &amp; sharing my joy, deep pain, insights; and making a home for myself in this lil pocket of the internet 🥰

2021-03-04 at 08:07:12: my cat feels like a japanese grandfather https://t.co/RfiYdNXn4N

2021-03-04 at 05:51:26: @disconcerta unsolicited advice - could try sleeping with mouthguard to help with clenched jaw

2021-03-04 at 03:28:55: @startingfromnix yay!! i hope you enjoy it :)

2021-03-04 at 02:47:46: @startingfromnix here’s a simple yoga sequence that does an excellent job of drawing attention to the different sensations in your body

https://t.co/L8bJrjJMfj

2021-03-04 at 02:46:23: @startingfromnix you could consider trying yoga instead of meditation - you’re bringing awareness &amp; energy to your body in a way that’s a little more engaging

(in some hindu spiritual traditions getting good at yoga is a precursor to being able to be good at meditation)

2021-03-04 at 02:41:08: @altversachi hehe i guess so! 😈😌

2021-03-04 at 02:39:35: @tjrwriting (sorry if i’m misunderstanding something simple here!)

2021-03-04 at 02:39:09: @tjrwriting just want to clarify this first tweet

do you mean that until age 25 you can rely on optionality, if you’re doing something that inherently has optionality (CS major, FAANG job, etc)?

+ if so, why can’t you rely on optionality for perpetuity?

2021-03-04 at 02:34:59: @altversachi u mean blog posts you’re gonna write or blog posts by other people demystifying the field ... or both?!

2021-03-04 at 02:33:34: i love when you pull a word out of thin air whose definition you aren’t quite sure of

but then you look it up &amp; the meaning &amp; connotations are perfect

feels like a clear indicator that our memories are far richer than what’s accessible at surface level

2021-03-04 at 01:48:51: @sadalsvvd it looks incredible i’ll get started later tonight

2021-03-04 at 01:45:13: @sadalsvvd dude i was just imagining something like this earlier today 

either AR/VR overlay of different sets of room decor onto my current bedroom

or like, a 3D moodboard (which this kinda totally is)

2021-03-03 at 21:22:20: might unironically, finally get into tumblr

2021-03-03 at 21:13:27: @almostnora putting these on my moving-to-LA moodboard, thank u

2021-03-03 at 07:38:38: @_holyweather full faith ☺️

2021-03-03 at 02:41:47: good day at work bouncing around some science ideas, planned for upcoming escapades in nature, went to trader joe’s, 

now heading home and gonna hang out w housemates, mess around on ableton, have a call with a new friend, and watch a movie with bf

good friggin day

2021-03-03 at 01:21:04: @Thinkwert how did he get stuck in the sand?! @Virtual1nstinct https://t.co/26qNSiJ2Oi

2021-03-03 at 01:20:07: @Thinkwert poor turtle!!!

2021-03-03 at 00:28:18: @Virtual1nstinct aw i listened to a couple episodes, didn’t make it through the whole bible but would love to return to it in the future

the podcast itself is a really nice idea

2021-03-02 at 22:45:22: @AClockwork_Crow you know, i’m not sure

i just got really tired of trying to book campsites &amp; everything being booked, plus booking in advance isn’t conducive to my desire for spontaneity

2021-03-02 at 22:37:19: it took me two days of obsessively perusing reddit and various personal blogs

but now i am kind of an expert on finding sites for dispersed camping (aka free, no-need-to-reserve) in california

2021-03-02 at 22:19:50: spring and fall are interchangeably tuesday and thursday

2021-03-02 at 21:25:47: @_StevenFan in more direct response to your response, yeah!!! automation cannot come soon enough, but i think it will be a looong time til academia implements wet lab robots

2021-03-02 at 21:24:53: @_StevenFan yeah i feel wet lab work is also less rewarding than building something bc (1) you aren’t able to perceive what you’re doing, and (2) it’s repetitive action that doesn’t feel like it’s building up to anything (versus an assembled final product)

2021-03-02 at 21:22:23: asking because i’m not enjoying it at present &amp; i don’t know if it’s because i’ve fallen out of practice, or if i just don’t enjoy the monotony

2021-03-02 at 21:21:32: okay so i know that some people enjoy the feeling of building something (physically putting together a machine, carpentry, etc)

wet lab work is similarly tactile - are there people out there who enjoy it?

2021-03-02 at 17:21:41: reminded of a few years ago - i was on tinder in socal, and the guy i matched with told me i “give off the ‘can make art across mediums’ type of vibe”

at the time i was like ??? but thinking back on it i quite like it

2021-03-02 at 05:22:25: @kitten_beloved @acidshill reminds me, ram dass says in a talk that there comes a point where you no longer want to be high, you want to be free

when you’re high you always come back down, when you’re low you always come back up

2021-03-02 at 01:34:57: at every turn, the wording of this post makes me laugh

&gt; because i believe camp sites attract campers

2021-03-02 at 01:33:30: this guy gets it https://t.co/bLI2XBUJjE

2021-03-01 at 23:20:08: wanna put my nascent music production skills to work &amp; make a (shitty) EP

2021-03-01 at 23:08:52: thread of stuff i don’t know how to do yet, but with a little bit of activation energy i could do — and the payoff in my own sense of agency and skill would be tremendous 

will QT as i figure these things out

⬇️

2021-03-01 at 22:51:35: @seconds_0 @sadalsvvd this is not to say you should change your pricing model, because it may be perfect for how you’re setting up this service. just another data point!

2021-03-01 at 22:50:49: @seconds_0 @sadalsvvd adding to this, the hourly pricing model caught me a bit by surprise - the astrologer my family consults in india charges a flat rate per reading, where a reading is motivated by a few questions/categories (career, health, etc) &amp; the product is a written report

2021-03-01 at 22:43:02: @relic_radiation i like this framing. i think there’s a cultural absence of the notion of “tending”

it’s like — you’re either healthy or sick, and if you’re sick we will fix you but otherwise there isn’t much to fix

but health is probably more of a continuum? &amp; tending is a constant process

2021-03-01 at 22:36:08: @relic_radiation ah yes this would be so fun :))

2021-03-01 at 22:35:40: maybe i will go and practice pitching a tent in the backyard

2021-03-01 at 19:22:50: @relic_radiation i’ve been wanting to visit asheville for a bit now, i’d tentatively be interested :)

2021-03-01 at 19:12:15: from buddhism there is this notion of kalyāṇa-mittatā, or a spiritual, noble, admirable friendship

i am immensely grateful to have found a number of these friendships through twitter 🥰 https://t.co/nK7oz2syXk

2021-03-01 at 18:04:59: i remember the first time i joined one of those online subtle asian traits type facebook groups, i was genuinely shocked that other children of immigrant parents had had such similar experiences growing up

2021-03-01 at 15:42:37: @sokindling i guess my underlying thought is that as we move towards legality, the only legal use will be as a medicine, i.e. something specific must be “wrong” with you

when in reality i think many people who aren’t clinically sick could benefit from psychedelics

2021-03-01 at 15:40:15: @sokindling i’m pretty excited about psychedelic therapy as well, curious if you have any thoughts on this https://t.co/4r4VKBjQB4

2021-03-01 at 08:00:52: @kevinzawadi i got home yesterday and yes coming home to a clean room was very nice :)

2021-03-01 at 05:11:15: feels very good to promise to do things out of a deep seated desire to contribute &amp; from a place of confidence

rather than promising to do things from a place of insecurity, bc you want to show that you’re competent

2021-03-01 at 04:55:30: @liekovarpio yes yes no worries i have faith that you have a deep well of peace &amp; contentment within you

aw i’m sorry to hear :( when i feel like that i try to remember that a unique and wonderful path has led me to where i am today

2021-03-01 at 04:46:02: @liekovarpio oh no! what do you think has triggered this wave?

2021-03-01 at 04:41:01: okay so i started working this evening after a while of putting stuff off and also talked to a colleague about science stuff for a bit and now work is fun again and i never want to stop working

2021-03-01 at 03:25:10: @sadalsvvd extremely here for this

2021-03-01 at 02:51:49: just remembered that i have a cat, upon whom i can affix electrodes and record his neural activity

2021-03-01 at 01:11:42: @AngularOcean wonderful, very excited to check this out!

2021-03-01 at 00:39:25: RT @AngularOcean: This account is a plant sentience maximalist 🌱 🧠 🌱

2021-03-01 at 00:39:10: @AngularOcean can you please say more, this is an idea i am beginning to get obsessed with

2021-03-01 at 00:19:49: we are probably more like plants than we realize. we too have imperceptible tendrils that we extend, moving slowly and stretching towards insight through daily effort https://t.co/toInIb5nCu

2021-03-01 at 00:09:06: re-sharing this in case it is of interest: i wrote this about my (ongoing) search for faith, and i would love to hear if there’s any resonance with your journey :)

https://t.co/8bLHb05rgA

2021-03-01 at 00:05:17: @ArtirKel classic josé response :D

2021-03-01 at 00:00:59: @liekovarpio currently on repeat &amp; i love album cover

https://t.co/i4tx5a4ZJ1

2021-02-28 at 23:32:46: to be clear, i think therapy can be useful, and i would like to learn more about the different types of therapy. but ultimately therapy is just one kind of salve that isn’t appropriate for every open wound

2021-02-28 at 23:30:23: i was listening to a podcast yesterday which emphasized how helpless children feel &amp; i think the inclination to outsource all of our emotional processing is a related form of this helplessness

2021-02-28 at 23:24:33: there is something not right about how therapy is the blanket answer to any sort of malaise a person experiences

2021-02-28 at 23:20:29: @ArtirKel i think this is the dominant frame right now and it rocked my world the first time i heard it

2021-02-28 at 23:20:00: @ArtirKel hmm, yeah, what do you think of the framing of longevity where aging is an ailment to be fixed?

2021-02-28 at 23:16:51: (that being said i think the intentional choice to be sober for a while or for a short period can do wonders for purifying your energy)

2021-02-28 at 23:16:13: i think drugs can be integrated into your own curriculum for spiritual growth (that is to say you don’t need to pick *either* drugs *or* spirituality, they can be synergistic together)

2021-02-28 at 23:15:42: i think drugs can be part of a life well-lived

2021-02-28 at 23:13:07: i am wondering, though, if there’s anything detrimental about framing drugs as being a form of medicine, i.e. there must be something wrong with you for this to benefit you

2021-02-28 at 23:11:59: so i am really excited about how various drugs are being granted breakthrough status &amp; are having tremendous success treating chronic pain, treatment-resistant depression, etc

culturally this seems to signify the recognition of drugs’ therapeutic potential

2021-02-28 at 22:52:06: @ArtirKel it looks like tomorrow should be just like this too :3

2021-02-28 at 22:51:33: this is the perpetual quandary of my life. if it is sunny outside my brain short circuits and all my plans for productivity go out the window

2021-02-28 at 22:50:04: i gotta go to work today to do some qpcr and i’ve been putting it off because it’s so beautiful outside

2021-02-28 at 22:44:47: @imhinesmi @natural_hazard i also thought english!

2021-02-28 at 19:38:51: oh here are some photos from LA this past week! https://t.co/eYs14Fv5q6

2021-02-28 at 19:16:38: as with any duality, gotta explore the “place where we are one ... [so we] can delight in the dance of two”

2021-02-28 at 19:13:00: i think spiritual seeking &amp; intellectual seeking have a lot in common

2021-02-27 at 04:33:30: @_holyweather i got u if u want! to invite someone you need their phone # and name

you get one invite by default &amp; get more as you are active on the app

2021-02-26 at 21:48:25: this is one of my favorite books on the nature of work, and so i will return to it today in hopes of relearning what enjoying work can look like https://t.co/w1yd1jYpZ3

2021-02-26 at 21:47:17: i have had the pervasive sense that i do not work hard enough, for a little while now (weeks, maybe months). perhaps this is because i am not enjoying my work as much as i could be

2021-02-26 at 21:08:09: @blisstweeting aw thank you so much phil, it means a lot :)

2021-02-26 at 20:30:20: hm, i am having an extraordinarily difficult time focusing today. going to try and fix this rather than existing in a mental fog

2021-02-26 at 19:06:40: https://t.co/8bLHb05rgA

2021-02-26 at 18:54:52: krishnamurti has some bangers on the purpose of education and i am grateful to have come across them at this juncture

2021-02-26 at 00:42:28: @krishkhubchand i almost worked in a lab that was doing mri for plants, one day i wanna get back to that and elucidate all those amazingly complex &amp; large root structures

2021-02-25 at 08:06:36: @_holyweather it was extremely lit 😌

2021-02-25 at 08:01:56: @_holyweather i once went to a house party on the same block tupac used to live on!

2021-02-24 at 20:17:27: @__frye if you're comfortable w it putting your location can help

based on that people can find you &amp; reach out if you're in the same town (you can also reach out to people in the same town &amp; ask to go on a walk or similar, w/o necessarily putting your location down)

2021-02-23 at 23:35:30: @NoaidiX sorry to hear you got bad news, sending you strength and love as you process 💛

2021-02-23 at 21:21:32: @moothought ☺️💯

2021-02-23 at 21:16:38: finally figured out how to end an essay i started writing like three months ago!!!

2021-02-23 at 07:57:00: @acidshill (hypothetical scenario is extremely similar to how i met bf. spent a summer together, 1 month in i got hit by the panic &amp; dread of future separation. but long distance has been working &amp; not too much longer til we close the distance !)

2021-02-23 at 06:11:41: hehe i did exactly this

2021-02-22 at 21:38:53: @NoiseGateStudio 😂 i figured you would have something interesting to say, i asked mostly as a rhetorical device

2021-02-22 at 21:36:09: queueing up several ram dass lectures for a long drive

2021-02-22 at 20:41:00: @NoiseGateStudio ooh can you elaborate? have you gone through periods of not being satisfied?

2021-02-22 at 19:39:34: @disconcerta til what a fugue state is, what a handy phrase

2021-02-22 at 19:35:54: @actualhog omg i misinterpreted

&gt; mostly *study drugs* for working, where study drugs is a noun (what u meant)

&gt; mostly *study* drugs for working, where study is a verb (what i thought)

interesting that you think caffeine is the best. have you tried caffeine + l-theanine (matcha)?

2021-02-22 at 19:20:51: @actualhog oh cool! what kind of drugs, and do you do pharmacy related work or research or something else?

2021-02-22 at 19:00:28: what does your relationship to drugs look like?

2021-02-22 at 18:18:23: might engage in casual escapism and drive down to LA this afternoon

2021-02-22 at 18:13:05: a former roommate had the instinct to clean her living space before leaving for an extended period, so that she would come back to a clean space

at the time this was very foreign to me

2021-02-20 at 20:33:10: sorry to get angsty on the tl guys

2021-02-20 at 20:32:35: i often feel bad that i have to learn this, i wish it was hard-coded into me, that i was genuinely a “good person”

2021-02-20 at 20:28:15: i feel like a significant part of growing up, for me, has been learning how to be consciously kind to others - acknowledging other people’s efforts, becoming aware of how i affect others, learning to do a little extra to show i care

2021-02-20 at 17:13:01: going camping today!

2021-02-20 at 03:24:17: @PrinceVogel @karmacustodian @densityexpert aww! have fun guys!

2021-02-19 at 16:08:55: @_holyweather @erienneyoung !! this was going to be my answer too, “immersion blender”! my most common use case is soups

2021-02-19 at 09:51:51: @lalaAlicelala i was! :)

2021-02-19 at 07:42:21: @eIfcup aww i’m very happy to hear this ❤️

2021-02-19 at 07:16:42: @lalaAlicelala @goblinodds @EggProphet dude i miiight be in town depending on when your flight is, would be down for a lil park meet up or walk

2021-02-19 at 02:42:47: (lemme know if this helps any of u guys ever. this is all extremely tailored to me but might help someone else 🤷🏽‍♀️☺️)

2021-02-19 at 02:39:47: • along a similar vein, be both thoughtful &amp; prolific in communications (twitter, dm’s, texting). this is counterintuitive. combat your instinct to shut down. keep your channels open to insight &amp; love
• a little alcohol can relieve your inhibitions around letting self be happy

2021-02-19 at 02:38:06: • write!!! this will kickstart processing all the underlying feelings that are triggering this state, and will convince you that your brain is a good one (don’t overdo the writing)

2021-02-19 at 02:35:33: • caffeine is great as a mood-booster and makes you more intense in a way you love, but you need to be decently rested
• i know it’s hard to focus on reading, a thing that normally gives you strength. das ok. watching spiritual videos is a good compromise

2021-02-19 at 02:33:31: notes for future me:

• it took approx a week to bounce back
• keep faith that your zest for life will return
• spend time around energizing friends, don’t be afraid to let yourself feel joy with them

2021-02-19 at 02:32:28: it took a few days but my desire to do the things i have to do and the things i want to do seems to have returned :)

2021-02-19 at 02:12:54: @Thinkwert this tweet is an absolute banger!

2021-02-18 at 15:31:49: @kbala444 this makes a lot of sense, thank you karthik. when i opened twitter and saw a bunch of notifications all from you i was like yes !!! he's dispensing wisdom !!!

2021-02-18 at 03:55:54: @TheDecentTech it was my first time meeting her, i felt inexplicably drawn towards her &amp; positively towards her, and her being herself in that earnest way opened me up to being that way myself

now i am much more able to sing from my heart

2021-02-18 at 03:54:35: @TheDecentTech i use this mental model quite a bit these days so hard to pinpoint *best* but the first time i consciously remember: there was a woman at this bonfire i was at who was completely at ease with herself and put her whole heart into singing, and her voice felt very raw &amp; earnest

2021-02-18 at 03:50:46: thank you to those who have liked first tweet 🥰

i’ll follow you guys from other acct later today, you should be able to recognize bc location will be the same

2021-02-18 at 03:27:09: shouting into the void is cool and all but having friends to engage with makes things so much more fun 🥺

2021-02-18 at 03:25:34: hi friends i have a realname main where i’m trying to talk more about science and work and do more crystallizing of thinking and maybe generally showcase different parts of myself

would you mind liking this tweet if you have any interest in engaging with that account?

2021-02-18 at 01:30:18: @EggProphet 😔

2021-02-18 at 01:23:11: i’m an effusive irreverent motherfucker and i am convinced that this is the best way to be

2021-02-18 at 01:21:45: ok i think mbti has its issues but i’m talking to this one old friend and her coldness is really throwing me off and all i can think about is how she’s an entj

2021-02-18 at 01:17:38: self worth mental model bf introduced to me: u gotta recognize your own worth &amp; act like it, in this way you don’t rely on other people to assess your worth; they can just piggyback of off the way you’ve appraised yourself

2021-02-17 at 21:03:31: @Probably_Brian brian, this is a deep cut. incredible

2021-02-17 at 21:02:59: @kevinzawadi huh yeah the notion of being overwhelmed/unprepared makes sense to me

maybe it’s a matter of finding different modes/ways of seeking truth?

if you feel like sharing, was there something particular that made you feel overwhelmed?

2021-02-17 at 20:23:49: “the artist’s way” week 1 has a quote like, a 20 min walk can radically change your consciousness. it’s sunny and cold out, gonna give ‘er a go

2021-02-17 at 20:22:08: visit day for viable option school is later this week, so i will resolve to be intensely present all day and to gauge how interactions with people there make me feel

i’ll go on a walk now and figure out if anything i can do to influence “dream school”, to mitigate powerlessness

2021-02-17 at 20:14:26: on the bright side it looks pretty friggin likely i’ll get to move in w boyf late summer/fall :’)

2021-02-17 at 20:12:11: kinda feeling both powerless and paralyzed in my ability to affect my own fate and i don’t like it ☹️

idk if worth emailing PI(s) at “dream school” to reaffirm interest

2021-02-17 at 20:09:27: concretely, i haven’t heard a thing back from my “dream school”, i have a friend who heard back a while (~2 months) ago

another school is looking like a viable option (basically accepted) but i have some reservations about the intellectual environment there

2021-02-17 at 20:05:28: keep on imagining &amp; comparing grad school options (both hypothetical and concrete) in my head

i keep asking, “could i be happy here?” which is kind of a moot point bc i genuinely believe i could be happy anywhere

feeling kinda obsessive and kinda exhausted

2021-02-17 at 03:14:41: @thesravaka please disclose me! thank u!

2021-02-17 at 02:51:42: @EggProphet u kno i haven't actually decided what i'm going to do this summer, aside from probably not work, so this is an option

2021-02-17 at 02:50:16: maybe after doing my phd i will disappear to the mountains of santa cruz and spend the rest of my days contemplating magnetic fields among the redwoods

2021-02-16 at 23:08:04: 5.21 i’m on board with, but having difficulty parsing 5.20 and 5.22

5.20 - emotions are ok and a wonderful part of being human, i wouldn’t want perpetual ambivalence?

5.22 - “sense pleasures” can be a legitimate source of happiness, ofc not the only one

any thoughts y’all? https://t.co/oSwMVn9po5

2021-02-16 at 20:18:42: @nickcammarata @uncatherio :))) 💗

2021-02-16 at 20:17:33: @adjacentgrace have you come across the book “self renewal” by john gardner? i think it may add to this line of thought in a nice way

2021-02-16 at 19:37:19: @alth0u i am interested, i’ll give it a try!

2021-02-16 at 19:33:09: @kevinzawadi kevin! tell me more!

2021-02-16 at 19:30:02: iirc in ptc creo you can make nifty assemblies &amp; animate them too

2021-02-16 at 19:28:43: might fuck around and CAD macro versions of cellular ion pumps

2021-02-16 at 19:26:09: @nickcammarata @uncatherio tangential but: @ nick ooh! new location! “spacious passion” is very evocative

2021-02-16 at 19:04:49: @uncatherio i’ve been trying to tweet on “main” too and experiencing similar fear, with only 20ish followers! i think the similarity is that the fears stems from the absence of the social group i’ve come to rely on here

2021-02-16 at 18:13:36: @alth0u couple weeks ago was driving in hills in like altadena and the sight of downtown LA in the distance took my breath away

2021-02-16 at 18:11:35: @alth0u dude 100% ‼️ frankly embarrassed i forgot about it

2021-02-16 at 18:08:27: piety is extremely lindy

2021-02-16 at 17:54:26: @karmacustodian i don’t strictly agree with sacred music = music that sounds good, give me a bit to collect my thoughts

2021-02-16 at 17:51:00: @itsLuciKeller quarantine at approved hotel mandate is absolutely bonkers

2021-02-16 at 06:01:23: @ArtirKel (1) i’ve long since grown out of it, (2) culture is a helluva drug, extricating myself from binge drinking culture @ college means i no longer feel its pull

2021-02-16 at 05:52:04: dude i regularly drank so much that i was puking &amp; even had hangovers so bad i couldn’t keep water down til 8pm the next day

2021-02-16 at 05:50:33: @trevor_a_a oh can you explain! “reality” doesn’t seem like an obvious substitution to me, but i’m interested to hear your thinking

2021-02-16 at 05:49:50: hm was binge drinking in college a form of dissociation

2021-02-16 at 05:38:06: @acidshill i normally drive down to pasadena/burbank rather than downtown so i don’t remember those specific tunnels 😭 can check em out on google maps tho

2021-02-16 at 05:36:42: @itsLuciKeller aw young luci so cyoot 🥺

2021-02-16 at 03:15:52: @acidshill @goblinodds @DrewCoffman feel free to give me that list too haha

2021-02-16 at 00:54:20: @erienneyoung thank you for these kind words 💛 i am drawn to your maternal, cosmic, and deeply kind energy, and am equally excited to deepen our mutualism :))

2021-02-16 at 00:46:42: does the notion of or search for “truth” have a strong aesthetic pull for you?

2021-02-16 at 00:43:42: @acidshill ty for answering! :) interesting that you bring up the old style of bridges n tunnels, that isn’t something i’ve noticed before but i’ll be on the lookout next time i’m in town

2021-02-16 at 00:42:31: @disconcerta ‼️☀️ i remember being utterly disoriented the first time i visited, with how it was sunny and 80 F in friggin january

2021-02-16 at 00:41:20: @DrewCoffman aw i love both answers, particularly the phrasing of the latter 💛

where are you from, and how does LA compare to there? (unless of course you’re from LA 🙈)

2021-02-16 at 00:14:29: paging @DrewCoffman @goblinodds 
@acidshill, if you have any thoughts :)

2021-02-16 at 00:04:47: @gracemercur :)) do you remember what parts of the city you went to?

i remember feeling like that visiting hollywood blvd with my family, and recently when driving past mulholland drive (god, what a phenomenal movie)

2021-02-16 at 00:02:15: is it an uneasy peace or a stirring lethargy

2021-02-15 at 23:58:43: if you live(d) in LA or have otherwise had exposure to the city, what do you love about it?

2021-02-15 at 23:22:00: thinking about wildly variant timescales in our bodies: on the longer side, hair growth; on the medium side, action potentials in the heart or brain; on the shorter side, ion pumps shepherding ions across the cell membrane

2021-02-15 at 22:55:49: @liekovarpio the city (?) lights in the distance are just sublime

2021-02-15 at 14:25:51: @gracemercur what’s the problem?

2021-02-14 at 07:18:59: @meekaale my sense is that this (not working optimally w/o enough sleep) is the case with stimulants, more broadly, even including caffeine

2021-02-13 at 20:52:45: if you have the chance to spoon or snuggle someone you should hold them extra tight every so often so that in your arms they feel like the most precious thing in the universe

2021-02-13 at 10:12:07: @eIfcup next time i walk by it i’m gonna try and take a pic at this exact angle so i can say i’ve stood exactly where ali stood

2021-02-12 at 23:09:56: @noampomsky also there are pandemic themed valentine’s cards!!! a whole subgenre of “flirty - pandemic” cards, iirc there was one that went:

(outside) you are cordially invited to invade my personal space

(inside) let’s spend this valentine’s day anything but social distanced

2021-02-12 at 23:06:49: @noampomsky this was me yesterday.... couldn’t find a valentine’s day card that pleased me aesthetically so i picked a “wedding” card that could be construed as a valentine’s card instead 🙈

2021-02-12 at 22:24:26: @michellehuang42 i’d love to try !

2021-02-12 at 21:02:33: @krishkhubchand found u on clubhouse watch me starting hindi rooms to chat w u

2021-02-12 at 20:27:47: i imagine sirens must sound a whole different way in a rural landscape, in the cities i’ve lived in i think we’ve become desensitized to what they signify. if we’re lucky we perceive the doppler effect but sirens no longer shake me

2021-02-12 at 20:09:57: @whomademecrispy have you read thinking fast and slow? (collecting data, trying to figure out general sentiment on this book, i did not even come close to finishing)

2021-02-12 at 19:34:25: @krishkhubchand 😱 i guess i have to now!!!

do u kno hindi by chance

2021-02-12 at 19:33:38: brain stuck on value of sacred vibrations after listening to @karmacustodian’s chanting fleet 🔥

2021-02-12 at 19:32:56: i know very little about carnatic music but given my interest / belief in sacred vibrations there must be a lot to explore there

2021-02-12 at 19:29:59: huh i could get really good at hindi and then freak my parents out (in a good way)

this would be fun

2021-02-12 at 19:24:20: my nani (maternal grandmother) is similarly sentimental (interestingly i have her eyes) but my mother is not. sentimentality skipped a generation, evidently

2021-02-12 at 19:22:44: i am a deeply sentimental person and i used to think that this was a bad thing

2021-02-12 at 19:06:43: extraordinarily excited about life today, especially the next 6-12 months

2021-02-12 at 16:35:31: @Virtual1nstinct oop i just saw your follow up tweet don’t mind me

2021-02-10 at 21:14:33: @EggProphet have you read rest of book, if so did you like it?

2021-02-10 at 21:13:59: @EggProphet i love this particular quote, i think “shapely” is a good word for it haha

recently when i was on a type of drugs i remember feeling deeply, “we are just particles in motion, aren’t we?”

dunno exactly what to make of that 🤷🏽‍♀️

2021-02-10 at 21:07:50: “A couple in love walking along the banks of the Seine are, in real fact, a couple in love walking along the banks of the Seine, not mere particles in motion.” https://t.co/PDhseRECAR

2021-02-10 at 21:05:25: “Laplace’s particles in motion allow only _happenings_. There are no meanings, no values, no doings.

...In this book I will demonstrate the inadequacy of reductionism. Even major physicists now doubt its full legitimacy... biology... cannot be reduced to physics alone...”

2021-02-10 at 21:02:06: live tweeting “reinventing the sacred”, which i’m only 3 pages into but i’m already obsessed with:

2021-02-10 at 20:56:29: @gigafelon dude i need to take a note from your book 🤦🏾‍♀️ https://t.co/UZ0gs1QE2F

2021-02-10 at 20:54:45: @gigafelon here are some recent photos i love

• first two are my new room, which i find very cozy &amp; am very happy with
• third is view eastward from bernal heights in sf
• fourth is a kinda otherworldly flower i basically walked into when i was tripping 😂😂😂 https://t.co/BksxMgG8gT

2021-02-10 at 20:52:18: @gigafelon ‼️omg!

i went from a shitty android to an iphone a couple months ago and the improvement in camera quality greatly improved my quality of life

used to feel guilty abt taking pics &amp; not “being in the moment” but now i don’t care haha bc i think you can be in the moment

2021-02-10 at 20:48:17: @gigafelon imo this is extremely reasonable and you should feel no pressure to change. you got any cool photos you’ve taken recently (most probable use case for instagram, also i’m curious 😂)?

2021-02-10 at 20:45:35: @acidshill strongly reminded me of @BecomingCritter style joke tweets

2021-02-10 at 20:42:25: @gigafelon hmm def not necessary but it can be fun aesthetically. you have any other social media beyond twitter?

2021-02-10 at 20:40:32: (also fyi apparently u can search songs on spotify by lyrics now !!)

2021-02-10 at 20:39:19: tbh i have a scar on my tummy that i am a little (just a little) insecure about &amp; i kinda think a fire caption for a photo w exposed midriff would b “scar tissue that i wish you saw”

2021-02-10 at 20:37:32: have u ever captioned an instagram photo with a song lyric, come on, be honest 👀

2021-02-10 at 20:33:13: @ArtirKel oh NOICE sean carroll is a pretty good interviewer, will give it a listen

2021-02-10 at 20:32:03: @nickcammarata 😂😂😂 no worries, glad you gave it a chance

2021-02-10 at 20:21:43: @ArtirKel 👀👀👀 i haven’t read much of his stuff! any recs for where to start?

2021-02-10 at 20:20:53: put a little bit of coffee in my hot chocolate, plus a lil cinnamon &amp; chili, feeling crazy

2021-02-10 at 20:18:48: @nickcammarata ooh if you’re on a religious music kick can i rec a kirtan kinda thing - i love this one and if you stick with it for the 13 minutes you can feel the energy swelling

2021-02-10 at 20:16:55: it is pretty crazy how there’s no pre-specified blueprint for how your capillaries are distributed in your body, rather they’re formed by local cues and a signaling processing involving the factor VEGF, among others

2021-02-08 at 05:09:25: i keep on coming upon how nice my life is right now [san francisco is a visual paradise] &amp; how i can perpetuate the niceness [through ritual &amp; even the beginnings of intention]. i think in the future when i no longer live in sf, acid will bring me back to the niceness

2021-02-08 at 04:59:45: reply to this tweet and i will be a mirror (you place a mirror in a space to amplify the light)

2021-02-08 at 04:58:21: bc like we tell ourselves we’re being overloaded but do we even know what it means to be overloaded? and overloaded implies that knowing our limits is a binary neuron on/off (well fuck, maybe it is)

2021-02-08 at 04:54:47: okay i think sf has a lot of narratives superimposed upon it but what meaning does the city have to you, personally?

2021-02-08 at 04:51:27: @erienneyoung i genuinely think you are the ☀️ best ☀️ and am grateful to be able to interact with you on this medium

2021-02-08 at 04:49:57: @erienneyoung hang on calling as we speak

2021-02-08 at 04:48:38: you never really are “just saying”, are you 🤔😂

2021-02-08 at 04:47:47: any and all of these tweets are an open invitation just sayin !

2021-02-08 at 04:47:13: keep on feeling like an ocean becoming aware that it (me) is an ocean, in perceiving the way the sun hits its waves and then noticing it has waves, and if i had waves than i must be an ocean 🌊🤷🏽‍♀️🌊

2021-02-08 at 04:40:44: the first time i tripped i had a much easier time taking myself seriously

it’s been hard to give myself but fun &amp; weight &amp; gravity (but i can b both)

i’ve had a lot of fun today but i keep on grasping at — how strongly do i believe the things that are upholding my reality?

2021-02-08 at 04:35:36: seriously @yokaihainen is incredible his flair for constructing an image &amp; imbuing it with harkonen energy is spectacular (sorry for being american and ignoring the umlauts i think if i heard you pronounce harkonen once i’d know why they exist!

2021-02-04 at 01:48:56: it’s ok i’ll learn it for realsies when it calls me

2021-02-04 at 01:47:54: i did not learn any lin alg in that class and so far i’ve been ok with this gaping knowledge hole bc it isn’t relevant to anything i do... but there is a very good chance it will become relevant in phd

2021-02-02 at 18:58:38: @krishkhubchand i feel like your problem might be that you’re in your head too much &amp; maybe don’t have a way to intuitively recognize when an idea feels good or right

i used to feel this way a lot before i was able to feel my thought patterns in my body (still relatively new to me)

2021-02-02 at 09:39:32: nb i think curiosity is a really good thing and whenever i feel lost i rekindle my curiosity &amp; everything is ok. but you don’t have to be curious to be happy. i’m trying to figure out what alternatives to curiosity as a north star are (i know they exist)

2021-02-02 at 09:37:48: things that strike me as worth maximizing: serendipity, curiosity, awe/wonder

2021-02-02 at 09:20:14: look at this big baby 😭 https://t.co/KfWz8niaBN

2021-02-02 at 07:22:05: @jommorin @_StevenFan i think this is a lovely sentiment, though a part of me wonders: isn’t every generation a re-generation, in that with every generation a new set of cultures &amp; beliefs &amp; actions are enacted...?

2021-02-02 at 07:14:00: @eIfcup 😌👌

2021-02-02 at 07:10:36: @eIfcup thoughts on carleton or u of t tinder men???

2021-01-29 at 06:30:55: what’s up with the blood brain barrier, how does it know what to let in and what not to let in

blood brain barrier -&gt; general principle is a biological membrane

can we design protein purification columns (size exclusion, polarity, etc) inspired by biological membranes

2021-01-28 at 15:34:11: tbh i’ve always found the development of new sequencing methods fascinating, and better yet there’s immense potential for a profitable startup w/o having to jump through regulatory hurdles of a product used in humans (drugs, therapeutic, med device, etc)

2021-01-25 at 19:58:25: @LinchZhang :) in part yes!

2021-01-25 at 19:57:43: @PrinceVogel in the works 👀

2021-01-25 at 19:57:06: @krishkhubchand yeah i think i’m more after reasonable exposure than pure maximization, there are solid suggestions! when you were younger, who were older people who made a significant impact on you?

2021-01-25 at 19:55:53: @krzhang great suggestions, thank you 🙏

2021-01-25 at 04:57:59: when you start thinking rly positively towards someone it becomes way easier to assimilate the traits you admire about them (n = 2)

2021-01-25 at 04:42:23: throwback to when my college roommate suggested showering w the lights off in our windowless bathroom, bc the warmth and humidity took him back to the womb

2021-01-25 at 04:40:42: @averykimball YES

2021-01-25 at 04:37:34: @kevinzawadi this is a very good suggestion that didn’t occur to me! in the US i prob couldn’t work at a [public] school w/o getting additional certifications i’m not interested in getting

2021-01-25 at 04:34:53: @tentontintin 😂😂😂😂😂 YES i’ll make the most of my one year tenure b4 the curse forces me out

2021-01-25 at 04:17:12: my answer encompasses different scales:

• regions: west coast US, chungnan mountains
• cities: berkeley/sf, nyc, LA
• places: one specific park in SF, but this is only because i’ve imbued it with meaning

2021-01-25 at 04:14:45: what are places you consider spiritually charged? no wrong answer

2021-01-25 at 04:13:29: first time in life consciously noticing my relationships anchoring me to a place, in that half the time i wanna fly away and be free but then i remember there is so much yet for me to learn from these friendships &amp; this place

2021-01-25 at 04:03:09: try characterizing the bets you’re making in undertaking an endeavor

i didn’t use to do this but when u do it helps elucidate (a) your motivations and (b) your failure mode down the line

2021-01-25 at 03:55:10: how do i maximize my exposure to precocious teenagers

2021-01-24 at 22:39:15: conceptualize your brain as an instrument rather than a storehouse TODAY

2021-01-24 at 22:39:05: some people never learn to think!!!

2021-01-24 at 22:37:21: 🅱️razy that i am only now learning how to think and even 🅱️razier that that is completely ok

2021-01-24 at 22:34:19: as a currency for scientific info, it’s possible that books &gt;&gt; papers https://t.co/MMmZlVdWgX

2021-01-24 at 22:32:47: it is also possible that i need to rework my method of scientific thinking into something that is inherently magical &amp; more fun &amp; integrative n representative of my vibe-y understanding of the world

2021-01-24 at 22:31:47: in fact, indiscriminately applying scientific thinking to everything makes life less fun. you gotta learn how to balance classical &amp; romantic thinking, alternatively scientific &amp; magical

2021-01-24 at 22:30:36: being a scientist doesn’t mean u have to apply scientific thinking to everything

2021-01-24 at 22:30:16: ongoing thread of loosely held &amp; subject to change opinions about science:

2021-01-24 at 21:27:13: i think the most effective way for me to develop this sense is just to keep consuming information on this topic of interest and see what sticks ... not gonna prematurely metacognate 🤷🏽‍♀️

2021-01-24 at 21:25:57: starting to think about books versus papers as a means of collecting &amp; transmitting scientific information

of course there are other ways beyond the two

but i used to think papers were preferred information currency but now i’m not so sure

2021-01-24 at 21:24:13: amazon actually does a really good job of recommending books on a topic of interest

2021-01-24 at 21:01:36: @lisatomic5 i just remembered this tweet can i please join?!

2021-01-23 at 17:21:55: might fuck around and find a nice girl to do bible study with

2021-01-23 at 17:19:50: maybe we should venerate every substance we put into our bodies and the things that respond in kind are the ones we want to keep putting in

2021-01-22 at 06:48:24: @mcgarth_brooks lots to contemplate

• apathy and neutrality are different (makes sense)
• reason ranks above acceptance??
• interesting how low grief ranks, i think grief can be interwoven w more positive things &amp; be very meaningful

2021-01-22 at 06:42:34: @mcgarth_brooks this is doooope 🤩

2021-01-22 at 04:44:34: i came across the notion that gratitude is a high vibrational emotion. what are other high vibrational emotions? what are low vibrational emotions?

2021-01-22 at 04:42:56: @_holyweather wearing a crown in your garden or in a snow covered landscape or really anywhere in nature strikes me as quite idyllic

2021-01-22 at 04:25:25: hey if any of you have insight that could help krish's grandma, please consider replying to his tweet https://t.co/PLNVLC6RUh

2021-01-22 at 00:32:18: when i close my eyes i can see glimpses of a beautiful, symbolic landscape

2021-01-22 at 00:31:08: i think i am not having vivid dreams right now because i am not in the place to receive them

2021-01-22 at 00:30:39: must work on my receptivity

2021-01-21 at 19:30:32: hm recognizing complacency feels like the first step towards liberation

2021-01-21 at 19:29:13: how do you recognize you’ve become complacent without getting upset or frustrated?

2021-01-20 at 21:21:40: okay gonna sit down and chart my cash flow today, to figure out how much $ i have to spare for (a) buying some equipment i’ve been thinking about, (b) potentially taking a summer off

2021-01-20 at 21:17:35: meeting i was dreading today actually ended up being positive and energizing 🙇🏽‍♀️🙏

2021-01-19 at 22:05:00: i love that twitter exists, and that i have a space on here where i can put out my warmth into the world and have it reflected back

2021-01-19 at 22:01:58: @harveykrishna_ heck yeah 🤘

2021-01-19 at 22:00:17: i am so grateful that i have a good relationship with my parents and that i can trust them, and that i’m coming to trust myself when i disagree with them

2021-01-19 at 21:59:13: my mom and i were talking about phd programs and she said, you could defer and do whatever you want for a year, you’ve been working hard for 4 years, and this made me cry because i know this advice comes from her recent cancer experience &amp; her new resolve to make the most of life

2021-01-19 at 21:55:58: my cat is happy in this house https://t.co/GKvsZBIUke

2021-01-19 at 21:54:54: my housemates are all really wonderful people and they want to know me and i get to get to know them and the house i live in is beautiful and is the right place for me to be right now

2021-01-19 at 21:53:45: my parents mailed me my renewed license and in that package enclosed a card my mom wrote to me, which is again unlike her, but the card ended with the phrase “keep being the amazing young woman you are” and that made me cry a lot

2021-01-19 at 21:52:25: my parents sent me an extremely thoughtful gift yesterday which is very unusual for them because my family does not really give gifts

2021-01-19 at 21:50:42: @Virtual1nstinct CONGRATS 🤩🤩🤩

2021-01-19 at 21:49:51: crying out of gratitude for all the good things in my life don’t mind me

2021-01-18 at 08:30:21: @moothought ooooh yes i wouldn’t have picked this out for myself but i remember seeing maybegray tweet about it and thinking, there’s something very open and authentic about the way she’s promoting this thang

2021-01-18 at 08:28:50: @ArtirKel !!! dude! i’m so excited to *hear* your thinking articulated! like the written word is great and you do it especially well, but often spoken ideas stick/resonate in my head better

2021-01-18 at 08:17:51: have a long drive tomorrow anyone have ideas or content i could ponder or consume?

2021-01-18 at 08:01:38: @_holyweather a few days ago my beb was feeling off and all of a sudden he asks, could you hold me? i was so taken aback by that and was of course so happy to oblige

2021-01-18 at 06:36:56: @isosteph aw heck yeah that sounds awesome

didn’t kno u could use a beer to make bread but it makes complete sense

2021-01-17 at 03:09:00: usually i am all for clarity in writing but there’s something cool about being incomprehensible or perhaps selectively comprehensible

like articulate your thoughts but add lil easter eggs that only someone who’s read the same book / heard the same song will recognize

2021-01-17 at 03:03:29: @itsLuciKeller if u were tryna flirt w me shoulda just said so 🤧🤧🤣 https://t.co/RZLuxwlEvr

2021-01-17 at 01:49:06: i’m all for tweeting about more than your papers, but i want to see complete people! work + politics doesn’t maketh a full person

2021-01-17 at 01:48:09: drives me crazy how many academics only tweet about two things: (1) their papers and (2) their politics

2021-01-14 at 20:43:19: it is lovely sunny and 82 F right now in southern california, i have absolutely no right to fuss about anything

2021-01-12 at 01:35:29: @disconcerta u have a point. this begs the question, where is the line drawn: does frc robotics count? what abt badminton club? (we know sci oly and national honors society definitely don’t count)

2021-01-12 at 01:28:21: @disconcerta does secretary general of model UN count 🙈

2021-01-10 at 10:02:48: for some reason this tweet and this energy made me think of u @hippieforlife99 😂☺️

2021-01-10 at 10:01:02: awww man my partner is da best i am so very happy i found him, he is truly one in eight billion and i just feel so fortunate to know him and be known by him, to look fondly back on our times together and to be excited, eager, and steadfast as we head towards our future

2021-01-10 at 09:56:19: @HanjoYoutaku @_StevenFan i think you’re onto something here!! hmmm “making sense” is not quite the right way to put it, now is it

2021-01-10 at 09:38:58: something something if heaven is an eternal campfire where we get to sing songs (feel em out at first and then let the song carry you) with our kindred spirits forever ....... i would be extremely down

2021-01-10 at 09:30:43: RT @lilaexpt: good sign when you feel your mother’s love in the things you do to care for yourself

2021-01-10 at 09:09:45: https://t.co/TZg9hg9fJ4

2021-01-10 at 09:07:48: it’s like a level-headedness and an acceptance and a love that comes from the earth itself and everyone else who embraces it (especially feminine spirits), a sort of maternal self assured ness &amp; faith that everything will sort itself out, because someone needs to have that faith

2021-01-10 at 09:05:58: holy heck my taurus rising is showing herself and i love it

2021-01-10 at 09:03:45: guys i am so cozy right now! picked the perfect socks n pj pants and sweatshirt and i know i am loved &amp; i know deep down how to show others i love them :)))

2021-01-10 at 08:44:39: @kehwho :))) i super recently learned about my dad’s side of the family going back 2-3 generations and it was so nice to finally hear that, feels like a connection to something deeper &amp; makes u feel more complete

2021-01-10 at 08:32:32: @_StevenFan something something ox herding picture sequence is reminiscent of this, like the final step of enlightenment is finding a way to share the bliss and peace in a way that makes sense to others (i.e. bringing the oxes back to market)

2021-01-08 at 23:33:11: @itsLuciKeller dude i LOVE this too, read the whole article and was nodding along the whole friggin way

2021-01-06 at 23:30:15: @Levi7hart thank you for asking! do you work in / have an interest in biotech/biology?

2021-01-06 at 23:25:34: @Levi7hart in general i'm trying to be more thoughtful when planning experiments &amp; this provided a nice structure towards that

2021-01-06 at 23:22:08: @Levi7hart it has a compelling premise: using a statistical approach to reduce the search space in biology experimental design https://t.co/3tD8wPpexD

2021-01-06 at 00:17:13: @lilmaudlin also a valid field of study 😎😎😎

2020-12-29 at 22:41:53: @kehwho i have been feeling extremely drawn to tai chi recently so just started that a few days ago and !!!! it feels so good !!! how bout that water energy calling my name

2020-12-29 at 22:40:52: @kehwho :))))) i didn’t want to reply n stop your train of thought but this is all very validating. i’m excited to work w elements intuition attunement &amp; feel things clicking into place. i’ve gotten used to the helplessness of conventional medicine where body is treated as black box

2020-12-29 at 22:34:22: @upoutandaway i’m in let’s go!!!

2020-12-29 at 22:27:34: @AnotherPattern (this is just me theorizing)

2020-12-29 at 22:27:05: @AnotherPattern hmm i wonder what happens to trauma as you address it. my guess is you work towards liberation from its effects, but then what? is it refactored into strength/peace? can it be overcome -&gt; forgotten (must be some cases where forgetting is desirable)?

2020-12-29 at 22:22:53: @AnotherPattern okok i think i see what you’re after. can you give me an example of a work of fiction w a character’s loss -&gt; growth, so i can ground in a concrete example?

2020-12-29 at 22:10:52: @AnotherPattern happy to talk in dms if either of those align with your interests, and even if they don’t :’)

2020-12-29 at 22:09:39: @AnotherPattern more recently i’ve become aware of some intergenerational trauma and so i can’t speak to getting past it quite yet

2020-12-29 at 22:07:37: @AnotherPattern twitter (along with some serendipitous life experiences) has helped me work past some trauma due to childhood illness

2020-12-29 at 22:06:09: @AnotherPattern is there a specific type of trauma you’re thinking about?

2020-12-29 at 22:02:37: @AnotherPattern yes of course i mind how dare u 😤

2020-12-29 at 21:58:02: @kehwho but through repetition i’ll get used to what having an embodied moon cycle feels like and then i think i’ll be able to work better w herbs!!!

2020-12-29 at 21:56:57: @kehwho rather than just herbs, i’m thinking now that i can create an external moon cycle for my body to follow, through practices like water fasting. then layer herbs on top of that. the first time through, this external moon cycle probably gonna feel weird

2020-12-29 at 21:54:21: @kehwho for resolving this hormonal dysfunction i vaguely know there are herbs i can take but the part i was struggling to figure out was: how do i know they’re working? do i just need to wait to feel an ambiguous “something” in my body? https://t.co/4tikm3Al2P

2020-12-29 at 21:48:13: @kehwho ! this is giving me ideas on how to take an integrated approach to healing myself

2020-12-29 at 21:14:37: @owenbroadcast reminds me of this 2016 essay by aella (opens with a conversation w a saudi businessman)

yes, driving is a burden, responsibilities are a burden, but what is missing is the ability to choose whether or not you (male or female) want to take them on https://t.co/7TXiCCS2JN

2020-12-29 at 19:54:30: @default_friend make glowing plants 🌱🙈

2020-12-29 at 19:45:20: i often get caught up in how few or how many people follow/interact with me (let’s be real, how few) but every time i have a genuine interaction with someone on here or i am able to share a genuine feeling with you guys... goddamn. that’s why i’m on this thing

2020-12-29 at 19:36:07: feels odd to publicly share pics of this rather intimate space but trust it is sunlit, green, and lovely, with a shelf of seedlings and many little bags of seeds. this was my mother’s happy place and i can feel that energy

2020-12-29 at 19:32:54: i’ve found heaven on earth and it’s my mother’s greenhouse

2020-12-29 at 08:51:04: starting this tomorrow (today?), will let you guys know if it’s any good https://t.co/3efajYKfQp

2020-12-29 at 00:51:11: coming soon:
• the importance of grieving rituals (intuited)
• grieving rituals (researched)

2020-12-29 at 00:51:10: (you shouldn’t have to know why you’re doing everything you’re doing in a ritual, often learning after the fact is fun! but what to do when the bloat is excessive, but to identify the excess?)

2020-12-29 at 00:51:10: mom remembers: at her wedding, she was made to transfer grains between pots. she says: what was the point of that? probably, some girl years ago was anxious and was given the task to keep her calm. and so this task became part of hindu-wedding-canon https://t.co/XKVTwZQWF9

2020-12-29 at 00:51:09: beyond cremation: indian weddings are often a 2-4 day affair, but the actual wedding-of-the-two-people is a ceremony that takes ~2 hours. how did we get to a 4 day event!

2020-12-29 at 00:51:08: imo this bloat is bad bc it turns people off from rituals due to their perceived inconvenience &amp; frivolity, when in fact these traditions are good, meaning-laden, and valid at their core

2020-12-29 at 00:51:08: over generations, peripheral actions like tying a cat to a tree were formalized &amp; added to the cremation canon. over a thousand years, these actions have added up and collectively constitute bloat. 

we've ended up a ways away from the essence of the ritual.

2020-12-29 at 00:51:08: time passed and the sadhu and his cat passed away. now, it was time for the disciple to carry out his first cremation! so, first things first, he made sure to get a cat and tie it to a tree. 🤦🏾‍♀️

2020-12-29 at 00:51:08: the sadhu also had a disciple who dutifully noted down every part of the cremation ritual, so that he could carry it out himself once the sadhu was no more. the disciple was thorough but did not question the steps of the ritual.

2020-12-29 at 00:51:07: on bloated rituals ... 🧵

my mom told me: many years ago there was a sadhu who was in charge of cremations in his village. the sadhu had a cat who went with him everywhere. at each cremation, the sadhu would tie his cat to a tree so the lil creature wouldn't jump into the fire.

2020-12-28 at 18:15:24: @itsLuciKeller hehe 🥰

2020-12-27 at 06:06:47: @marginalkoala “meaning is not something you stumble across ... meaning is something you build into your life”

2020-12-27 at 05:59:33: @marginalkoala suuuper interesting how he says both “*parents* and ... society at large have a hand in building our prisons”. been thinking recently about the various fears &amp; self-limiting beliefs instilled in me when i was young &amp; the process of slowly recognizing &amp; undoing them https://t.co/1S2YyNmmIB

2020-12-27 at 05:57:03: @marginalkoala realized i’m especially interested in his book bc i do a lot of individual-scale thinking but he applies self-renewal to *institutions*

thank you for sharing article!! specific bits that resonated w me lesgooo ⬇️

2020-12-27 at 05:38:14: @erienneyoung are there other books of his you would recommend? 😊

2020-12-27 at 05:37:11: @erienneyoung no! this is my first exposure, this particular copy was gifted to my dad in ‘89 and for some reason it resurfaced today. skimmed and it resonated, excited to read also bc i think it will help me understand my dad’s relationship w spirituality

2020-12-26 at 01:52:08: @disconcerta aha i’m already a bit addicted. i think it can be done well though! e.g. i’m inspired by (1) steven fan’s constant introspection on how to use the platform better, (2) willow’s twitter-real life balance, (3) keh’s powerful yet lyrical yet young voice

2020-12-26 at 00:58:09: @neurograce oomg this has been a long-open tab of mine too!

2020-12-25 at 22:08:44: @itsLuciKeller omg i was just thinking of this yesterday, excited you shared it!

2020-12-25 at 21:28:30: i think i gotta find a better way to integrate my day to day thinking / work / life into what i share on here. the divide between real &amp; digital feels necessary but not correctly executed at present

2020-12-22 at 02:13:46: @uncatherio that sounds good! regardless, i’ve only heard of two artists from your list (odesza &amp; emancipator), so will be fun to explore 😊

2020-12-22 at 02:12:01: @uncatherio oh another facet of how i define ambient is the intent/approach to production, ambient makes me thinking of modulation &amp; synths &amp; huge set ups &amp; layering sounds &amp; creating textures

2020-12-22 at 02:11:05: @uncatherio admittedly my current definition of ambient is pretty limited, r beny and celer epitomize the genre for me and strike me as pretty speculative (perhaps they represent a subgenre)

i’ll work my way through your recs!

2020-12-22 at 02:01:30: @magicianbrain yes!!! it’s both rhythmic (pop 4 and pop 7) and ambiguously uplifting, i love it 😭😭 thank you 🙏

2020-12-22 at 01:56:31: hm maybe don’t consciously strive for thematic cohesion in your pursuits &amp; outputs, let the cohesion arise organically &amp; iteratively, and in the meantime be guided by the amorphous but distinct feeling of “this feels good”

2020-12-21 at 23:34:58: ISO rhythmic/uplifting ambient music, if it even exists

2020-12-18 at 13:56:21: (constantly searching for people who have defied the academic mold or made it work for them, following their own internal compass of curiosity, e.g. stuart kauffman (latter) &amp; thought emporium youtube channel justin (former))

2020-12-18 at 13:49:12: science academia does the opposite of encourage curiosity (the researcher’s lifeblood), rather it asks you to find a niche you can comfortably occupy &amp; write dozens of papers on &amp; convince others you preside over

2020-12-18 at 13:46:13: used to think i could only be an academic/scientist and there was no room for art or creativity beyond what my research demanded but i’m feeling called to do more art now &amp; why not both, why not all, why not do the things you feel drawn to even if they’re not cohesive

2020-12-18 at 13:43:58: used to think entertainment consumption was a waste of time but i realize it nourishes internal aesthete &amp; fuels subconscious thinking

2020-12-18 at 13:42:23: watching movies and tv shows (particularly futuristic ones) expands sense of what’s possible &amp; motivates me to do more science

2020-12-18 at 13:40:38: reading lots of books &amp; essays makes disparate regions of brain fire and link concepts which makes me do science better or at least think better, more creatively, more pliable and with greater tolerance for chaos

2020-12-15 at 07:36:43: @EggProphet recently i've been finding new meaning in words/concepts i thought i understood, namely: fear, intuition, trust. im sensing that fullness might be another word whose re-working will bear fruit in some way

2020-12-15 at 07:33:37: @EggProphet i have no doubt that you are correct

2020-12-14 at 00:47:11: how do https://t.co/JBYlCUiGM1

2020-12-14 at 00:42:56: i must remain simple in search of god and greatness

2020-12-14 at 00:42:28: what a good reminder. bless his heart and patience for my grand, fantastical notions

2020-12-14 at 00:41:27: i was bogged down in technical / scripture based language and growing more cynical, and bf pointed out: one thing that’s undervalued is the simple notion of just being kind

2020-12-14 at 00:41:00: one thing i was trying to reconcile friday night: how do i figure out how to protect my energy from those that drain it while also loving like a lamp sheds its light: indiscriminately &amp; without trying to hold onto those in its grasp

2020-12-14 at 00:40:31: at the time, i was a little frustrated and wished he’d get on my level!

further reflection on this instance is surfacing positive things about bf i gotta share: he is excellent at using mathematics as a language and a tool for thought. he is also a capital g Good person.

2020-12-14 at 00:39:36: reflecting, i’m realizing that not always being on the same level is ok and natural, and isn’t necessarily a bad thing. obvious but a good thing to be reminded of.

2020-12-14 at 00:39:08: second, sudden awareness of operating at a different frequency than bf. i take for granted that he and i are operating at the same frequency much of the time.

2020-12-14 at 00:38:17: couple things here: first, a sense of pride at my brain working unusually fast &amp; being capable of such clear thought / synthesis of disparate ideas. i have had glimpses of this state but i think a recent acid trip has enabled me to access this state more consciously.

2020-12-14 at 00:37:46: (2) tipsy this past friday night, making dinner with bf, thinking out loud through intersections between ideas in the books i’ve been reading, pausing to let him reply, and he said, “... i think your brain is working quite a bit faster than mine”

2020-12-14 at 00:04:02: i think our dynamic changed a few weeks ago, when i was earnestly evangelizing the book “many lives, many masters” to her and she was like yes, i’m familiar with it... you believe in it too?

2020-12-14 at 00:03:16: necessary context: (a) before this, our faith-related conversations were mostly my mom gently berating me for not chanting prayers enough; (b) my mom is an icon of mine as far as how to approach religion, she’s very good at finding &amp; trying various practices &amp; keeping what sticks

2020-12-14 at 00:02:11: i was even more surprised at my answer: “there’s a lot going on, so i’ve been using my practice more to balance &amp; center myself than to explore”. of course there’s exploration inherent in that process, but having the confidence to delineate that distinction is new.

2020-12-14 at 00:01:35: (1) in a recent video call with my mom, she asked, “how’s your spiritual practice going?” 

this floored me. i was surprised that she viewed my spiritual practice as legit and something she wanted to know about.

2020-12-14 at 00:01:11: two recent interactions i’ve been thinking about:

2020-12-13 at 23:52:02: RT @_StevenFan: I apologize to the people i have obvious resonance with but haven't reached out to yet

2020-12-13 at 23:51:50: sufjan stevens on vague lyrics rather than memoiristic lyrics. i feel this applies to twitter as well: balancing sharing specific things in our lives versus more generalizable insights https://t.co/1dvgH4Xsw5

2020-12-12 at 05:24:51: @upoutandaway i do however think that this is an extremely valid question &amp; i’m curious what sparked it

2020-12-12 at 05:23:50: @upoutandaway in my own experience: intuition has infinitely many opportunities to lead you astray, the revolutionary act is choosing to trust &amp; listen to yourself regardless

2020-12-12 at 04:11:46: @HanjoYoutaku tbh broader societal shifts ideally shouldn’t have a bearing on your day to day life ... ideally you’re grounded enough in your own principles &amp; values &amp; you have a small group of people with whom you can convene and grow

2020-12-12 at 04:09:59: @HanjoYoutaku i think i agree with you on societal shifts not being literal shifts in thinking

2020-12-08 at 22:05:09: @_StevenFan (this is a separate sentiment/answer to “say more”, not directly related to gurdjieff)

2020-12-08 at 22:04:21: @_StevenFan i have seen stuff on TL about redefining work as play or what have you, and though playing around with different frames can be useful i question if it is the work itself that needs to be redefined or something separate/more fundamental

2020-12-08 at 22:02:18: @_StevenFan i am not entirely sure what the original sentiment implies, but i know gurdjieff has been rattling around in my brain, and he is explicit in calling his practice “work” https://t.co/583NM9fbeE

2020-12-08 at 21:59:25: also been reading pihkal and god i feel such deep kinship with and respect for alexander shulgin. he feels like a benevolent and infinitely wise yet deeply human grandfather figure

2020-12-06 at 23:15:42: @moothought i hope that with time you are able to become content with your relationship with your father. letting things take their course can be maddening. very happy to hear you are content with your relationship with your mom 💛

2020-12-06 at 23:11:36: (5) uncertainty in my own intrinsic value, a sense that i needed to prove myself to others for them for them to ascribe any value to me

2020-12-06 at 23:09:11: (4) lol i used to be afraid of driving, and there is far more depth to this than it seems

2020-12-06 at 23:07:20: (3) navigating independence &amp; growth while in a relationship. in a long term partnership you relinquish some amount of your individuality, and this is scary

2020-12-06 at 23:06:12: (2) will i ever be able to communicate authentically with my parents

2020-12-06 at 23:05:29: (1) the fragility of my physical body &amp; not paying enough attention to taking care of myself. am i neglecting my physical body, will i pay for this down the line, how do i fix this?

2020-12-06 at 23:01:04: a sampling of some of those fears, in case any resonate with you:

2020-12-06 at 22:55:42: i have lots more to say about this but am not sure what the right format is - thread, essay, just journal to crystallize thoughts in my own head, in conversation

2020-12-06 at 22:54:00: the past few months have been strangely amazing in helping me overcome many of my fears, and i think the next few months will bring more of the same. feeling very grateful for this

2020-12-06 at 22:44:12: the advice of “don’t date someone until you are content being single” is well intentioned but conflates longing for a partner with some form of personal inadequacy

2020-12-06 at 22:40:15: coming into yourself while in a long term romantic relationship is both possible and good

2020-12-06 at 22:37:51: every day i am grateful that at age seventeen i picked a field of study that grows more interesting to me with each passing day

2020-11-29 at 19:08:49: making this concrete: my cat got a rabies vaccine at the shelter a few years ago. his vet told me that cats who got this vaccine tend to get cancers at the injection site ~10 years down the line, he sees 3-4 such tumors a year in his small practice. must make sure vaccines r safe

2020-11-29 at 19:03:56: conceivably if there was a dataset of antigen, adjuvant, and side effects (might have to create dataset), you could create a model &amp; assess side effects of future vaccines. though idk how much info moderna etc give about vaccine composition

2020-11-29 at 19:02:02: also been wanting to do something similar for immunology, vaccines specifically, in advance of taking the vaccine. vaccines have two parts: antigen (thing you want immunity against) and adjuvant (thing that triggers immune response)

2020-11-29 at 19:00:44: first steps are (1) does something like this exist, hello literature, and (2) mess around with potential training data to get a sense of relationships between compound structure &amp; what we know about toxicity

2020-11-29 at 18:59:23: interested also in mechanism, ie what part of the brain/nervous system would the compound act on, what receptors are involved (or does the structure of compound in question imply a novel mechanism)

2020-11-29 at 18:57:11: want a neurotoxicology model/database i can query with various compounds (existing and novel) to assess their potential to be toxic

2020-11-29 at 09:32:04: @acidshill definitely more affectionate than what you describe in following tweet, i felt/feel very much like an older sister to my younger selves &amp; current self. like i'm gonna make sure you're okay, i got this.

2020-11-29 at 09:30:45: @acidshill !!! on last trip i had very similar insight

realized i contain all of my younger selves &amp; that i am capable of taking care of them with the wisdom i have now, and i know that my future self will take care of me

2020-11-29 at 09:12:22: continually unlearning moderation as a guiding value. moderation is good but it devalues what there is to be learned at the extremes of human experience. you learn so much in the process of testing your limits &amp; self-regulating

2020-11-28 at 01:58:04: @infinitsummer fully sober today but 2 weeks ago yes

2020-11-28 at 01:05:41: the way i see it VR is a first step towards fluid transfer of consciousness and next after that we can merge consciousnesses and wouldn’t that be the absolute fucking coolest

2020-11-28 at 01:04:30: i want to read about work at intersection of VR and neuroscience e.g. electrical feedback from brain guiding VR landscape, hit me with any papers

2020-11-28 at 01:03:26: VR is transfer of consciousness via optical stimulation (plus auditory stimulation, optional)

2020-11-28 at 00:56:44: why would u delay gratification when you could instead be constantly gratified

2020-11-28 at 00:19:54: do u think our hunter gatherer ancestors (a) bulked before the hunt or (b) did the hunt on a relatively empty stomach (which, presumably, prompted the hunt)

2020-11-27 at 23:35:35: @EggProphet strong sentimental attachment to the year 2008 bc that’s when i was officially declared cancer free :’)

2020-11-27 at 21:29:19: @krzhang waiting for the consolidated “drug store” where u go in and it’s like a bakery with each drug represented in a glass case, and u point and you’re like “5 tabs of the 200ug acid please”

2020-11-27 at 21:25:27: @krzhang yeah this is probably the simplest explanation, curious to see how enforcement changes with time. now i see you get your id checked upon entry to a dispensary vs with alcohol it’s typically you get it checked at the time of sale

2020-11-27 at 21:21:30: i’ve heard the US drinking culture is all about excess, canadian drinking culture is belligerent, and swiss drinking culture is controlled and generally good (these are the three drinking cultures i have heard about, feel free to educate me about your own)

2020-11-27 at 21:19:58: now of course the 21+ age limit in the US is silly and creates unhealthy attitudes towards drinking

2020-11-27 at 21:19:19: alcohol seems more dangerous than weed (more detrimental to health, more capacity for inciting violence/bad decisions) so shouldn’t liquor stores be more strict than dispensaries

2020-11-27 at 21:17:47: is it just because legal weed is a newer thing?

2020-11-27 at 21:16:44: honest question: why do dispensaries generally take enforcement of age restrictions more seriously than liquor stores?

2020-11-27 at 06:29:34: @philipggarland it’s a joke!

2020-11-27 at 02:21:34: @EggProphet thank you!! 2008 prius :’)

2020-11-27 at 02:19:43: bought my first car today :)

2020-11-25 at 21:22:02: @samgraver which canadian province yields the biggest people

2020-11-24 at 05:56:56: @philipggarland hm?

2020-11-24 at 05:56:44: @EggProphet i am so happy to hear that :’) 💗

2020-11-24 at 04:23:11: i am both the skeptic and the believer and so are you 🥰

2020-11-24 at 04:22:14: nothing quite like seeing a skeptic’s suspicion gradually and inevitably give way to whole-hearted belief

2020-11-24 at 01:57:38: @SellDips apparently people like to steal the catalytic converters inside of hybrid cars &amp; so you wanna have a shield or alarm system

2020-11-24 at 01:56:43: @SellDips i learned that toyota priuses got rear view cameras around ~2007 and that since 2018 rear view cameras have been mandatory in all cars sold in the US (though the mandate was declared in 2014, to give manufacturers some notice)

2020-11-24 at 01:55:10: @SellDips nothing strange per say, and i have to say at baseline i didn’t know much at all! but let’s see, i’ve been thinking hard about gas mileage, ability to resell, priuses as the quintessential californian car

2020-11-23 at 18:04:54: man i am learning a ton about cars in the process of buying a used car

2020-11-22 at 21:03:11: concept: information refractive index different between mind / pen and paper / computer

mind and computer more closely matched But computer lacks easy spatial cognition methods which pen and paper allows

2020-11-20 at 22:07:59: @cIass_man chaotic neutral

2020-11-20 at 22:05:57: @disconcerta i’m getting flashbacks to when bf and i visited my parents for tea and my mother sat us down in the living room and had us watch a whole friggin documentary about wim hof

2020-11-20 at 11:11:08: when holding hands to abdomen remembered that i used to be connected to my mom at my belly button and so through that channel i sent her some healing energy because i know the chemo is making her tired and frustrated despite her best efforts

2020-11-20 at 11:06:46: walked by mormon church and paused to fold hands and pay respect and felt a pulse of reiki energy so brought it to my abdomen to heal reproductive system &amp; store latent energy for later

2020-11-20 at 09:24:24: sometimes we have to fight with all we have for our happiness and that is okay too

2020-11-20 at 07:44:22: i want to lie on my stomach beside you - yes, you - in a field of grass and weave for you the best white clover flower crown i can manage

2020-11-20 at 07:14:51: @lilmaudlin hehe just some cells under a microscope

2020-11-20 at 07:08:02: i want to sit with you - yes, you! - on the carpeted floor of my bedroom and hear the story behind your full name

those particular socks were a gift from my mom and they say “you’re beautiful, don’t change”

2020-11-19 at 21:27:23: @willow_liana either use them religiously (regularly, barely even a rinse before sticking them in) or not at all (use as  a drying rack)

2020-11-19 at 10:00:09: @blisstweeting @kehwho tangential but must be said: blessed is the time when both phil and keh are up and tweeting 💗

2020-11-19 at 07:49:08: @kehwho yesterday bf was trying to pick a book to read and “get back into reading”. i told him to pick a book that makes him feel like a hot knife cutting through butter

2020-11-19 at 06:34:40: yes i like creating chaos but more importantly i refuse to allow people to feed themselves self-limiting beliefs. don't tell yourself the system is keeping you down and aid it in the process

2020-11-19 at 06:32:48: last time i pushed back on a point we spent half of the next class discussing the issue i had raised lol

2020-11-19 at 04:49:55: @nabeelqu loved the actionable points to improve thinking &amp; collaboration in biology plus some great references - have you read 'A Computer Scientist’s Guide to Cell Biology'? he mentions it and it looks great from a brief look

2020-11-19 at 04:47:35: @nabeelqu god what luminous writing! this essay was a joy to read &amp; wholly captures the wonderment of biology. 

first time coming across james somers too, seems he has a phenomenal reading list on his homepage that you may want to include on your site :) https://t.co/uN5EIK0JTR

2020-11-18 at 21:42:16: @jongold if you like the black but still want the white, celebrate the coming of spring by buying the white one

2020-11-18 at 21:41:13: @jongold gotta agree with hk on the black! also: with the weather getting colder, black will absorb more heat and can help you feel more resonant with the sun

2020-11-18 at 21:32:08: @CaYD4D to answer your question, the door was tall &amp; i am rather small (2 inches below american average female height)

2020-11-18 at 21:31:32: @moothought 🥰💗

2020-11-18 at 21:30:25: @AskYatharth i had seen the very first tweet in this thread (“is it possible to trip w/o drugs”) a few days ago without seeing the rest of it - curious about this trip-like experience you had as it compares to drug consumption, in motivation and nature

2020-11-18 at 21:28:30: @AskYatharth out of curiosity, would you do drugs in the future &amp; is there a specific reason you’ve never done them?

2020-11-18 at 21:23:20: @CaYD4D thank you, nathan, for asking the important questions

2020-11-18 at 20:19:17: @sokindling sf is like this too! have caught myself thinking similarly, why isn’t everywhere this colorful &amp; ornate?

2020-11-18 at 05:44:22: @krishkhubchand coincidentally i watched this youtube video just about an hour ago and think you'd enjoy it - essence is that minimizing twitter/social media offers your mind more idle space from which good things spring. lovely cinematography too but that's secondary

2020-11-17 at 17:39:21: my mom is quite opinionated in private - when she teaches she does not share political beliefs with her students - and her opinions used to grate on me. they make me smile in amusement now

2020-11-17 at 17:35:54: mom scoffed &amp; referred to newsom as “your governor” - does this mean i’ve made it as a californian?

2020-11-17 at 07:40:28: @azlenelza hey azlen! it's been two months now since you shared this, how have the learning groups shaken out - size, outcomes, etc?

2020-11-16 at 19:30:26: @willow_liana love your articulation of the nature of mastery, particularly that mastery is both ongoing and requires reverence for the thing being mastered (i thought of the self, in meditation)

2020-11-15 at 14:21:01: fyi the experience i had listening to that om namah shivaya is what i wish stimulants felt like to me - instead they leave me with a headache

2020-11-15 at 14:15:48: @nickcammarata i’m on pst and will be for a while now - i notice the lull starting at ~10-11pm PST and so i know 12am on i can be a lil wild

2020-11-15 at 14:13:59: @nickcammarata if (b), one approach to optimizing is syncing your schedule with the twitter hive mind consciousness

that way you keep unloading thoughts into here but its natural lulls can be when you feel emboldened to share stuff for which you’re unsure about its interesting-ness

2020-11-15 at 14:11:44: @nickcammarata are you optimizing: 
(a) the number of sentences you *write*
(b) the *resonance* of the sentences you write
(c) the *number* (this would indicate something i don’t quite understand)

2020-11-15 at 14:05:26: that’s them heading down with two empty pacificos iirc, but more importantly their conversational tone was much more palatable (net move towards unity) https://t.co/JJO6rTqWuy

2020-11-15 at 13:23:35: @acidshill you don’t have to be afraid of weakness of will - when you allow yourself to be susceptible (reframing of weakness of will). you know how materials can be para/diamagnetic - susceptibility has agency

2020-11-15 at 13:20:05: @acidshill (3.1) i’m not sure what your mental fabric / tapestry creation looks like when you trip. potentially: trip with me and i can guide you towards tapestry creation and analysis;;; my worldview doesn’t have fear of shadow, shadow illuminates and for that we must treasure it

2020-11-15 at 13:16:39: @acidshill (4) TBA - i will let u know what to do to integrate as i figure it out

2020-11-15 at 13:15:16: @acidshill (3) trip and have a great fucking time and come back to these things you’re afraid of / that are causing you discomfort in your life (i’m looking over at my list and all 6 have been more or less resolved - resolved insofar as i integrate the knowledge)

2020-11-15 at 13:12:55: @acidshill okay so:
(1) have a whiteboard in your bedroom (space you primarily occupy)
(2) a few days before trip write “here are the ways i feel blocked:” and write below whatever you feel, it’s okay if it feels mundane, as long as you experience the discomfort it causes you as u write

2020-11-15 at 08:16:23: holy fuck it’s starting &amp; started exactly 12h in

2020-11-15 at 08:14:25: i am excited and nervous for om namah shivaya because i know that kirtan version is extremely resonant

2020-11-15 at 07:05:16: @VecnanKrait i keep mentally returning to your thread on your experiences “speaking in tongues”

i think it gets at our human desire to perceive and embody something beyond ourselves

2020-11-15 at 05:52:00: funny that facebook messenger would roll out vanish mode just as i’m scrolling through my past messages trying to reconstruct my brain

2020-11-15 at 00:02:13: yea lol i’m still sitting here

2020-11-14 at 23:30:39: @isosteph you jest but i am feeling this right now on acid looking over the sunset district

2020-11-14 at 23:13:49: love that all my intuitions about myself were actually right

2020-11-14 at 22:00:34: technology is all a question of who can make the biggest “aum”

2020-11-14 at 21:49:23: a dozen people just walked by me single file somehow that was extremely resonant

2020-11-14 at 21:31:25: the kids making their way up the stairs, panting, i am you too! my heart beats fast every time i climb these stairs, no matter how much i’ve been exercising

2020-11-14 at 21:30:09: the awkward first date with the blond girl and spanish dude, the latter was carrying two pacifico’s in one hand

cringed at first but i have been anxious and hopeful at the promise of a new relationship but first we have to get past the awkward getting to know each other

2020-11-14 at 21:27:09: sitting outside near lots of passerby’s just filled with so much compassion for them because they are me

2020-11-14 at 21:17:38: om / aum is the sound of the universe and i hear it most frequently in the sound of our post industrial world - airplanes and lawnmowers and vacuums. serious question, where did our ancestors hear “aum” before electricity?

2020-11-14 at 21:10:28: i can look in the mirror and see my beauty and think to myself, i see my image identified with that of lakshmi and thus i have a portal to resonating with my own divinity

2020-11-14 at 21:09:35: i don’t really resonate with deities-as-divinity now, but to have lakshmi and durga and kali and saraswati embedded in the fabric of my mind is nice

2020-11-14 at 21:08:29: im grateful to have been raised with the notion of female goddesses

2020-11-14 at 02:52:35: @mosephos essence of my thinking is: do chloroplasts make energy in a way that is usable for humans, or does it require plant cell machinery to process chloroplast energy output

2020-11-14 at 02:51:39: @mosephos yes? - i’m more inclined to trust your word than mine, i’ve forgotten many of my pathways and cycles

2020-11-14 at 02:49:53: @bitcoin_eagle good point - i’m thinking photosynthesis as an energy boost not as a primary source of energy!

2020-11-13 at 22:54:37: for a brief stretch today i lost a little object i care about and i was able to speed past the despair to (1) quiet assurance i would find it, and (2) acceptance that if i didn’t find it, everything would be okay. i found it quite soon after i accepted the latter :)

2020-11-13 at 22:43:20: @diviacaroline first time i’m hearing of this book! i have to read this, nevermind that i am nowhere near the target audience of 8-12 year olds 😂 https://t.co/G10MdYsA9X

2020-11-13 at 22:27:46: @SellDips what kind of technique d’you think it’d be (rooted in some spiritual tradition, more lifestyle related, etc.) and what’s your sense of what we can do that’s “something like it”?

2020-11-13 at 22:26:03: @lilmaudlin oooh elaborate

2020-11-13 at 21:21:11: the question then is, is the energy (chemical compound) chloroplasts create usable for humans? similar enough to ATP?

2020-11-13 at 21:20:11: i mean, chloroplasts are just another organelle, there must be a way to express them in mammalian cells

2020-11-13 at 21:19:40: imagine if we (humans) could actually photosynthesize, wouldn’t that be incredible

2020-11-13 at 20:37:19: @isosteph imagine creamy butternut squash soup versus chunky butternut squash soup, one is clearly better, the immersion blender makes the difference

2020-11-13 at 20:36:07: @isosteph do u have an immersion blender bc if you do it can vastly level up your soup making abilities

2020-11-13 at 20:01:19: @breathofdesire_ ❤️❤️❤️

2020-11-13 at 19:57:40: @breathofdesire_ if you’re still feeling self conscious i want that to melt away

i want you to know that i am grateful to have access to - to be in the vicinity of - your energy ❤️

2020-11-13 at 19:54:17: @breathofdesire_ and the effort you put into this and the other one i saw! thank you so much for that

2020-11-13 at 19:53:35: @breathofdesire_ i find this exercise extremely admirable - anchoring your cognitive processing in local, physical sensation, and being as honest as you can. it represents things i’m working towards too: embodiment and authenticity

2020-11-13 at 19:51:49: @breathofdesire_ i was feeling a little far from my essence yesterday and i think you picked up on that. warmth and calmness is the goal &amp; is what i myself would like to perpetually be in touch with

2020-11-13 at 18:40:46: @breathofdesire_ :)

2020-11-13 at 15:09:41: used to believe much more strongly that everything - even “bad” things - happens for a reason

it used to be a calming, reflexive response whenever i was discontent with an outcome

i seem to have forgotten though in the past ~year and have to consciously tell myself this

2020-11-13 at 04:16:01: @gptbr00ke appreciate the clarification 😂

2020-11-13 at 04:15:28: @gptbr00ke haha no, “my life is a movie” to clean my room and now “Van Life” at my desk whilst working

2020-11-13 at 03:17:16: @EggProphet i will allow it

2020-11-13 at 02:09:10: soon there will come a winter day when i will be driving down the 5 to LA and i will be weary towards the middle-end of those 6 hours and, then, the opening notes of “blinding lights” will come through the stereo and suddenly the dreary evening will become electric and lively

2020-11-13 at 01:42:21: restless brain today, working to reign in my energy

2020-11-12 at 21:03:19: @breathofdesire_ love this sentiment

2020-11-12 at 03:25:14: she starts chemo tomorrow and i want to make sure she feels loved tonight and always

2020-11-12 at 03:24:26: just had a very nice video call with my mom, we were very much on the same wavelength :)

2020-11-12 at 02:23:18: i went on one (1) walk with one of bf’s friends in sf, months ago, and this guy’s genuine consideration of each thing i said &amp; slow, thought-out responses with no superficial social frills impact me to this day. i aspire towards his slowed-down, authentic way of conversation

2020-11-12 at 02:22:42: after i first choked out “i feel so lucky [to be with you]” to bf despite it feeling so silly to say out loud, i found myself more able to explicitly express the appreciation i felt towards my parents

2020-11-12 at 02:21:47: can’t get over how good interactions with other people are for figuring out how you, yourself, want to be

2020-11-12 at 01:13:23: @PrinceVogel related to posture: in the bhagavad gita the archer’s ready position is symbolic of meditation. do with that what you will. also when i meditate i try to tilt my head slightly skyward, feels like i’m more receptive to the universe that way

2020-11-11 at 23:29:32: this one too

eg GFP is ubiquitous now but let’s not forget it was isolated from a jellyfish first then expressed in all sorts of mammalian and bacterial cells

2020-11-10 at 11:05:44: @kehwho ooh i’ve found there r two states when i get flashbacks to nostalgic childhood things: (1) when my body feels worn (hungover, sick), (2) when i’m high

2020-11-10 at 09:06:47: iirc fMRI looks at blood flow as a proxy for brain function

how does scale of change in blood flow compare to scale of individual neurons firing? gonna guess 100x larger

2020-11-10 at 09:04:25: todo: deep dive into fMRI and fUS to (1) confirm understanding of mechanism, (2) identify contrast agents, (3) see what kind of studies they’ve been used in

2020-11-09 at 01:28:11: and this soaring conclusion on the integrability of individuality and community, and what is possible if we have both. concisely: we need one another to achieve great things. https://t.co/VIUuGT2HJe

2020-11-08 at 18:09:22: @QiaochuYuan @uncatherio i think the statement stands for anyone who has cared for you, be it another family member or a dear friend. as a paradigm, we can draw upon the way others have loved us to find ways of showing love to ourselves 💗

2020-11-08 at 08:24:52: @SellDips @isosteph nowhere will ever compare to my apartment with the wide south-facing window 😭

2020-11-07 at 22:04:07: to increase resonance with the universe begin by increasing your capacity for resonance with other people, even if they are (especially if they are) vibrationally far removed

2020-11-07 at 22:03:35: even if you disagree with their ethos you can find inspiration from their embodiment &amp; actions 😇

2020-11-07 at 22:00:06: feeling like i should be paying the side of the road hot dog stand for how good the sizzling meat and veggies smell as i walk by ... i may not be buying the good ($5 hot dog) but u are undeniably providing me a service

2020-11-07 at 00:05:18: @VecnanKrait this is fascinating, 

reminds me of how kuhn says that believers in the current scientific theory carry out experiments to probe that theory, which - counterintuitively - lay the groundwork for the disintegration of that theory &amp; the foundation for the next one

2020-11-03 at 05:40:02: oh my goodness acquaintance did a mike pence + fly couple’s costume

2020-11-01 at 23:54:30: hello, sharks. i’m matilda and today i am seeking freedom through action

2020-11-01 at 23:01:01: @questionaware thank u for clarifying i was unsure for a second

2020-11-01 at 22:53:43: that is True Love

2020-11-01 at 22:53:29: those you love will never use your vulnerability against you

2020-11-01 at 22:51:43: security in love is knowing that expressing vulnerability will only yield positive downstream outcomes

2020-11-01 at 22:49:01: @sadalsvvd u really just called out younger me

2020-11-01 at 22:47:08: @sadalsvvd that being said, NaTw50000WoMo seems like a far more attainable goal ;)

2020-11-01 at 22:46:18: @sadalsvvd when i was younger i always considered doing NaNoWriMo but knew the guilt of not achieving the goal would inhibit the experience of joy of the process

2020-11-01 at 22:43:29: we are all driven by undercurrents that we may or may not be aware of. we act in ways that sometimes align, sometimes are counter to those undercurrents. misalignment of action causes psychic dissonance &amp; creates distance between us and others, and us and ourselves

2020-11-01 at 22:40:59: so excited that both are paths i can actively pursue en route to my ultimate goal of seeing through to the essence of everything

2020-11-01 at 22:39:36: two ways to go about understanding the essence of things:

(1) the direct, scientific thinking route, pursue by continually refining thinking
(2) the indirect, diffuse way of seeking joy and perception of what cannot be perceived (via meditation, drugs, peak experiences)

2020-10-29 at 19:12:25: when you are grasping for clarity in your writing and it seems just out of reach - look at your previous sentence and ensure that any parallelism has been carried through the present sentence

2020-10-29 at 18:36:03: @_StevenFan i can see the discomfort arising from the idea of creating an institution, though, and perhaps this aligns more with your feelings

2020-10-29 at 18:35:22: @_StevenFan i’ve noticed a similar discomfort! for me it stems from a sense of, who am i to teach anyone when i haven’t got it figured out yet?

kehwho n rival voices are two key counterexamples in my mind, shitposting their way to enlightenment &amp; taking us with them

2020-10-29 at 16:22:59: @lilmaudlin i guess a full kitchen across the hall is better than a kitchenette in what is supposed to be an adult’s apartment

2020-10-29 at 16:22:17: @lilmaudlin acquaintance went to see an apt where the kitchen was literally a separate room across the hall (photos did not indicate this)

https://t.co/rWmITyESii

2020-10-29 at 01:41:14: @CountJ0ecool it's an ongoing process, hard to place myself right now. i think i've become to enamored with my semi-contrarian narrative &amp; have begun to identify a bit too much with that

2020-10-29 at 00:32:43: @cIass_man this is my fav genre of class man tweets

2020-10-28 at 23:54:33: in response to my full potential not being acknowledged, i will discuss this in a 1x1 &amp; also reconnect to my own passion for the work, thereby addressing this both @ work and in my own brain

2020-10-28 at 23:53:10: so in response to being alienated i will invest into my nascent relationships &amp; create a community i love, fuck that fake community, i didn’t want you anyways

2020-10-28 at 23:52:23: upset bc:

- lack of community (alienated from community)
- not being used to my full potential @ work even though i have repeatedly asked for more involvement &amp; responsibility

2020-10-28 at 01:40:36: @vidythatte perhaps girls are more organized thinkers *but* the organization inhibits creativity

2020-10-28 at 01:39:45: @vidythatte i find girls tend to qualify their ideas more / pad relevant statements with  friendly comments &amp; personally diminishing comments

2020-10-28 at 01:35:03: maybe it’s the difference between feeling confident &amp; not feeling confident when trying to generate new ideas [confounding variable]

2020-10-27 at 23:09:15: @harveykrishna_ hey i'm glad you shared this, i'm going through something similar. you sharing this does not detract from your vibrant, mystical, and thoughtful twitter persona. in fact it adds nuance &amp; realism. sending strength, maybe we can find a way to help each other &lt;3

2020-10-27 at 22:45:06: @goblinodds @katrenmet @braverius So like 5-6 / 27 resonate. Hope this is a useful data point!

2020-10-27 at 22:44:20: @goblinodds @katrenmet @braverius (10) Ya to “Do you have a built-in ‘BS detector’ and despise playing along with things that infantilize you?” and “Do you need to understand the purpose of a task?”
(13) Yes to all the driving-related stress
(19) Yes, this feels extremely normal
(24) Sorta, but this seems normal

2020-10-27 at 22:44:04: @goblinodds @katrenmet @braverius (2) Yes to “Does eye contact make it harder to think clearly?”
(5) Yes to “Do your anxiety levels spike when there is a change of plans”, this feels normal

2020-10-27 at 22:36:18: @goblinodds @katrenmet @braverius i'm on it will report back

2020-10-27 at 21:33:45: @kehwho do u have thread / fav tweets on your conception of masculine and feminine? would love to read &amp; understand your beliefs

2020-10-26 at 18:42:16: @uncatherio @eigenrobot necessary context 2: https://t.co/c1y4Nm5VO9

2020-10-26 at 18:41:48: @uncatherio @eigenrobot necessary context 1: https://t.co/DLu84I103p

2020-10-26 at 18:40:31: @uncatherio @eigenrobot i so want a family but discourse around families is too often framed starting from “woman carries child”, which doesn’t work for me &amp; has far more nuance, as you outline

2020-10-26 at 18:38:23: @uncatherio @eigenrobot as a woman who cannot bear children, i find your distinction between “people who can get pregnant” / “primary caregiver” / and other such roles extremely helpful

2020-10-26 at 18:35:41: @uncatherio @eigenrobot only up to opinion 19 but holy heck! i love your thinking!

2020-10-26 at 18:23:16: @selentelechia still getting calls for “Tia” and it’s been 10 years here

2020-10-26 at 07:30:03: @eigenrobot with that context: i’m pessimistic about academia as an institution but

i’m looking fwd to phd! excited to gain certain skills that’d be hard to gain elsewhere

2020-10-26 at 07:28:23: @eigenrobot then i learned to trust my internal barometer (you’re doing enough, you’re doing good work!) rather than external sources of validation (conferences, publications) along with other catalytic experiences

2020-10-26 at 07:27:33: @eigenrobot i used to have aspirations to do a phd then a postdoc and then get a tenure track faculty position by age ~30, all at name brand institutions. kinda crazy looking back on those days

2020-10-26 at 05:16:52: @Virtual1nstinct @selentelechia at least wollstonecraft is fun to read! she has such a strong voice

2020-10-26 at 05:02:23: @selentelechia have u read wollstonecraft’s vindication of the rights of woman? she has much to say about him &amp; in general i found it be an empowering read

2020-10-26 at 04:40:00: @eigenrobot i'll prob be more vocal about anti-ccp views

2020-10-26 at 04:36:27: @qorprate (we only want the best for u snav, enjoy and stay safe out there (in there?) &lt;3)

2020-10-26 at 04:32:43: wondering if i knew any of you in a previous life

2020-10-26 at 04:18:38: @goblinodds thank god bf is off twitter atm, as you know height diff is the EXACT SAME

2020-10-25 at 23:50:36: @VecnanKrait @infinitsummer happy to make your acquaintance :))

2020-10-25 at 23:47:54: @itsLuciKeller 💛💛

2020-10-25 at 23:17:47: @VecnanKrait @infinitsummer not so much a rec but just wanted to say that your pinned tweet &amp; its sincerity was part of the inspiration for writing out my story and putting it on here (thread linked) https://t.co/qGWyE0BuQG

2020-10-25 at 19:29:32: @goblinodds okay i don’t get a pop but sometimes i sit down and i have intense pain in one hip socket that isn’t relieved until i stand up ... happened in a formal zoom call recently and i was in agony

2020-10-25 at 19:02:07: i just want you guys to know that my hair looks great today

2020-10-25 at 14:27:21: i keep coming back to this tweet because it so concisely expresses a complex feeling that [i think] is difficult to relate to &amp; understand https://t.co/QbjZ8WglFn

2020-10-25 at 14:24:31: @breathofdesire_ @typicalTyper i did think that was an important distinction, i’m glad you picked up on it :)

2020-10-25 at 14:19:50: to borrow steinbeck’s phrase, it is best to “speak nakedly”

2020-10-25 at 14:19:19: big fan of plainly stated ideas that resonate, over jargon. best to define and delineate your thinking to be accessible to a layperson capable of critical thought

2020-10-25 at 14:13:30: @breathofdesire_ @typicalTyper maybe making a list of “must-haves” informed by the pain/missteps of prior relationships would be a useful practice for you?

2020-10-25 at 14:12:50: @breathofdesire_ @typicalTyper i made a list of traits i was looking for in a partner based on the failed relationships i’d had in the past. when my partner came along he quickly checked off those boxes and then exceeded my wildest expectations.

2020-10-25 at 09:36:10: @nibrasibn @SchmirCampaign of course, hope it’s an easy fix!

2020-10-25 at 09:23:13: @SchmirCampaign @nibrasibn also getting this when i click on the link &amp; also v interested in reading!

2020-10-25 at 07:39:15: ultimately: i want you to be able to accept your deep pain &amp; maybe even use it as a conduit for something greater. we’re all hurting and yet we are all vibrantly alive

2020-10-25 at 07:38:46: the thought - “it is not mutually exclusive to be well-adjusted and yet to carry deep pain” - occurred to me in the shower this evening and struck a chord. before this thought i viewed acceptance of pain as rejection of the joy &amp; success in my life.

2020-10-25 at 07:37:56: i treasure the feeling of being close to my essence &amp; as such i am oddly grateful for this deep pain. as the name implies, deep pain is about as close to the core of my being as anything can be.

2020-10-25 at 07:37:18: having others (hi babe) validate this is helpful

2020-10-25 at 07:36:44: for this deep pain, crying feels like a valid response to a genuine loss of control.

2020-10-25 at 07:35:58: and i cry and for the first time in my life i’m finding crying feels genuinely therapeutic. when i cry for other reasons i get in my head and say, why are you crying, get yourself together &amp; complete actions that will relieve the emotional burden.

2020-10-25 at 07:34:14: i’ve discovered a new and, ironically, life-affirming way of engaging with this deep pain. my mom’s cancer has made me very aware of my lack of control &amp; so i lean into this lack of control &amp; accept that all that is causing me pain is indeed very hard and very sad.

2020-10-25 at 07:33:04: when i am sad about transient things i draw upon this deep pain in an opportunistic way, to make myself more sad and perversely so. it’s not pretty. those trains of thought are just awful.

2020-10-25 at 07:31:29: in my daily life i tend to float above these sources of pain, choosing instead to focus on transient stress and tasks. it is impractical to always engage with this pain: how would i get anything done?

2020-10-25 at 07:30:36: i try to calm my mind but i find mentions of fertility, family planning, and pregnancy a little difficult

2020-10-25 at 07:29:37: under all this hope and determination, is fear and pain. though i am happy for expecting parents, i am reminded that there is a chance that i will not be able to experience motherhood in the way that i wish to.

2020-10-25 at 07:28:27: it won’t be easy and it isn’t possible at this moment, but i will not give up hope.

2020-10-25 at 07:28:05: mind you, i haven’t given up on having biological children. i am a scientist by trade and i believe science will enable me to have biological children, whether it be through (1) ovarian stem cells differentiated into eggs, or (2) skin cells reprogrammed into eggs.

2020-10-25 at 07:27:21: realistically, my body is very functional; i can run, jump, and do all the things except, evidently, create life. 

i aspire towards an intuitive mastery of my body &amp; the dysfunction of my reproductive system feels like a big barrier to that, but that’s an aside.

2020-10-25 at 07:26:52: i try not to think about this (this is my reality!) but sometimes the pain resurfaces.

i have a general, painful sense that my body is dysfunctional &amp; that i haven’t a clue how to fix it.

2020-10-25 at 07:24:18: but at age 15 i was told that i would not be able to have children of my own, because of the chemo i got when i was 3. the chemo, apparently, did a number on my reproductive system. i have never had a menstrual cycle without the aid of synthetic hormones (see message to friend). https://t.co/UC8PsCvW8M

2020-10-25 at 07:23:13: i have my maternal grandmother’s eyes and every time i look into her eyes it is soul-affirming.

2020-10-25 at 07:23:02: when the time is right i want our home to be filled with our children’s cries and laughter. i want to make my mother a grandmother and to see her hold her grandchild and see herself in that little human.

2020-10-25 at 07:22:15: my body has grown to be the strong and feminine body of a young adult. my body and mind are lucky to be loved by a wonderful man. i can still scarcely believe i found someone as perfect as he is for me: physically, intellectually, in affectations, in outlook.

2020-10-25 at 07:21:41: i am scared of losing my mom (though realistically i know she will make it through this) but more than that my heart hurts thinking of the pain her little 4’11” body has undergone and will undergo. i am certain her heart hurt in the same way for my little 3 year old body.

2020-10-25 at 07:21:09: my mom underwent a harsh surgery just over a month ago as a first step in treating the cancer. she is now preparing to start chemo. her oncologist said: 3 month course, then a maintenance dose as high as your body can handle for years. years?

2020-10-25 at 07:19:18: among other things, the yearly ecg to see if and how the chemo has weakened my heart.

2020-10-25 at 07:18:33: ironically, for most of my life, this has not caused me much pain. the pain has come more recently. 

my mom’s cancer diagnosis has thrust cancer into the forefront of my mind after years of only being aware of cancer as far as its tendrils: the long term effects i face.

2020-10-25 at 07:17:13: concretely, my cancer was a nasty ordeal. i was diagnosed at age 3 and it came back twice, necessitating more aggressive treatment each time. it is against the backdrop of cancer that i remember my childhood, that i had my first memories.

2020-10-25 at 07:15:35: i think, in a silly way, i’m reluctant to mention my history with cancer because it’s kind of the ace up my sleeve. it’s what makes me “different and special”.

2020-10-25 at 07:14:54: childhood cancer is not something that comes up in casual conversation. i bring it up and people’s faces fall. they tell me i am strong. i think, i barely knew what was happening to me. my parents are the strong ones.

2020-10-25 at 07:14:24: the pain from a recent thing i cannot control (mom’s cancer diagnosis) has reignited the pain from a thing that happened to me as a child (cancer)

2020-10-25 at 07:13:53: i had a wonderful childhood. my parents are beautiful people who raised me well. there are of course things we don’t see eye to eye on but on the whole, they modeled a healthy relationship &amp; loved me intensely (they still do!)

2020-10-25 at 07:13:15: i’ve avoided talking about these things as they have occurred in my life, but i am going to delve into them a bit:

2020-10-25 at 07:11:18: kind of a bummer that by the time i got my thoughts together everyone is asleep but i’ll have faith that anyone who is meant to see my thoughts will see them

2020-10-25 at 07:10:16: two sources of deep pain in life are

(1) things we cannot control, like a loved one’s cancer diagnosis or violent unrest in your homeland across the world

(2) the bad things that *happened to you* before you had agency (childhood) or things that stole your agency (e.g. assault)

2020-10-25 at 07:09:26: it is not mutually exclusive to be well-adjusted and yet to also carry deep pain. i recently realized this for myself &amp; i’d wager that this is the case for most people ... 🧵

unfortunately not. my cat actually loves nibbling at plants but i think this is far too large a task for him &amp; grass isn’t that good for cats anyways!

i don’t think i’ve fully conveyed to you how much [sensitive topic] affects me

2020-10-23 at 09:26:26: i don’t *need* affirmations expressed in words; i can *feel* intention. reiki is a good example of the latter &amp; i think i’ll be doing more of it going forward

2020-10-23 at 09:25:03: to some extent you could say christianity and latin, maybe?

2020-10-23 at 09:24:36: theory:

2020-10-22 at 02:18:16: @earthlypath oh good to know! i am mostly culturally hindu, happy to be corrected

why would krishna not be considered an avatar due to his prominence in the gita?
i.e. is he considered a god in his own right, or, oppositely, not a deity?

2020-10-22 at 02:11:45: (4) in the first chapter of the bhagavad gita (scripture), members of opposing armies are described in detail. but each person is symbolic of a different trait within a single person’s mind!

so the war that ensues is really all a metaphor for your psyche!!!

2020-10-22 at 02:05:56: @harveykrishna_ considered tagging u but knew you’d find it you omnipotent being 😛

2020-10-22 at 02:04:51: christians i’ve interacted with are so good at praying for every facet of a situation, naming each explicitly

e.g. bf’s mom did a better job of praying for my mom before surgery than i did! i had general sentiment of “pls let her be ok” but bf’s ma went so much broader/deeper

2020-10-22 at 02:02:02: how to intuitively come up with authentic, explicit affirmations/invocations/manifestations if i didn’t learn how to pray growing up ??

2020-10-22 at 01:53:01: (3.1) but wait, the plot thickens! turns out KRISHNA is actually one of the 24 avatars of VISHNU https://t.co/89MeX0oHRV

but they are all manifestations of the same divine feminine,
who is turn is part of a greater all-encompassing divine

2020-10-22 at 01:25:41: a thing i love about hindu concepts is their collapsibility and interdependence

e.g. ...🧵

2020-10-22 at 01:18:20: realized i can put my whole heart into saying “i love god” but thinking of the phrase as “i love God” restricts that feeling

2020-10-22 at 00:30:52: toastmasters for storytelling

2020-10-22 at 00:30:13: i think humans used to be a lot better at storytelling but storytelling is a bit of a lost art

a lost art that’s worth reclaiming

2020-10-22 at 00:27:35: so what do you do in between?

2020-10-22 at 00:26:54: as far as opportunities to narrativize, i think of two extremes:  

(1) college application period of life
(2) telling your life story to your grandkids

2020-10-22 at 00:25:49: but i’m inclined to think that occasional narrativizing is good. writing a personal statement is a clear opportunity to narrativize, but i think there are fewer opportunities to write such statements as you progress through life

2020-10-22 at 00:23:39: for that reason i tend to avoid talking about my dreams and goals. don’t want false joy. don’t want false joy i haven’t earned through action

2020-10-22 at 00:22:57: there was a study that showed that talking about your dreams/goals released feel good neurotransmitters

actually executing your dreams/goals often has a period of discomfort/antipathy before the good feelings come through

2020-10-22 at 00:21:16: but of course life is not just your accomplishments, life is experienced at much higher resolution, in your daily practices and in your passing interactions and in those conversations with friends that electrify you

2020-10-22 at 00:20:07: the continuity is not always evident but it became evident as i refined the statement and somehow i feel close to my essence. i feel that i am good and that i am living this life as i should

‘living this life’ ~= accomplishing things i’m proud of

2020-10-22 at 00:18:32: at times in the past i’ve found narrativizing my life to be actively Not Good and so in general i’ve tried to stay away from doing as such

but i finished writing a personal statement today and it felt so good to encapsulate my experiences in a narrative

2020-10-22 at 00:08:39: @rbbrbrrn okay i think this is something i have trouble with on here too! 

it is a totally foreign concept to me to intentionally express a sentiment in an inflammatory or unkind way

2020-10-21 at 23:57:43: emboldened to tastefully hornypost due to influence of @harveykrishna_ and @Virtual1nstinct

2020-10-21 at 23:56:12: switching between texting bf, dad, and best friend, marginally worried i will accidentally sext one of the latter two

2020-10-21 at 23:14:43: last thing you got deeply interested in and consumed all the info u could on it?

2020-10-21 at 16:18:14: bf is good at both writing and science and i have exploited the heck out of that

2020-10-21 at 16:16:56: engineering/humanities friend hit on thematic flow

2020-10-21 at 16:16:03: political science friend hitting on the nuances of my phrasing

2020-10-21 at 16:15:23: realized the last time i wrote a significant application i was pretty reliant on my parents for feedback, nice to realize i now have a lil network of friends who are happy to read and comment and provide their complimentary expertises 🥰

2020-10-20 at 22:30:41: @gptbr00ke frankly i am so bogged down by deadlines and stress at this moment that i am finding it hard to kindle passion - this of course will pass

2020-10-20 at 20:49:50: i want pastry but i cannot afford to take a pastry acquisition break right now. send me your most carbohydrate laden positive energy

2020-10-20 at 05:39:45: @harveykrishna_ oh yes based on a quick google search that looks about right. the graphics are quite pretty

2020-10-20 at 05:32:39: i know next to nothing about video games, do any of you know which one this is? https://t.co/g7l3VpsD5D

2020-10-20 at 05:31:33: based on the sounds i hear from the living room, i can only surmise that my roommate is simultaneously (1) playing a video game, (2) watching circuits lectures, and (3) watching the office

2020-10-20 at 03:12:27: honestly the post-submission euphoria is going to be So good i don’t even know if i’ll need to consume any other substances to elevate my mood for celebration

2020-10-20 at 03:11:37: will celebrate by getting utterly smashed. schmacked. fucked Up. crunk. lit

2020-10-20 at 03:06:41: typically i don’t like attaching my happiness to a specific milestone but guys ... when i finish this application ..... i am going to be the happiest person in the world

2020-10-19 at 21:31:33: @PigeonFeatherz @rbbrbrrn kinda wild that pregnancy over the age of 35 is called a ‘geriatric pregnancy’ when end of fertility is more like 10 years later

does make sense considering risk for chromosomal abnormalities/ other complications increases w age, but do wonder if risk blown outta proportion

2020-10-19 at 21:30:00: @PigeonFeatherz @rbbrbrrn good point, thanks for sharing!

2020-10-19 at 19:18:28: @qorprate @exotericist @harveykrishna_ example of this framing in screenshot https://t.co/krdWWi1OjK

2020-10-19 at 19:17:54: @qorprate @exotericist @harveykrishna_ tangential: i have a friend who is excellent at advice, and one thing she does is listen to my specific issues &amp; then frame them as being general things that humans experience

this seems like a way of "knowing better" about life/social world, but tempered with good listening

2020-10-19 at 19:03:19: @qorprate @exotericist @harveykrishna_ here to say forms of "knowing better" can be good/admirable/energizing

one example that comes to mind is my mom in the quoted tweet
https://t.co/QkgtRpQJK6

2020-10-19 at 18:57:59: @rbbrbrrn would you say that's the case for friends in relationships &amp; single friends alike?

2020-10-19 at 18:45:04: @rbbrbrrn (2) are facts around fertility not common knowledge... e.g. women are typically fertile til age 38 +/- a few years, as maternal age increases pregnancy becomes higher risk

2020-10-19 at 18:43:52: @rbbrbrrn the two divergent thoughts that come to mind are:

(1) it is stunning to me how casually many of my female friends treat birth control. i've had to have a few convos where i'm like - wait, you do realize that you're putting a bunch of hormones into your body, right?

2020-10-19 at 18:42:20: @rbbrbrrn what specifically do you think people need to know more about? i.e. how has culture failed people? 

there seems to be a bit of a disconnect in my experiences, in that my impression is people are relatively aware of fertility/family planning

2020-10-19 at 04:23:05: @xiexiexiexiex @ThisEpoch im leading the cause to ban snow in october

2020-10-19 at 02:29:34: (3) i always forget how good physical exertion feels 

once i’m done exerting myself, there’s a waiting period as my body cools down - and then, there is no feeling quite as good as basking in the endorphins

2020-10-19 at 02:00:04: jogging up hills for the booty gains, jogging down hills for the bone density gains

2020-10-18 at 04:40:22: this is me mucking around in semantics when i really just need to hammer down my experimental design 😅

2020-10-18 at 04:32:01: is it redundant to begin a sentence with “conceivably,” because by virtue of articulating your thought, must it not already be conceivable?

2020-10-18 at 02:17:06: if you see a small person with a high ponytail walking around the sunset district angrily muttering about e. coli, that’s me

2020-10-17 at 06:28:04: @ThisEpoch all jokes aside this is a great question and i’d like to take a stab at answering when i’m capable of gathering and synthesizing thought

2020-10-15 at 04:02:27: @cIass_man fun fact feng shui has an indian analogue called vastu shastra, both of which deal with the proper organization of spaces &amp; architecture

2020-10-15 at 04:01:04: @cIass_man yes i’m thinking maybe more common in asian cultures (india and china for sure). wonder if this is a thing in south america, africa, or indigenous cultures

2020-10-14 at 22:13:11: e.g. i am forbidden to wear diamonds and emeralds, due to the guidance of the family astrologer

2020-10-14 at 22:11:43: is it part of your culture/upbringing to be extremely intentional about the stones you wear?

2020-10-14 at 06:16:33: this is one i've been thinking about since i took the test ~2 weeks ago. i've noticed i enter a higher state perhaps once every 2-3 weeks, where insights and realizations flow and connect in a powerful way https://t.co/b6H0QIciHs

2020-10-14 at 06:14:02: i took an mbti test for the first time in a while, for fun. don't remember my result. rather, the valuable takeaways were the questions in which i saw myself reflected: https://t.co/aELEBmxfp0

2020-10-14 at 06:01:53: some things that energize me:

- science ideation sessions where i bring my domain expertise + realism, &amp; they bring their domain expertise + complimentary personal traits
- overcoming activation energy
- intuitively acting in alignment with my values
- finding new mental frames

2020-10-14 at 05:54:39: @ConnorFlexman this is apt. you've made it past reconciliation, or would you characterize it as an ongoing process?

[can mimetic desire be vanquished for once and for all?]

2020-10-14 at 05:52:50: @ConnorFlexman lovely, there's a whole field of compost engineering!

https://t.co/RS6fhnLvOO

2020-10-14 at 05:52:21: @ConnorFlexman oh yes critical mass &amp; relevant microbes are good points. i know with wastewater treatment "activated sludge" consists of microbes which break down various chemicals. i'd imagine there's something similar for compost sites

2020-10-14 at 05:48:27: some of my interests:
 
- doing science right: proper hypothesis &amp; study construction
- biology (protein eng, etc) 
- mind-altering substances [experiencing them]
- mind-altering substances [theory of &amp; others' writing]
- priming &amp; channeling intuition
- becoming spiritual https://t.co/zbfVOM8OdF

2020-10-13 at 21:21:10: nascent theory: markets serve as an additional check and balance to the government

example: barrett allegedly anti-ivf, but demand and use case of ivf (allowing people to become parents!) would supersede anti-ivf legislation

2020-10-13 at 20:46:38: truly takes a village to raise a child, where "raising a child" means "me writing my entire predoctoral fellowship application in this coming week" and "village" comprises the 3+ people who i've roped into looking it over for me

2020-10-09 at 07:04:21: - is agricultural demand for compost based fertilizer that strong?

2020-10-09 at 07:03:54: if compostable items (food scraps, paper towels) decay on their own anyways, why separate them? they’ll eventually stop taking up space at landfill

2020-10-08 at 14:29:02: @angelhoneycomb why are you scared when people are kind to you? 

i.e.
is this a general principle?
what could it be rooted in?

2020-10-08 at 13:45:28: (1) my dread surrounding a task is directly proportional to the extent of the mismatch between
how long i subconsciously know it will take
and what time i have consciously allotted

though, once i see and accept the subconscious, i’m eventually able to turn dread into enjoyment

2020-10-08 at 13:42:55: patterns i notice in myself:

2020-10-08 at 13:26:34: i think i finally understand those why profs assign those problems with so many friggin sub parts (or perhaps i finally have a prof who’s doing it right)

by q2g i feel pretty good about my ability to apply this technique to other cases (if only the dang integral would work)

2020-10-06 at 19:05:42: and so now as i occupy this happy medium of sleep deprivation, i will attempt to be extra conscious of how my body feels today

2020-10-06 at 19:04:36: well rested brain of course leads to well rested body, but i am not as aware of this connection when everything is good and functional

2020-10-06 at 19:03:08: hungover brain -&gt; hungover stiff achy body

2020-10-06 at 19:02:33: well rested brain &gt; sleep deprived brain &gt;&gt;&gt; hungover brain

2020-10-06 at 17:50:30: hard to reconcile:

"make better use of women's minds"
(1) gives no power to the individual - what does the woman want to do with her mind? 
(2) but also asserts that there is untapped value in women's minds (when historically women have been written off as irrational, illogical)

2020-10-06 at 17:47:39: okay okay getting a sense that communist/socialist societies have historically advocated for gender equality, based on reading about valentina tereshkova &amp; some exposure to friction between confucianism/communism (zedong essays) https://t.co/gPcFphXBYc

2020-10-04 at 04:56:05: ugh feeling that “it’s a saturday night i wanna be around people” energy
like fomo but i don’t know enough people here to know what i’d be missing out on
feels like being a freshman in college again and panicking about not having the hookup to get into a frat party

2020-10-03 at 02:34:13: i’m also motivated to create routines not just for myself, but to fit into the larger social structure of the house, 
e.g. have a predictable nighttime routine (something i’ve always wanted) so that my roommates know what to expect from me

2020-10-03 at 02:33:01: moved to new place just a few days ago but this place and its inhabitants are already having a huge impact on me, making me think of:

- the value of community
- unity in action in a romantic relationship
- the joy of a clean living space

follow up q’s/thoughts:
1) what do you use cumin in?
2) i’ve smelled smoked paprika once and it was heavenly. do you ever use normal paprika?
3) my +1 to this list would be fennel seeds. they add a lil sweetness and are great for digestion lol

2020-09-22 at 18:08:47: like in science there are different interpretations of results and sure they resonate differently depending on your background and knowledge and inclinations
but resonance of an idea as a proxy for its accuracy seems wrong

2020-09-22 at 18:07:44: offered an explanation in [history/humanities] class today and prof said “well yes that’s an explanation that resonates with you, there are many other explanations [proceeds to describe the explanation she wrote about in her thesis]”

2020-09-22 at 04:43:40: two explanations come to mind:
(1) i haven’t properly addressed those negative feelings that came to the surface and so they were rife to appear
or
(2) brain leapt upon opportunity to wallow in negativity

2020-09-22 at 04:42:25: reluctant to share because i don’t want to seem emotionally volatile but 
why is it that one recent negative interaction had a domino effect and surfaced other negative feelings, making my mental waters tumultuous?

2020-09-22 at 02:38:36: if i feel good now, i can't wait to see how i feel as i start taking better care of my physical body: sleeping properly, eating better, and exercising

i’ve been avoiding bringing him - keeping him w parents - bc of uncertainty in career/school

2020-09-19 at 06:06:48: @cIass_man ah
(1) all those are physical [not related to mental faculties] things, what are grounds for 'worry'
(2) what benefit would it have if the press discussed her health (other than create pressure for her to resign)? (since when has media coverage lent itself to genuine discourse?)

2020-09-19 at 05:57:54: @cIass_man i honestly didn't realize how ill she was. i vaguely remember hearing once of her calling in and adjudicating from a hospital bed, but i assumed it was temporary.

to communicate with other committee member(s) you just select their name and send a private chat rather than waiting for a handwritten note to be delivered

2020-09-18 at 03:58:51: but i think trying psychedelics might also help with the elimination of the spokes;

2020-09-18 at 03:56:51: happiness comes from peace

2020-09-18 at 03:56:36: ideally the board (my mind) should be absent of spokes. thoughts and emotions should just glide on down.

meditation, conscious effort to let go of things, occupying myself with action, avoiding procrastination - have all helped me and will continue to

2020-08-24 at 21:52:23: grateful that i am a woman and clothing/accessories are a socially acceptable way to explore embodiment

2020-08-24 at 21:48:25: i did not grow up around mountains

2020-08-24 at 21:48:14: holy long sleeve athletic moisture wicking shirt made by a subsidiary of columbia with ‘mountain’ in the name, evoking mountains in my memory and the people and places and times i’ve encountered them

2020-08-24 at 21:41:50: my dreams last night: engaging in-person conversation with celine h; mom gave me a terrible haircut; i worked on building a small mri at a government lab and was applauded in the hallway &amp; bonded with another woman wearing a pastel long sleeve shirt

2020-08-24 at 21:37:34: feeling super embodied wearing an external symbol of my faith (earrings w my equivalent of a cross)

2020-08-24 at 21:06:35: my belief: experiences that make you aware of mortality always have an unexpected positive side (i.e. silver lining)

2020-08-24 at 20:58:36: @isosteph fuck it’s me i’m guy

2020-08-24 at 04:39:19: @yokaihainen obsessed with the first blue-tinged photo

2020-08-24 at 04:35:50: @patbokonon sleep well x!

2020-08-24 at 03:12:23: RT @max_hodak: Also by “found homes with employees” I mean I now have two kittens.

2020-08-23 at 22:57:47: feeling lots of positive social energy and it’s cool i can later quantify &amp; analyze by looking at calls and messages and pictures (digital record)

2020-08-23 at 22:51:39: holy hell my friends are fantastic

2020-08-23 at 21:56:18: @CompAesthetics @xiexiexiexiex

2020-08-22 at 23:14:51: @gptbr00ke @Aella_Girl just thought of you and your theories about eye contact :)

2020-08-22 at 23:01:16: @Aella_Girl @gptbr00ke

2020-08-22 at 23:00:24: how do i feel the love i feel for my partner, the appreciation i feel for my friends, for my mom

2020-08-22 at 22:59:20: my theory is that my twitter sphere is mostly between ages 20-30 and every year in between those two extremes is massively significant

therefore i feel super ‘behind’ when really i just need to keep living and i will inevitably catch up in 1-2-3 years

2020-08-22 at 22:56:49: i don’t know how to be a good daughter

2020-08-22 at 22:55:57: i want her to be around forever

2020-08-22 at 22:55:43: i think in my struggle for independence, coming from a strict upbringing, i somehow forgot how much i love my mom

2020-08-22 at 22:50:43: thinking about lana del rey controversy a lil while ago lol

2020-08-22 at 22:50:25: a person can do a bad thing and still be a good person 

just as a person can do a good thing and still be a bad person

2020-08-22 at 22:49:57: cancel culture turns good people into villains

2020-08-21 at 05:57:36: @JohnStall17 @cIass_man ha we both leaped to define immoral as a big old no

2020-08-21 at 05:56:34: @cIass_man depends on what kind of roommate trouble imo - if you think roommate is *fundamentally* not a good person then no. 

otherwise, in spirit of being kind to everyone, i would consider helping (in which case i’d consider your personal finances + likelihood of getting money back)

2020-08-21 at 05:46:31: fuck do i take edibles in the evening to free myself from the expectations i have for myself re: what i will get done by the end of the day

if i *can’t* do the things, then i don’t feel the pressure to *do* the things

(mind you, generally after a fairly productive day)

2020-08-14 at 18:26:12: @nicklovescode oh i like that a lot, reminds me of i think eckhart tolle writing on how intelligence/‘thinking’ is /such/ a small sliver of our consciousness, there is so much more

2020-08-14 at 18:19:49: @nicklovescode ? in the quotes was a typo, please ignore

2020-08-14 at 18:19:21: @nicklovescode what are you then, if it can be distilled into a concise ‘you are your [x]?’ phrase?

2020-08-14 at 18:11:06: big fan of this ‘unofficial roof access’ https://t.co/lPnTKqIycq

2020-08-13 at 05:07:49: @infinitsummer my dude what were u gonna do with em

2020-08-12 at 20:09:36: business idea: culture my own cells and sell them direct to consumer [academic labs, proprietary labs, kids at home]

not so sure about getting a hold of my own neurons though

(mostly a joke)

2020-08-12 at 20:04:35: cc henrietta lacks 😔

2020-08-12 at 20:03:52: if some researcher out there is using a cell line derived from me [during surgery or otherwise], i would like some royalties, thank you

2020-08-12 at 12:25:14: well, at least they're honest? https://t.co/uFp7uX3QFk

2020-08-12 at 11:29:54: cc @_StevenFan - you might find this interesting!

2020-08-12 at 11:28:13: the article: https://t.co/GX1zpNjGyV

the paper: https://t.co/pD1mztEOb4

2020-08-12 at 11:26:56: my q's:

- to what degree does AADC gene delivery have to be targeted in the brain, i.e. must it go to the part of the midbrain parkinson's targets?

- could you perturb blood-brain barrier with microbubbles/hifu and deliver gene systemically, so no neurosurgery required?

2020-08-12 at 11:25:14: i didn't realize we [collective academic science] were doing gene delivery /into/ the brain!

2020-08-12 at 11:18:35: thus: inactive virus used to deliver gene encoding for AADC

previous data suggests gene therapy may yield stable AADC expression for YEARS. more AADC means less levodopa required &amp; that the levodopa provided is more effective. 

in patients, treatment yielded less motor symptoms

2020-08-12 at 11:15:16: in parkinson's, cells producing dopamine die off

symptoms typically managed with drug levodopa, but over time levodopa loses effectiveness

levodopa is converted to dopamine by the enzyme AADC, but as disease progresses, supply of AADC dwindles

2020-08-09 at 03:20:58: @gptbr00ke i felt the exact same way watching clueless a few weeks ago!

2020-08-09 at 02:45:42: knowing &gt; being known

2020-08-09 at 02:35:17: @ItzSuds @jzlegion @krishkhubchand thank u genz kings! i was able to get in contact :)

2020-08-08 at 19:47:36: @krishkhubchand ooh pls engage with me

2020-08-08 at 04:54:27: @goblinodds as far as bfrbs go though, have never been able to shake lip biting

idk if i’ll ever be able to, but part of it is likely that i don’t feel a drive to stop bc it doesn’t affect quality of life

2020-08-08 at 04:52:38: @goblinodds woah this reminds me i used to compulsively pull eyebrows/eyelashes out from ages 11-16 or something like that - grew out of it though, grateful i did

2020-08-07 at 22:41:32: and i’ll love them more for it, because all we want is to know and to be known, and what deeper way to be known than to be reflected?

2020-08-07 at 22:40:51: thinking about the behavioral patterns of mine to which my future children will become attuned to and ultimately, intuitively, learn to exploit to get their way (more playdates, spend more on treats or clothing)

2020-08-07 at 22:23:23: RT @p_millerd: stop trying to think about "impact" at scale and just be nice to one person

2020-08-07 at 20:20:17: boutta do what i do best and turn chaos into order

2020-08-06 at 23:54:57: found out an acquaintance with type 1 diabetes can’t walk up hayes street westward past alamo square park w/o packing carefully selected food so her blood sugar doesn’t bottom out

2020-08-06 at 21:04:06: stop making apps for god’s sake

2020-08-06 at 20:43:54: i wonder if there’s a way to perpetually exist closer to my authentic self

2020-08-06 at 20:43:24: i find when i have to write consequential messages (reaching out to people i admire, updating a prof on progress, asking for a job), i have to wait for my authenticity to bubble up and allow me to articulate my motives in a way that feels honest

2020-08-06 at 20:20:25: i almost have the sense that it knocks you down to rem sleep and keeps you there longer than you would normally - therefore sleep feels more restful

purely intuitive though

2020-08-06 at 20:19:20: hypothesis: small sativa dose before bed can improve sleep quality

2020-08-06 at 01:57:41: @gptbr00ke @visakanv these are friggin incredible

2020-08-06 at 00:31:04: reading about best wet lab experiment planning practices and who are these fuckers who ‘scroll through their pubmed alerts during centrifugation steps to keep up with the literature’

2020-08-06 at 00:26:02: @gptbr00ke @visakanv what other cool stuff have you found?!

2020-08-06 at 00:23:49: huge fan of my mother

2020-08-05 at 23:48:51: @samgraver my reasons

- lifestyle (chronic sleep dep for at least a few years, then hours on end in OR or similar)
- local impact (your patients) versus potential global impact (your research’s broad potential impact)
- premed in the US? no thank you

2020-08-05 at 16:58:47: @qorprate so tempted to reply to original post w link to paul g essay ‘keep your identity small’

2020-08-05 at 16:24:05: @cybersygh 😭 godspeed sotonye, sending you strength to navigate this minefield

2020-08-05 at 16:18:03: @cybersygh i think this works in the pre-relationship trying-to-attract-a-mate phase, but not so when in a committed relationship. weird disconnect

2020-08-05 at 06:38:32: scrolling through twitter, paralyzed, how will i wash my hair and read as much as i want to read and pack my lunch before my target bedtime of 1215am

2020-08-05 at 06:30:57: @musicgossip3000 i'm inclined to agree that narrativizing life is not good 

but i believe is that people, in general, need to be convinced that they have more agency over their lives, and a concise way to say this is 'don't be a side character [npc] in your own life'; 'be the protagonist'

2020-08-05 at 06:29:15: @musicgossip3000 fuck this hits hard i remember being a kid and singing my heart out to 'numb'

2020-08-05 at 00:33:46: framing your life as a narrative: good and bad, what’s your tendency?

2020-08-05 at 00:32:31: at work, emphatic discussion about diabetes being stigmatized

i think more people need to take their diabetes seriously, de-stigmatization as a priority seems silly and even counterproductive

2020-08-04 at 22:54:39: fyi long dresses under lab coats is my aesthetic of choice

2020-08-04 at 22:42:30: fine line between funny, loving admonishment of your friends’ flaws - the kind that makes both of you laugh and signals you know each other well - and criticism that is spoken and sits unbidden and gathers negative energy in the back of the receiver’s head

2020-08-04 at 21:28:12: also check out this vonage ad i saw this morning

says ‘our biggest competitor was founded in 2008. we don’t know about you but we wouldn’t trust our business with a 12 year old.’

not a strong argument lol https://t.co/PMgbhhrfxD

2020-08-04 at 21:26:03: thinking about pioneer program put out by laura deming and others, and how youth of participants was construed as inherently positive

2020-08-04 at 21:25:12: imo youth shouldn’t be given undue value in start up world

but neither should age, unless age is coupled with relevant experience

note that superficially i strongly disagree, but am curious

2020-08-03 at 19:16:36: dropping this here as something i've been wanting to do, similar concept but for molecular genetics
https://t.co/EkQF7Vz9qt

2020-08-03 at 19:13:09: chapter 2 of zero to one has convinced me of the value of digging deeply into history (tracing the genesis of the dot com bubble back to the beginning of the 90s) for necessary context

2020-08-03 at 18:33:52: heart leaped seeing john stuart mill has an essay 'the subjection of women', very excited to see what he has to say

2020-08-03 at 18:32:50: @cIass_man i don't want to believe semester is starting THIS MONTH

2020-08-03 at 16:47:02: e.g. structure of scientific revolutions, zero to one, this gene regulation quasi textbook i found

2020-08-03 at 16:46:04: books that started as a series of lectures &gt;&gt;&gt;

2020-08-03 at 16:43:44: @tdoggyholhol shitty little comet is about where i’m at now haha

2020-08-03 at 16:43:33: @tdoggyholhol big fan of the conceptual construction of this thread - moving from simple but striking definition of serendipity to celestial bodies analogy

2020-08-03 at 16:27:17: @gptbr00ke 💕❤️

2020-08-03 at 16:11:48: @abolishprenups swiss chard is objectively the best green; for pasta i’d say spinach, arugula, or thinly cut collard (latter has texture and health benefits of greens w/o overtly affecting flavor)

2020-08-03 at 16:09:41: after which the rest of the month will be peppered with small, impulsive purchases (e.g. $48.24 at buffalo exchange for a pair of pants and a final sale red floral blouse with a v-neck too low for comfort) to compensate for the material pleasures i denied myself initially

2020-08-03 at 16:06:04: physical pained by my july spending, reflexively resolving to deny myself of material pleasures this month, which will last until 2 weeks in when i crack and spend $8 at starbucks on a medium (not small) chai tea latte with almond milk and a savory pastry because i deserve joy

2020-08-03 at 15:49:03: don’t accept your flaws (physical, mental) as an allowable anchor for who you are

accept them but do not identify with them
do not let helplessness and lack of agency be your attitudinal north star

2020-08-03 at 14:48:06: big fan of taleb’s friend in ch 1 of fooled by randomness, who’s a trader but has the ability to read n work out during work day

2020-08-03 at 14:46:50: i think i could be happy as like... an academic as long as i believe i’m doing enough and don’t feel like i need to be at work 9-5 to compensate for lack of concrete progress

2020-08-03 at 14:43:55: @qorprate ugh maybe i need to believe that my boundaries are valid

2020-08-03 at 14:42:37: @qorprate yeah is tough to set aside work/non work time, the two end up blurring together, net result more stress 😭

+ working in a team means your boundaries subject to change based on when people available/send deliverables

2020-08-03 at 14:39:37: @qorprate my superiors at current job work 7 days a week, no semblance of ‘shut off time’, frequently working from 8am to 10pm hour

i love idea of doggedly working on a passion that pays... but even so need more balance and more time not at work

2020-08-03 at 14:35:39: lol a lofty long term aspiration is to win a macarthur fellowship

2020-08-03 at 14:34:19: the 9-5 kills the polymath

2020-08-03 at 14:33:46: use internal barometer to determine whether enough (quantity and quality) work has been done

2020-08-03 at 14:33:00: ultimately want flexibility of not being bound to 9-5

2020-08-03 at 13:33:05: sleep deprived, achy, dissociating a bit from both the good and bad in my life, resolving to act in a way that upholds my personal standards for behavior better, must clarify those standards, must not take brain too seriously right now

2020-08-03 at 13:31:00: funny how driving noticeably faster than everyone else only shaves off a marginal amt from transit time

2020-08-02 at 22:07:04: @qorprate yes i think incongruence is a mental framing pattern i’ve fallen into; anonymity was liberating at first, no reason it can’t continue to be

thank u for reading and offering your thoughts :)

2020-08-02 at 22:04:56: @qorprate this makes sense. also realizing that there’s inherent asymmetry between realname/anon accts, hence why realnames likely less likely to interact w anons

2020-08-01 at 22:16:43: extremely cathartic 

https://t.co/VtSYZmBIcp

2020-08-01 at 22:13:07: gonna tag some folks whose opinions i'm curious about, mutuals and others too. this is a long thread, so if you have the time to read it through - @class_man @abolishprenups @goblinodds @lehoczkyescobar @qorprate @infinitsummer @mechanicalmonk1 @visakanv @nosilverv

2020-08-01 at 22:08:42: that's where i'm at, guys. would love to hear your thoughts via replies, dms

2020-08-01 at 21:54:47: i don't want to commit to creating an online record of my thoughts (i.e. tweets) that is permanently linked to my realname.

but i want a) more congruence between me irl and me online, b) some degree of credibility not usurped by anonymity (see last few tweets)

2020-08-01 at 21:51:44: similarly, on quasi realname acct, i followed someone i follow from this acct. she followed me back and even dm'd me! that was cool. 

but does that mean she looked at this acct, and thought that the same person - me, under the veil of anonymity - didn't merit the same attention?

2020-08-01 at 21:48:52: with anonymity i lose credibility.
ideally i'd hope that my ~interesting tweets~ would make up for my lack of credentials/interesting institutional association.
but experience with this thinker - who i still admire, he's amazing! - convinced me otherwise

2020-08-01 at 21:46:44: of course i am not entitled to a person's follow!
but i have the sneaking suspicion that if i were to list my realname, affiliations, etc, thinker would have followed me, too. 
ironically i now *live* in the same neighborhood as this thinker but i am reluctant to reach out

2020-08-01 at 21:44:34: silly but i have a chip in my shoulder from -
i tweeted at an sf thinker i love from this acct, praising his podcast with some of my thoughts mixed in with the praise. bf had tweeted something similar months ago, from his realname account. thinker followed bf &amp; not me.

2020-08-01 at 21:41:47: which brings me back to: full anonymity versus the alternative - some association with irl me - assumption being that association with irl me will yield a greater feeling of congruence, less dissonance

2020-08-01 at 21:39:02: my assertions at this point in this long thread - 

(1) i believe in the value and interesting-ness of my mind &amp; spirit
(2) twitter is great (occasionally a cesspool, nevermind that)

so, it is in my interest to figure out how to interact w twitter in a personally workable way

2020-08-01 at 21:35:00: many more examples, but those are the two that spring to mind immediately. beyond that, i have lost track of how many times i talk with @xiexiexiexiex and either begin or further a conversation with, 'this reminds me of a tweet by []...'

2020-08-01 at 21:31:53: ava (noampomsky) is another example of a person living her life in a way i find deeply admirable. guided by intuition and the honest pursuit of fulfillment, a hedonist in the most positive sense. + her observations are just the most interesting things
https://t.co/VCrhvDQKD6

2020-08-01 at 21:27:47: this interaction between nibras and rival voices struck something deep inside me, still gives me chills. nibras's self-love and relentlessness are something twitter has shown me is worth striving towards
https://t.co/NnAhvCg73t

2020-08-01 at 21:25:15: a few self indulgent "these are tweets and people i think about a lot":

2020-08-01 at 21:19:24: forgive me for the image formatting - steinbeck writes that "Nothing was ever created by two men... The preciousness lies in the lonely mind of a man." (full excerpt in image)

knowing this, resonating with this, why am i on twitter? https://t.co/BvBV7Mi1uR

2020-08-01 at 21:13:06: having read 25% of meditations and 21% of east of eden, i am strongly convinced of the value of my mind and spirit, and i don't feel the urgency i used to feel with twitter, to demonstrate to others that i am smart and interesting and working at a cool place, please talk to me!

2020-08-01 at 21:10:41: the first person i 'hung out' with in sf was a girl i met on friggin 'bumble bff'. i was *lonely*! we picnicked in embarcadero. without going into detail, that experience cemented that i'd rather spend time alone than with people who dull my spirit

2020-08-01 at 21:08:59: i love walking around baltimore because every street has a building that evokes a memory. that's where [redacted] left me puking in a stranger's bathroom that fateful december night, that's where i lived three years ago or two summers ago. sf is new and exciting, but impersonal.

2020-08-01 at 21:06:34: i was deeply lonely for my first two weeks in sf. barely saw roommates due to differing schedules, knew no one in city. had work friends, but after work day ended was faced with choice of a) going home to my silent apartment or b) walking around this cold, unfamiliar city

2020-08-01 at 21:04:07: despite quoted tweet, i still keep coming back to twitter. maybe because of dopamine addiction, but i do believe that there is deeper value. in time i've spent off of twitter, i've been reading a lot more and started journaling more regularly.
https://t.co/ZlmqZuvsSH

2020-08-01 at 21:01:50: my less pseudonymous account was made with the goal of interacting with people, but people don't interact with you unless you bring something of value (ideas) to the table

i'm more able to articulate myself in a way that feels authentic on this account

2020-08-01 at 20:58:45: i love twitter because of 1) the interactions i have with my twitter friends, and 2) the first point in the quoted tweet. i can't enjoy twitter as consciousness-expanding when i have unclear boundaries for self-censorship ('did i reveal too much?')
https://t.co/V65IkeonwW

2020-08-01 at 20:55:22: linking my twitter account to irl me by a few threads was another uncertainty inducing endeavor. wanted to do enough to confirm that i was a living, breathing person but wanted to avoid being in a position where acct was linked to, say, company i work for.

2020-08-01 at 20:52:27: in general underlying motives serve to undermine purity and authenticity and fun

2020-08-01 at 20:51:43: in contrast, other account: was anticipating a move across the country to a place where many of my twitter idols reside (san francisco, baby), and i wanted to engage with them and feel more legit doing it. some notion that twitter engagement could lead to irl engagement one day

2020-08-01 at 20:50:16: the genesis of this account occurred in quarantine. i was stuck in my parents' house, lots of excess social energy, wanted to finally try and get the hang of twitter

2020-08-01 at 20:44:34: ironically overall effect of having these two accounts is that i use twitter a whole lot less, perhaps because i'm forced to ask myself - why am i on here anyways? why is it such a big deal if my professional/academic/personal associations are known?

2020-08-01 at 20:42:20: note that i did at one point have an account with full irl name, first and last, and had university affiliation in bio - univ affiliation is long gone, but google retains the association and thus pulls up that account alongside linkedin, etc if you look up my name. not in use lol

2020-08-01 at 20:40:58: so full disclosure regarding my criteria for what constitutes the difference between fully anon/semi-pseudonymous

on latter, screen name is derived from irl name; i have posted a picture of my real face (!)

2020-08-01 at 20:38:18: i really like this series of thoughts. i feel this weird unease when i think of the incongruence between irl me, this account, and less pseudonymous account - and what gets me is that this unease is fully self-created

2020-07-17 at 20:16:25: question: can results from plant transcriptome studies be extrapolated to humans, and, if so, with what qualifications

2020-07-17 at 07:39:35: @michaelcurzi my hypothesis is that this is bc of self-determinism / sense of agency being at odds with the surrender required by faith
but i'm not sure how to work past the doubting-of-prayers... any thoughts?

2020-07-17 at 07:37:46: @michaelcurzi woah okay i was just thinking a few days ago about how i tend to qualify many of my prayers, e.g. i think to myself, this isn't big or significant enough to warrant a prayer, or i don't want this badly enough to pray for it

2020-07-17 at 07:33:39: @lehoczkyescobar @michaelcurzi these are v good :)

2020-07-13 at 17:26:35: gotta develop agency over small things (waking up, going to bed, focusing on work for x min) before moving to larger scale agency (getting a car, financial independence goals)

2020-07-13 at 05:21:18: @BenjiBacker inundation w info from all angles makes the pursuit of knowledge less appealing but the pursuit of truth essential

2020-07-13 at 05:20:31: @BenjiBacker interesting how now we have to consciously choose what information we want to consume and what low-quality stuff we wanna avoid, to preserve mental clarity

2020-06-26 at 00:30:54: doing some thinking about the distinctness of femininity and finding it challenging to mentally separate distinctness from a) implying limitation, and b) implying second-class status

once i overcome thought patterns suggesting a and b.... you just get ready....

2020-06-16 at 07:11:33: @krzhang oh totally, maybe a container that plugs into a temperature controlled microfluidic system

you know, maybe some extensive automation exists in industry but has yet to hit academia

2020-06-16 at 07:04:35: @krzhang a part of me wonders how useful a fully automated system like this would actually be - if it's intended to save people from coming in on sat/sun -

because... i think wet lab people (myself incl) enjoy the lite masochism of coming into work on the weekend

2020-06-16 at 07:02:26: @krzhang wifi would definitely be a step in the right direction but the bulk of the battle (imo) is figuring out how to automate the steps a human would normally do:

open up the 37 deg C incubator
take out certain plates
take out certain media
aspirate out old media
...
put plates back

2020-06-13 at 21:06:32: @VitalikButerin wonder if in time we'll have 'bio bootcamps' where people pay for 6 weeks to learn all the bio skills they need to be successful at up and coming biotech companies, which are by then a dime a dozen...

2020-06-13 at 20:44:58: thinking about how it is in my best interest to work to be as happy and joyful as i can be every single day

2020-06-13 at 19:03:42: @jillian_kern @eayucel @ReadMoreScience like harvard anthro (saw an article about this))

2 questions -
universities tend to be highly left-leaning - why do you say the liberal hive mind doesn't exist?

i see that you're a phd student. out of curiosity, what do you plan to do after completing your degree?

2020-06-13 at 19:03:01: @jillian_kern @eayucel @ReadMoreScience yes you're right about the salient point being that even tenure isn't job safety.

seems like tenure protects the wrong people - profs accused of sexual harassment and assault for one. perpetuates systems of complacence (bret weinstein's case; sexual harassment endemic in depts

2020-06-13 at 02:43:14: like, you load your flasks/plates into the machine before going home

at home, you log in and start the machine
look at your cells under a microscope, decide what the next step is depending on density, and have the machine replace media/replate one plate into 4 plates/etc

2020-06-13 at 02:41:16: wonder how much of cell culture/maintenance could be done remotely - 

not necessarily in a fully automated way, but like connecting to your work computer from home

w stem cells it's practically expected you will come in on weekends to replenish media, passage, etc

2020-06-13 at 02:15:22: to be fair i was pretty swayed by prestige back in the day
and only have some clarity as to what i would have wanted in an undergraduate experience, near the end of mine

don't get me wrong - i am grateful and largely content with my ugrad

2020-06-13 at 02:12:33: rather than chasing after selectivity ('down to single digit acceptance rates!') and hanging on to prestige

2020-06-13 at 02:11:52: for smaller state schools, forging strong industry connections for a few fields of study (engineering for sure but also even poli sci and business) and making that a key part of the brand

2020-06-13 at 02:09:58: given that undergraduates are becoming more and more like customers of the university.... what if colleges consciously attempted to improve their product

e.g. providing a highly idiosyncratic undergrad experience à la caltech

2020-06-13 at 01:54:47: christ do i miss pipetting... my beating cardiac cell cultures.... rna extraction....

2020-06-13 at 01:53:22: seeing at home bio lab set-ups would be super cool given my general interest in democratizing science

2020-06-13 at 01:51:34: wondering if there are any folks with nifty at-home bio labs in my area - seems like it's gonna be some time til normal access to academic type labs will be possible

2020-06-13 at 01:47:38: odd longing for the day when an undergrad in my lab identifies themselves as [my name]'s undergrad

2020-06-13 at 01:44:32: just walked into my apartment from outside and it smells of sweet indian chai - odd since i haven't made any in some time

2020-06-12 at 20:36:25: relevant episode

https://t.co/W9sjcgMPSP

2020-06-12 at 20:31:41: i want to emphasize - disagreement is instantly branded as bigotry

so if you want to be a 'good person', you *cannot* question things like: 'shut down stem' tuesday, 'abolish the police' etc etc

you are given no space to think
you *must* blindly accept https://t.co/S1sXxJbBc8

2020-06-12 at 20:26:26: @eayucel @ReadMoreScience it seems to me that even if a prof has tenure, if they dare to disagree with the [largely liberal] student body

disagreement is instantly branded as bigotry

and even tenure can't save you from students demanding you resign

2020-06-12 at 20:22:56: @eayucel @ReadMoreScience here's his wiki with a whole section on the controversy - https://t.co/OO1FUrfnYu

2020-06-12 at 20:21:51: @eayucel @ReadMoreScience hmm i'm interested to hear what you think of bret weinstein - prof at evergreen state who challenged a day where non-black students, faculty were asked to stay off campus -

unclear if he was tenured, but he spoke out and was ultimately forced to resign due to student backlash

2020-06-12 at 19:49:12: bf and i visited my parents yesterday and phew i've forgotten the feeling of social exhaustion - could feel it building up and then it hit me like a ton of bricks, felt like my patience was really wearing thin for a bit

2020-05-22 at 06:17:06: @_StevenFan i think you'll figure out with time what kind of context to include, to get the kind of engagement/feedback you want. it's great that you've found a way to tap into prolific mode in the first place

2020-05-22 at 06:04:35: @_StevenFan here is a note taking thread i did based on a paper - was fun to synthesize and attempt to present in a concise but precise way

have you read geoffrey west's 'scale'? [i tried but couldn't get into it] 
your vision seems similar but with diff starting point (carbon chem vs scale laws) + ultimate medical slant

2020-05-21 at 00:16:31: before i found words i saw this thought in my mind's eye - mom cradling cat and bf hunched over soldering iron, and in the purest way the two figures merged into one glowing figure

i have a hard time visualizing, so my mind presenting an idea as a vision was a welcome surprise

2020-05-21 at 00:14:20: if u know bf it will come as no surprise that he saw this tweet and went 'oOoh you're amAaazed when i talk about electromagnetics'

2020-05-19 at 02:15:25: takeaway: mastery is mastery regardless of what it concerns. maybe the unifying features are a sense of authority and ability to elicit admiration

2020-05-19 at 02:12:33: i was amazed at how intuitively my mom knew how to handle my cat despite never having pets of her own - the care and authority in her movements

realizing this is, at its core, a demonstration of mastery

just like the amazement i feel when, say, bf talks about electromagnetics

2020-05-19 at 01:48:06: i think i answered my own goddamn question

2020-05-19 at 01:47:49: so what's the move tonight folks?

barefoot pinot grigio, orange juice + shitty vodka, langunitas wonder ipa... or green tea to preserve and run with the mental clarity that arrived unexpectedly this evening

2020-05-19 at 01:17:12: this desire to give back is a new and welcome feeling for me

usually and habitually, i am not the best at mothers' day/fathers' day/birthdays/showing appreciation

2020-05-19 at 01:15:20: (full disclosure i have yet to think through how i feel about organized religion. that'll come with time and experience. generally i'm inclined to think it is a force for good, a force that encourages us to strive and live more intentionally)

2020-05-19 at 01:12:17: as it stands, the center seeks to offer a space for already-religious folks to keep up with their practices and beliefs

this is good
but by facilitating discourse and exposure, and gatekeeping less, an interfaith center could really embody the transformative power of religion

2020-05-19 at 01:09:49: short of creating an entirely new interfaith paradigm and physical space,

if the existing interfaith center had a way for people to systematically experience diff services/practices - now that would be cool

2020-05-19 at 01:08:16: two summers ago i earnestly searched for religion - attending various christian services, reading texts, listening to devotional music, praying and waiting for something to stick

(didn't achieve any sort of clarity until nearly a year later)

2020-05-19 at 01:02:14: but in a space like a classroom, i'd wager few people are strongly/openly religious, so it's not the perfect set up for religious discourses

but then again religion becomes meaningful not in 'religious discourses', but when applied to how we live and experience our lives

2020-05-19 at 01:00:04: as far as what exists right now, the closest thing to an 'interfaith center' as i'm thinking of it could be a classroom - more generally, a space where people are brought together on the basis of something totally separate from religion

and so the space becomes a microcosm

2020-05-19 at 00:57:37: and that probably works well for people who subscribe to any one of those faiths

but a truly 'interfaith' center could be so much more than that

human history indicates that interactions b/w people with differing beliefs lead to insight/discovery... and/or bloody war

2020-05-19 at 00:55:01: in reality i think an 'interfaith center' is a physical building where each faith has its distinct space
the building is not inherently conducive to or designed with the goal of productive interactions between people of diff faiths

it's just a church n a mosque n a synagogue etc

2020-05-19 at 00:52:15: walking by my school's interfaith center -  i've never been inside, even though in theory an 'interfaith' place would be perfect for a person like me 

or more generally anyone seeking religion, looking for an intuitive fit

2020-05-19 at 00:22:10: sure i disagree with some nuances of how she's parented me but on the whole she has sacrificed and strived and gosh i feel this really profound sense of - i need to give back

2020-05-18 at 23:52:49: i listened to the podcast like weeks ago now but this notion of 'right to self' has become a constant background thought that has informed and expanded what i think is possible

still lots of half-baked thoughts, i'll share as i sharpen them just a bit more

2020-05-18 at 23:52:08: somehow problematic ep 1 has awakened this avalanche of clarity and excitement in my head

championing our individual-level 'right to self' is such a powerful way to contextualize scientific experimentation and to work against institutions of all sorts limiting our potentials

2020-05-01 at 18:03:24: @visakanv ooh an image processing concept analogous to operating at multiple resolutions is scale space - progressively blurring image (see attached)

- feb '19 astrazeneca/moderna passed phase 1 test w bare vegf RNA - next step packaging in lipid nanoparticles

2020-04-30 at 03:51:22: notions:
- *what if modRNA paracrine factor delivery as readily available at bedside as statins*
- single cell RNA seq insight to elucidate further promising regen/cell switch factors
- multiplex factor delivery

2020-04-30 at 03:51:22: conclusions:
- purpose of increasing vegf-165 expression is that it's a 'cell-fate switch in determining vascular specification' -&gt; higher vegf-165 induces regenerative state of cardiac cells
- modRNA deliv efficient + no risk of insertional mutagenesis bc no genome integration

2020-04-30 at 03:51:22: deliver vegf-165 via modRNA to 1) evade counterproductive immune activation, 2) increase gene xfer efficiency

modRNA: 'replacement of cytidine with 5-methyl-cytidine and uridine with pseudouridine suppresses RNA recognition by dendritic cells via TLRs 3, 7 and 8'

2020-04-30 at 03:51:21: phase 1/2 clinical trials for intravenous delivery of vegf-165/121 recombinant proteins... but half life too short to be impactful (half life extended w biomaterial delivery platforms)

so... circumvent translation w mRNA

but myocardial gene delivery is not trivial

2020-04-30 at 03:51:21: main idea:
*cell free* approach to delivering factor (vegf-165) that can help w cardiac regen

2020-04-30 at 03:51:21: priors:
- cardiomyocytes don't have much regenerative capacity
- previously, cells transplanted to injured heart bc they secrete 'unknown [but helpful] paracrine factors'
- stem cell deposition into damaged heart problematic bc of heterogeneity -&gt; pro-arrythmic

2020-04-27 at 06:22:14: @seacucumberesqu @Aella_Girl generalizing the specific experiences she had into a pattern/theoretical concept unifies those experiences. maybe imagine if each experience she describes was from a separate woman. the vocab of theory allows for their disparate experiences to be more than the sum of their parts

2020-04-27 at 06:18:02: @seacucumberesqu @Aella_Girl so yes, she was able to describe her experiences w/o theory, but i think theory had a crucial role in helping her recognize the pattern (discomfort associated with unwanted male attention) in her experiences

2020-04-27 at 04:19:23: @seacucumberesqu @Aella_Girl i think transferring this concept - giving name and validation to experiences - to gender is actually quite important. a lot of feminism is recognizing and naming sensations and experiences [chiefly] women have - and which would normally be passed over/not discussed

2020-04-25 at 23:56:59: @gamespotting @cognazor another interpretation could be neither obvious to yourself, and perhaps then definitely not obvious outwardly.

which category does your experience fall in?

2020-04-25 at 23:56:09: @gamespotting @cognazor this criterion also got me, but i'm thinking now about how to define obvious. like i can very clearly say, x events led to y physical manifestation of trauma. but not so many people are aware of y.

so, obvious to me but not to people perceiving me outwardly

2020-04-25 at 23:52:37: @cognazor i wonder how the responses to this correlate w respondant age - i feel like as we age we become aware of our trauma. and then there's the bridge from awareness to acceptance of its impacts.

when did y'all recognize your trauma?

2020-04-24 at 16:41:10: ** esp with account not explicitly linked to identity because it feels like there's less 'transformative potential' for a twitter connection to become irl

irl isn't necessarily end goal but it's a nice feeling knowing you have friends in diff corners of world

2020-04-24 at 16:28:43: have a nagging sense that me twittering is misdirected social energy - i should be reaching out to the people i know irl and investing in those bonds

probably not mutually exclusive!

how does twitter make you feel socially fulfilled?

2020-04-24 at 15:33:15: omg imagine if i added a projector to my work set-up - probably more motivated to write when the blank word doc is taking up an entire wall

2020-04-24 at 03:10:20: and the new visuals for my mind's eye! dormant t cells ~infiltrating~ tumors and not being off much use until they're ~activated~ via checkpoint blockade therapy or what have you

2020-04-24 at 03:08:05: have some sense that describing the cell source of an immunotherapy as autologous [from same patient therapy will be used on]/allogenic [from generalized cell line] can be used in other contexts

2020-04-24 at 03:06:32: didn't really grasp meaning of 'synergistic' til i read about how diff cancer immunotherapies can work together &amp; have a combined effect much greater than either individually, e.g. anti-CD40 and CPG co-delivery

2020-04-24 at 03:03:50: one thing i'm loving about getting deeper into immunology is finding terms i can use to express more complex ideas in other writing. new vocab i can borrow and new analogies to draw

2020-04-24 at 02:56:48: can't stop thinking about vancouver! feeling such a pull to be there

the glass buildings / seamless integration of nature and urban landscapes / layout and neighborhoods and cafes open late / at night could see into people's warm apartments and imagine idyllic lives for them

2020-04-24 at 02:50:35: god to be at uc santa barbara on a clear summer night lookin up at the infinite stars. i've never seen so many stars

2020-04-24 at 02:28:21: @QiaochuYuan wow this is some lovely insight

video/audio calls have been polarizing in my long distance relationship bc i prefer vid, he prefers audio. i tend to conflate audio w 'he doesn't want to see me' but ironically often audio calls are the best. makes much more sense now..

2020-04-23 at 00:35:55: @PoemsAndPlay @marti_nah222 @ryanbrooks hahaha i appreciate the humility. 

you're right with the idea of networked spaces making triggering content way more accessible. trauma is probably too strong a word for the unhealthy media consumption patterns a lot of us are getting stuck in, but definitely akin to trauma.

was wondering - do you have any thoughts on how the upcoming phd application cycle will be affected by covid-19? seeing lots of hiring freezes and pay cuts and wondering what that means for applicants. insecure funding, fewer spots?

2020-04-22 at 07:20:50: @PoemsAndPlay @marti_nah222 @ryanbrooks hey! would you mind elaborating on the concept of trauma being on delivery? i think that's a super interesting notion n would love to hear more of your thoughts

2020-04-20 at 22:43:42: RT @CecilYongo: Normalize saying “I don’t know enough to have an opinion.”

2020-04-20 at 21:36:19: @nosilverv hell yeah love this

2020-04-20 at 21:35:46: RT @nosilverv: My ultimate most core feeling is something like "despite all of their fucking. bullshit.,      I just love humans"

2020-04-20 at 21:11:36: @avwinter @agaudeul @eatcarrots7 @VanBradf0rd @TJLaFave @Liv_Lanes yes :))

if no one speaks up, jokes like this will continue to be made without a second thought. i'm hoping to make people think just a lil harder, and be just a bit more empathetic :)

2020-04-20 at 21:06:17: @DeFips @TJLaFave @Liv_Lanes haha what did you take from it?

2020-04-20 at 21:04:49: @96fps @TJLaFave @Liv_Lanes however i've found that generally, for men, women's issues aren't 'relevant' until you frame them as their girlfriend/wife/daughter etc etc

i take issue with that as women are independent entities
however wanted to facilitate op's understanding hence my framing

2020-04-20 at 21:00:17: @96fps @TJLaFave @Liv_Lanes yes good observation :)) 

i resonated immediately w how girl would feel - clearly brilliant, capable woman doing cool work, i assume happy in her relationship, makes a joke about her bf and now bc she has framed herself in romantic context, a man thinks fair game to hit on her

2020-04-20 at 18:18:01: @litgenstein glad this appeared on my timeline though, the absence of fundamental laws in bio drives me crazy. lookin fwd to perusing some of the literature you've linked

2020-04-20 at 18:16:14: @litgenstein imo bio kinda has to be teleological in the absence of fundamental laws. hard contextualize and motivate 'we found that x protein is a competitive inhibitor of y receptor' w/o a sense of how that interaction is part of a broader pathway or response

2020-04-20 at 18:09:57: @emuehlbe great that existing offers are being honored - seen a bunch of offers being rescinded at other places

2020-04-20 at 15:47:08: @VanBradf0rd @TJLaFave @Liv_Lanes yes, i understand your interpretation. i wanted to foster greater empathy by expressing mine. even if you do not see from my lens, do you understand why the original comment could be perceived as an advance?

2020-04-20 at 13:12:53: @TJLaFave @Liv_Lanes hey man, you should know that this comment comes off as an unwanted advance. she's making a lighthearted joke and clearly has no issue with her boyfriend. how would you feel if your partner posted something on twitter and some guy made the comment you did? not cool
