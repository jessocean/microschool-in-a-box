I think my issue is mainly a lack of familiarity with the whole landscape of color management, so unfortunately I don't have much useful feedback about this specific implementation

2023-05-25 at 18:16:36: I'm trying to use color proofing but cannot for the life of me get anything remotely vibrant into CMYK space

2023-05-25 at 17:45:05: Pray for me, I am installing a development version of GIMP that supports CMYK conversion

2023-05-25 at 17:35:56: So far I've
- used a CMYK color picker to find a color that works
- converted it to an RGB color value
- changed background color of RGB image
- converted it to CMYK image

but the color goes off in some random direction!

2023-05-25 at 17:35:55: It's white text on a lavender background.

First img is the color I want; first attempts lead to a muddy mauve, second attempts to a violet blue https://t.co/VwRyhmlkDh

2023-05-11 at 19:55:59: @lisatomic5 @goblinodds @love_of_reason So your high-EQ doctor friend would interpret emotions in an intuitive but draining way

And probably someone like Scott Alexander has trained to interpret emotions in an analytical and (presumably) not draining way

(based on https://t.co/cFEAXAOvuA )

2023-05-11 at 19:54:05: @lisatomic5 @goblinodds @love_of_reason Yeah, there are other things to consider, like maybe... is the emotional interpretation intuitive+instant or analytical+deliberate, and how draining is it?

Then you'd have
- intuitive / not draining
- intuitive / draining
- analytical / not draining
- analytical / draining

2023-05-11 at 19:39:59: @lisatomic5 @goblinodds @love_of_reason Mhm! I was sketching out a bit of a graph here... 

salience of others' emotions vs. ability to interpret others' emotions

Is HSP just high salience, or also high ability to interpret / high EQ? https://t.co/wlWWMp6kHx

2023-05-11 at 19:24:32: @goblinodds @lisatomic5 @love_of_reason If someone in that situation ALSO has autism-spectrum difficulties in interpreting social &amp; emotional cues -- that's a pretty intensely difficult situation

2023-05-11 at 19:22:53: @goblinodds @lisatomic5 And adding what @love_of_reason said - hyperattuning to other people seems like a different axis

One aspect is common in developmental trauma - "I need to be hyperaware of others' emotions to stay safe"

https://t.co/zxdmYMqw2W

2023-05-11 at 19:21:34: @goblinodds @lisatomic5 Can also be: "It's too intense and I get overwhelmed / melt down -- and maybe eventually I get numb or dissociate &amp; don't even get the msg"
^ issues w/filtering &amp; maybe hyposensitivity, more like autism and/or trauma stuff

2023-05-11 at 19:21:17: @goblinodds @lisatomic5 From a starting place of high sensitivity, there can be:
"It's intense &amp; I like it"
"It's too intense, but I get the message &amp; change my environment"
^ for both of these, there could be some commonalities w/HSP &amp; autism

2023-05-11 at 19:20:54: @goblinodds @lisatomic5 Yeah, I think there are multiple axes here... one around sensory intensity, one around attuning to others' emotions, and maybe another about how the person relates &amp; adapts to the sensitivity

2023-05-11 at 18:56:29: @FractalAuth I'd be totally fine with an analog temp control - just as long as they're separate, so you can set the temp &amp; forget it, and then just turn the water on and off!

(might be what's keeping it "stuck")

2023-03-10 at 14:52:15: @mechanical_monk When I use visual imagination to render an apple, I can make a wireframe, fill it in with color, cut it up, or w/ more effort play with light &amp; surface texture

but at the same time I'm aware that it's black behind my eyes.

Can also do it eyes open, doesn't make much difference

2023-03-10 at 14:47:30: @mechanical_monk &amp; I think visual imagination is more likely to be disrupted or dispelled by shifting your attention, like a daydream 

while hallucinatory visual perception (patterns etc) can definitely be affected by attention but not as easily "blinked away" (depending on dose &amp; substance)

2023-03-10 at 14:44:41: @mechanical_monk Visual imagination can elaborate on material in visual perception, eg playing off swirls of color or geometric patterns "seen" behind closed eyes

I think vis. img. is the same "space" where dreams happen

2023-03-10 at 14:39:30: @mechanical_monk Hmmm, I think that's approximately accurate for me. I explored the eyes-closed difference between visual perception &amp; visual imagination a lot while working at an ayahuasca center in Peru, bc psychedelics can affect both

2023-03-10 at 05:17:53: @hormeze Here's some stuff on schemas from the Coherence Therapy manual

I wonder how Core Transformation would handle a "functionless symptom" -- a symptom that's a side effect of a purposeful pattern

"And what does that get you"... might not have a clear answer https://t.co/DFPiyUbsrH

2023-03-10 at 05:14:40: @hormeze There's overlap for sure! 
"reversing the chain of intended outcomes" is a juxtaposition of "thing you used to do + reason for doing it" with "already having the core state in an embodied ongoing way"

There's something about layers of schema constructs though...

2023-03-08 at 22:09:45: @zencephalon @georgejrjrjr @romeostevens In the same way, you probably don't need to need to reify any emotional/mental subsystem unless it's actively involved in some internal conflict and needs a temporary handle in order to get untangled

2023-03-08 at 22:09:20: @zencephalon @georgejrjrjr @romeostevens When I talk about it, I might say: 

You don't usually notice your elbow as a separate part unless you've sprained something - unless it's been in unsustainable tension with another part of your body. 

When it's working fine, it's working smoothly in the background.

2023-03-08 at 22:06:17: @zencephalon @georgejrjrjr @romeostevens I like the ecosystem framing! I'd also rather use a metaphor that is less likely to give folks the heebie-jeebies...

2023-03-08 at 19:26:07: @quotidiania @AnneSelke Present-moment-spacious intimacy
- Wow! Amazing! 
- Being with the resonance w/o assuming it'll continue or that it means a particular thing
- Noticing what might be possible re: updating self-concepts, schemas, etc -- that *someone* gets me in this way means it's possible...

2023-03-08 at 19:22:46: @quotidiania @AnneSelke Present-moment-fixated
- I JUST MET YOU AND THIS IS CRAZY but we are DEFINITELY soulmate twin flames forever now
- unfounded extrapolation of resonance
- can become a pattern if someone is super good at opening up but lacks capacity for relational repair or differentiation üò¨

2023-03-08 at 19:21:58: @quotidiania @AnneSelke Relational-history-spacious intimacy
- Reliable, familiar, safe, easeful
- You know how the communication works
- Trust that you can recover from misinterpretations
- You can count on them

2023-03-08 at 19:21:45: @quotidiania @AnneSelke Relational-history-fixated intimacy
- ALL UP IN THEIR BUSINESS
- Fusion / lack of differentiation
- Blurring of self-other boundaries in a trapped / friction way
- Their behavior reflects badly on me as their [parent, wife, etc]

2023-03-08 at 19:14:49: @quotidiania @AnneSelke What about... "relational-history-intimacy" vs "present-moment-intimacy"?

And then both types of intimacies can be either fixated-collapsed, or expansive-spacious 

OHHH it's time for a 2x2!! ü§©

2023-03-08 at 19:12:18: @quotidiania @AnneSelke In the second kind, there might be very little "who we are to each other" beyond this moment, which can be "airy" / "ungrounded" -- or can also bring a lightness and spaciousness

2023-03-08 at 19:12:14: @quotidiania @AnneSelke One distinction I'm tracking: with the first kind, there's something to fall back on, in terms of the depth &amp; richness of experience in the relationship with this person... though that can also bring heaviness or complexity

2023-03-08 at 19:10:53: @quotidiania @AnneSelke Maybe something like... "deliberate" / "practiced" intimacy vs "spontaneous"?

Though, hmm - that doesn't quite capture that people can do a lot of deliberate practice in stuff like eg circling!

2023-03-01 at 19:30:53: @dispirateparts @algekalipso I think it'd be possible to test the 'felt safety' vs 'vigilance' thing re: hallucinations - if the person needs something changed in the environment, or does some grounding exercises, such that it feels okay to put on eyeshades - are closed-eye visuals present &amp; vivid?

2023-03-01 at 19:29:11: @dispirateparts I... don't know if it's physiologically possible for psychological factors to affect the appearance of tracers (depending on dose &amp; substance) - @algekalipso might know!

2023-03-01 at 19:28:07: @dispirateparts Oh, another thing - if someone doesn't feel safe in a particular setting on psychedelics, they may be more vigilant and perhaps more likely to unconsciously clamp down on mild open-eye visual hallucinations - patterning, walls 'breathing' etc

2023-03-01 at 19:25:27: @dispirateparts come to think of it -- ffffffff that's prob what happened to me, and I miss it!

working at the ayahuasca center, seems that I trained myself to tamp down on like the "wheeeee hehe!" parts of tripping bc I had to stay alert &amp; oriented to the needs of participants

2023-03-01 at 19:23:52: @dispirateparts Two... yeah I imagine that if someone is going into psychedelic sessions over &amp; over w/ intent to focus on emotions, body sensations, etc... it'd make sense that'd maybe 'train' their system that eg geometric hallucinations are less 'relevant'

2023-03-01 at 19:23:16: @dispirateparts Hmm, I think a few things potentially going on here... 

One, as someone gestured at in other thread, trauma-related dissociation can inhibit all kinds of responses to psychedelics (inc visual)

2023-02-26 at 00:42:18: @Malcolm_Ocean The folks who developed NVC figured that people generally argue the most about the story level, especially "how I am as a person." 

And they tried to make a protocol to help navigate to solutions, w/o needing to take on the extra, sometimes unworkable, weight of meanings

2023-02-26 at 00:41:55: @Malcolm_Ocean NVC says, let's find common ground on what they saw, how they feel about it, and what they're needing. 

Generally not so much to argue with about that - though of course, you may not be able to help w/ that particular need!

2023-02-26 at 00:38:25: @Malcolm_Ocean I like how you phrased it: "neutralize the worldview" / "figure out a solution w/o story"

NVC leaves out the story as way to focus on the strategic level - what is this person's motivation for saying a thing right now?

2023-02-26 at 00:37:42: @Malcolm_Ocean And there are a lot of valuable therapy modalities that specifically follow those charged stories or frames, work w/ them as emotional schemas. 

NVC was made for situations where there's not a container for that kind of therapeutic work.

2023-02-26 at 00:37:28: @Malcolm_Ocean Yeah, it's like... say worldviews (or stories, or frames) are a mechanism for bringing two things together really fast. Like a mousetrap! 

Observation--&gt;interpretation--&gt;snap!

"You did [or didn't] do the thing!" can get fused with eg "You're a bad person!"

2023-02-18 at 19:42:42: Our convo moved on, but something kept bugging me... 

Wikipedia has something interesting:

https://t.co/BaHuKD5Ot3 https://t.co/pwCPPNw9ki

2023-02-18 at 19:42:41: Me: But if you took those same characters &amp; scrambled them up into gibberish, it'd be hard to specify in any shorter way

Him: Sure. But for a specific gibberish string, the order matters! Order doesn't matter in a sushi smoothie.

2023-02-18 at 19:42:41: We'd agreed that a pattern of like, the entire alphabet repeated 1000x would be low entropy, low surprise, easy to specify with a short program. 

(the "short program" thing is the Kolmogorov complexity, turns out)

https://t.co/IQCNgEhV6Y

2023-02-18 at 19:42:40: (btw here's some background info on entropy in thermodynamics &amp; information theory)

https://t.co/cIaWAJK1WT

2023-02-18 at 19:42:40: I was thinking thermodynamic entropy, so I said blending the sushi would increase entropy

He'd initially said it be less -- I was confused, and then we realized he might be thinking about information (Shannon) entropy

I'm still trying to figure something out...

2023-02-18 at 19:42:40: Just realizing that I think I got Kolmogorov complexity mixed up with Shannon entropy...

during a sushi date conversation where we were trying to figure out if a sushi smoothie, besides being probably terrible, would have more or less entropy than tasty orderly sushi

2023-02-17 at 15:56:18: @captain_mrs @reasonisfun @blisstweeting @metaLulie It's interesting - that was also a cue / indicator at one meditation retreat I did. I *hated* the first time they tested it (it clearly triggered something), but later had some surprising experiences of not-dissociated not-flinching at interruption

2023-02-17 at 05:38:03: Yes! I want this! I didn't realize Christopher Alexander had written about this

And just letting the system update w/o pushing

2023-02-17 at 03:00:44: @m_ashcroft @QiaochuYuan @meditationstuff Yeah! Coherence Therapy (UtEB) is specifically about this. The stance is all about getting experientially in touch with the stuck prior ("emotional schema") - the way in which that pattern of thought / feeling / behavior makes deep sense to some part of you

2023-02-13 at 02:51:40: @FluidityAudio Someone might come to an integration circle and be like, "Uhhh so I saw God last weekend? Or like, I was God, but also the cosmos? Which was awesome, um, but now it feels kinda weird to worry about exams... but I also have midterms coming up?"

2023-02-13 at 02:50:14: @FluidityAudio Re 1, 2, &amp; 3 that you described... it's not just about working with adverse life experiences in the context of a psychedelic session, or talking about how that went

2023-02-13 at 02:46:59: @FluidityAudio For many events of this style, there's a norm around not offering unsolicited advice (it can feel like prematurely jumping to fixing), but someone might also ask the group for pragmatic suggestions

2023-02-13 at 02:44:24: @FluidityAudio People might want different things, or get different things, from that

For example:
- feeling heard / witnessed
- 'you're not alone in that'
- 'here's how I made sense of a similar thing'
- 'oh man, that sounds really hard. what are you needing right now?'

2023-02-13 at 02:41:45: @FluidityAudio This particular event is different from a meetup / discussion group bc we're not so much talking about topics (eg "What is microdosing?")

It's people describing experiences they've had (difficult, wonderful, weird, whatever!) and... getting some help making meaning of it?

2023-02-13 at 02:37:20: @FluidityAudio You're welcome to join if you're wanting help making sense of a past psychedelic journey, or if you're looking to make the most of preparing for a future session."

2023-02-13 at 02:36:29: @FluidityAudio The blurb for our events: 

"These circles are about weaving your psychedelic experiences back into your daily life and into the fabric of community, through sharing and reflection.

2023-02-11 at 00:30:57: @ruespieler, the process of prompting Midjourney for the image reminded me of how you've talked about "creating an avatar" when stepping into space-holding roles - it felt very clear which images were closer or further away, and this one really clicked!

2023-02-09 at 22:44:35: ...but I still think it would tend to intensify more slowly, or the person would tend to sit down, or that sort of intensity would be induced by eg sitting or lying down and closing eyes.

2023-02-09 at 22:44:35: That sort of very immersive very rapid onset / rapid decrease visual field alteration *while walking* also seems unusual for mushrooms. 

People can certainly walk around in very altered states...

2023-02-09 at 22:44:34: - OR be catalyzed by the addition of an extra short-acting substance (like inhaling nitrous oxide)

- Or perhaps it would make sense in a festival setting where the music is building to a climax

- Or perhaps if some really significant realization just "clicked" for the person

2023-02-09 at 22:44:34: I'd expect that such intense visuals would either:

- come on with a more gradual intensification and taper off more slowly as well,

- OR be catalyzed by a shift in setting (like lying down and closing eyes),

2023-02-07 at 05:59:47: Any thoughts, @_awbery_, @JaredJanes, @anielsen108, @JakeOrthwein...?

2023-02-07 at 05:58:10: Or is that an okay approximation of "trek-chod in the context of finding the presence of awareness in the experience of emotions as physical sensations" but there's also a lot of other applications / contexts for trek-chod?

2023-02-07 at 05:58:09: Is there more to trek-chod than "experience emotions as physical sensations in the body, with enough spaciousness to be present w/ it &amp; not freak out"?

2023-02-07 at 05:57:03: Here's a tweet that's prompting my question (see up &amp; down thread from there):

https://t.co/gQmcQZHaIv

2023-02-07 at 05:56:17: Anybody have thoughts on how the Buddhist practice of trek-chod relates to practices like Pendulation from Somatic Experiencing?

 Here's Pendulation:
https://t.co/APK00is8Ci

2023-02-07 at 05:52:23: @Lavendhole @degenerateyogi Their other caveat: 

"This week‚Äôs meditation technique is a simplified approximation to one from the Tibetan tradition, called tr√®k-chod."

So there's probably more to it, in other applications!

2023-02-07 at 05:51:43: @Lavendhole @degenerateyogi Their caveats:
"useful only when you have emotions strong enough to feel in the body as physical sensations. However, attempting it can also uncover buried feelings. For that reason, please avoid this method if seriously depressed, or suffering from other mental dysfunction"

2023-02-07 at 05:50:05: @Lavendhole @degenerateyogi It's basically what's already been said: get some capacity for being with stuff that arises in a spacious way (remaining present, not freaking out). Then notice the emotional texture of a thought, notice any accompanying physical sensations.

2023-02-07 at 05:48:59: @Lavendhole @degenerateyogi And here's the Aro meditation course, free via weekly email...

2023-02-07 at 05:37:24: @Lavendhole @degenerateyogi I do actually think that some of the non-Buddhist practices, like Pendulation from Somatic Experiencing, are covering some pretty similar ground in relation to "feeling emotions as physical sensations in the body and being okay with that":

https://t.co/APK00is8Ci

2023-02-07 at 05:36:26: @Lavendhole @degenerateyogi So you could start with the EG resources on opening awareness: https://t.co/4W23XUtexp

2023-02-07 at 05:36:15: @Lavendhole @degenerateyogi I don't actually know exactly how trek-chod relates to the Four Naljors meditation progression, but I think that being able to find spaciousness in relation to the physical sensations of the emotion is an important foundation

2023-02-07 at 05:30:57: @Lavendhole @degenerateyogi Ah, I think it's mostly talked about on the Discord, and probably also in different calls: https://t.co/SNOFo3M0Yn

Trek-chod is also apparently described in Week 11 of the Aro email course, and in the book Spectrum of Ecstasy, lemme see...

https://t.co/F3vFGdLO2s

2023-02-06 at 23:40:44: Last but not least, there are two phrases that have resonated with me around this topic of "what to do with feelings," which have come to mind in psychedelic or meditative states:

cure every last bit of attention

&amp;

find the place from which the dissonance is not a problem

2023-02-06 at 23:40:43: This last category is basically whatever helps you be with and get through the emotion with less damaging fallout -- if you run around the block or count to 10 or journal, anything!

2023-02-06 at 23:40:43: I'd add - most of my public notebook in Roam is full of these other approaches! Especially the pages on parts work, internal conflict, and grounding techniques.

2023-02-06 at 23:40:43: "and a preference for transformation (so that there are no damaging side effects) over suppression (actively preventing damaging side-effects) of emotion if available. You use the capabilities you have available, and perhaps add new capabilities over time..."

2023-02-06 at 23:40:42: 4) Any other available approach

Ari wrote:
"breathing, self-control, affirmations, psychotherapeutic techniques, physical techniques, energetic techniques, etc. with a preference for energetic techniques over physical techniques¬†if available"

2023-02-06 at 23:40:40: 3) Root approaches that find a place from which the emotion is not a problem (often - but not necessarily - leading to the energy moving through or dissolving)

2023-02-06 at 23:40:40: If so, a different approach is probably a better fit (after which the "emotion-as-signal-to-action" might get resolved on a meta level, or the corresponding action might become more clear on an object level).

2023-02-06 at 23:40:39: But maybe it's not that! Maybe it's something else! 

There are infinite possible actions, and sometimes the correspondence between feeling and indicated action isn't that clear.

2023-02-06 at 23:40:39: For example, when I'm getting antsy or nebulously grumpy at the computer, I might check - how does my back feel in this chair? Maybe I need to adjust my posture, get up &amp; stretch, walk around, redesign all chairs, etc.

2023-02-06 at 23:40:38: 2) Take appropriate action (sometimes very subtly)

Treat the emotion as useful information / feedback for your actions. For example: when hungry, eat; when tired, sleep.

2023-02-06 at 23:40:38: I'll add: 

For example, when my friend's cat died, I felt sad. It felt appropriate and congruent that I felt sad; I didn't particularly want to feel less sad (or more sad), and when I gradually felt less sad, that felt complete too. 

(Such a good floof cloud who sat funny! ü•≤) https://t.co/CjVMwPIh3z

2023-02-06 at 23:40:37: I'll expand on each of these... 

1) No response needed

Ari wrote: "The emotion is implicitly recognized as congruent. Nothing to do. No intuition of incongruence arises. Life goes on."

2023-02-06 at 23:40:37: When an emotion comes up, 4 main ways you can respond: 

1) No response needed

2) Take appropriate action

3) Root approaches that find a place from which the emotion is not a problem (often leading to the energy moving through or dissolving)

4) Any other available approach

2023-02-06 at 23:40:36: For once, I didn't draft the thread in Twitter!

https://t.co/JPIscQNRHF

2023-02-06 at 23:40:34: I've seen a couple of tweets this week about "what to do about feelings," so I decided to paraphrase something that @anielsen wrote a while back in a meditation group, &amp; rewrite it for a more general audience. 

(Welcoming any comments or corrections, Ari!)

2023-02-06 at 22:31:02: If that matches what you're wanting, I hope to see you at the February GCI workshops!

https://t.co/XEVWHKtNqY

2023-02-06 at 22:31:02: Top-down: realizing that you want to do different things, based on what you care about

Bottom-up: realizing that you care about different things, based on what you're actually doing!

Either way, you bring your intentions &amp; actions into better alignment - less internal conflict!

2023-02-06 at 22:31:02: And a little more about those ruts, "shoulds," and procrastination:

If you're feeling blah in those ways, it's probably a good time for an intention realignment! 

That might come through in 2 different ways...

2023-02-06 at 22:31:01: Also, good to check, if you:

- Are decently comfortable switching between a couple of different tabs or windows, and engaging with coaches in a text chat

If that sounds like too much fuss on your screen, I'd recommend in-person coaching, or perhaps 1-on-1 video calls

2023-02-06 at 22:31:01: Another good indicator, if you:

- Have enough slack in your life to attend a 5hr online workshop

(If you're in a crisis mode, w/ overwhelming stress &amp; time scarcity, I'd recommend starting w/ a 1-on-1 convo w/ a friend or a coach, to find the next little step of breathing room)

2023-02-06 at 22:31:00: Who tends to get the most out of the GCI workshops? It's an especially good bet if you're:

- Finding yourself in ruts, "shoulds," procrastination
- Facing some upcoming decisions
- Needing to make a lot of your own structure, in work or personal life

Plus a couple more...

2023-02-06 at 22:31:00: We've got a couple more Goal-Crafting Intensive online workshops coming up, on Feb 18 &amp; 19!

2023-02-04 at 23:48:43: Even the ~20s aftereffect mimics the "huh text is a little hard to read" effect of light psychedelic experiences

2023-02-04 at 23:47:38: Fascinating video!
"Motion after-effect optical illusion" totally fails to capture how cool it is that you can stare at a pattern for 1 min, then look around the room &amp; experience ~20s of *extremely psychedelic visual field warping* - then back to normal!

2023-02-03 at 19:28:12: @dispirateparts @m_ashcroft Do you have a sense of what kind of scope or focus you're wanting, for this? 

As in, what kinds of moves are you wanting to help people make? Or how would someone be able to tell if they were a good fit for the kind of coaching you're offering?

2023-02-03 at 19:26:02: @dispirateparts @m_ashcroft That's how a lot of therapy / coaching skill training programs work! 

I'm taking an IFS course right now, and we have practice calls where we take turns in the therapist / client / observer roles. Sometimes also w/ feedback &amp; light suggestions from an observing facilitator

2023-02-03 at 18:58:05: @xerambela @the_wilderless Also, root beer currently can't legally contain safrole, because when you feed lab rats too much they get liver cancer. Seems not to hold up as a human risk in more recent studies though:

https://t.co/DhqpARSosm

2023-02-03 at 18:55:48: @xerambela @the_wilderless Right, from what I've heard sassafras doesn't produce enough % safrole to be economic currently (though it's a fast-growing tree)

For a while there was a lot of overharvesting of Cinnamomum trees in SE Asia for safrole for MDMA, but I think another synthesis became more popular

2023-02-03 at 18:41:36: @seconds_0 @OneEyedAlpaca Hell yeah, this was a great idea!

2022-12-30 at 06:41:17: @hormeze [Part of me wants to talk about ELECTROPLATING but not to a hypothetical 5yo when it's almost 2am]

2022-12-30 at 06:39:53: @hormeze One carbon atom plus 4 hydrogen atoms makes methane, which is in FARTS!

It's not what makes farts stink, though - that's hydrogen sulfide, which is one sulfur atom plus two hydrogen atoms: https://t.co/0p7VBSld44

2022-12-30 at 06:34:18: @hormeze It doesn't have to be just two atoms, either! 

For example, carbon has 4 electrons (or stuffed animals) and wants 8. 

Hydrogen has 1 and (it's complicated) is happy with 2. 

One carbon atom can share pillows with FOUR hydrogen atoms, and then they're all happy! https://t.co/iHwjvNibYk

2022-12-30 at 06:30:41: @hormeze [Science aside: ionic bonds are grabby, covalent bonds are sharing, polar covalent bonds are like... sharing but one is kinda hogging it]

2022-12-30 at 06:27:44: @hormeze There's a lot more you could learn about from here! 

We looked at a pretty extreme version of grabbiness, with 1 pillow vs 7 pillows. But if the atoms have a less different number of pillows, they'll sometimes be happy with sharing instead of grabbing.

2022-12-30 at 06:23:02: @hormeze But a negative chloride ion could also stick to something like a positive potassium ion - a different element! 

That would make potassium chloride instead of sodium chloride. You can still eat it, and it tastes salty with a little more 'bite'. Some grocery stores sell it! https://t.co/rXGztnOYkq

2022-12-30 at 06:21:03: @hormeze In a reaction like that chemistry video, the closest thing to the positive sodium ion is the negative chloride ion 

[its name changes a little, but it's still chlorine plus an electron]

So they'll stick together - kinda like opposite ends of magnets! - and form table salt!

2022-12-30 at 06:19:08: @hormeze Now, one more thing -- when chlorine grabs an electron from sodium, they're cozy like neon in one way (surrounded by 8 stuffed animals), but they're a little out of balance in another way (their + or - charge)

This means they'll be attracted to things with the opposite charge!

2022-12-30 at 06:15:25: @hormeze This is because Benjamin Franklin was confused, a long time ago. 

We could have just as easily named it the other way around, but people got used to it, and now we're stuck with it!

https://t.co/mui0ukAE4l

2022-12-30 at 06:14:40: @hormeze Usually we say "positive" when a number is going up, &amp; "negative" when it's going ‚¨áÔ∏è

But if we're talking about electrons &amp; charges, it's backwards! 

As the number of electrons goes up, the charge gets "more negative" &amp; when you lose an electron, the charge gets "more positive"

2022-12-30 at 06:10:50: @hormeze Now, you asked what it means for something to be positively or negatively charged -- and we're getting there! We've just taken a few detours along the way to collect the ideas we need. 

Just ONE more detour where I have to explain a kinda dumb language thing...

2022-12-30 at 06:10:28: @hormeze And when sodium loses an electron, it's also cozy! It's surrounded by 8 electrons that were in an underlying ring. 

But it also has one less electron than the number of protons it has. So we call it an "ion" and say that it has a positive charge, a charge of +1.

2022-12-30 at 06:09:58: @hormeze Ok, so when chlorine grabs an electron from sodium, it's happy! It's surrounded by 8 electrons /"stuffed animals" and it's cozy. 

But it also has one more electron than the number of protons it has. So we call it an "ion" and say that it has a negative charge, a charge of -1.

2022-12-30 at 06:00:03: @hormeze Here's what that looks like in real life, not in a diagram, when each atom of chlorine grabs an electron from an atom of sodium: 

https://t.co/gg6RZRorR1

2022-12-30 at 05:59:15: @hormeze Ok, so when grabby chlorine with its 7 outer electrons and overstuffed sodium with its one extra outer electron meet up, what happens??

If the conditions are right, chlorine will grab one of sodium's electrons! https://t.co/XQSrpLchKj

2022-12-30 at 05:42:18: @hormeze [Science aside: that ring structure (Lewis diagram) is only one way to think about where sodium's electrons are. 

Here's another way, which is better for figuring out some things &amp; arguably more accurate, but not as easy for figuring out other things]

https://t.co/5zdA6v5PuY

2022-12-30 at 05:33:29: @hormeze [Science aside: The "grabbiness" is called electronegativity, and here's how it increases across the periodic table - there are several contributing factors that are cool to learn about]

https://t.co/vFDslAh4xr https://t.co/gLdE5NKBWh

2022-12-30 at 05:28:40: @hormeze And here's one way to think about chlorine and its electrons / stuffed animals:

It has a nice happy ring of 8, but then there's an outer ring of SEVEN and that's just not ENOUGH!!

Chlorine is feeling very grabby! https://t.co/otdEXAiqpA

2022-12-30 at 05:26:14: @hormeze Now let's look at sodium and chlorine, the elements we talked about earlier that make salt when they're together. 

Here's one way to think about sodium and its electrons / stuffed animals: 

It has a nice happy ring of 8, but then there's one EXTRA and that's ANNOYING

UGH https://t.co/W7HxHlyP6Y

2022-12-30 at 05:21:14: @hormeze So neon doesn't want to bond with anybody. It's happy as can be, totally satisfied, taking a nap!

2022-12-30 at 05:20:54: @hormeze Neon has 10 protons in the middle and 10 electrons, with 8 of those electrons on the very outside. 

It's totally neutrally charged - same number of protons &amp; electrons, so they cancel out. 

And it has the "happy number" of electrons outside, like the kids with 8 stuffed animals

2022-12-30 at 05:20:02: @hormeze Ok! Let's start with the noble gases. These are gases like neon, which we use to make light-up signs: https://t.co/fX77qyJhBX

2022-12-30 at 05:07:57: @hormeze Ok, so just how like the ends of magnets with the opposite charge pull towards each other, the protons in the middle of the atom and the electrons on the the outside pull towards each other

(they can't get all the way close for complicated reasons)

2022-12-30 at 05:05:49: @hormeze [When you're older, you can watch this video of a very clever man, Richard Feynman, who talks about how odd and loopy it is to try and explain this!]

https://t.co/5nM3k2hK6f

2022-12-30 at 05:05:03: @hormeze When we play with some bar magnets [here, have some bar magnets], you can notice that the ends w/ the same charge push away from each other, and the ones w/ the opposite charge pull towards each other

The "why" is too complicated for right now, but just remember the feel of it.

2022-12-30 at 05:03:58: @hormeze The little kids are like the "nucleus" of the atoms. In an atom, the nucleus is made up of "neutrons" and "protons". 

So, you asked what it means for something to be positively or negatively charged...

2022-12-30 at 04:51:35: @hormeze So how this relates back to elements and atoms, is that it turns out atoms are made of smaller parts. 

The parts on the outside of the atom are called "electrons" -- in our story, these are like the stuffed animals surrounding the little kids.

2022-12-30 at 04:50:12: @hormeze Now, these kids don't have a rule against grabbing toys, but they DO have a rule against throwing toys on the floor. 

So if you want to get rid of one, somebody else has to take it

2022-12-30 at 04:49:44: @hormeze If one or two stuffed animals are missing, the kid is so grouchy! There's a gap, they feel cold and a little lonely!

If a kid has one or two extra, they're so antsy! They're too hot and crowded!

2022-12-30 at 04:49:08: @hormeze [science note: I am only talking about the octet rule for main group elements on either side of the periodic table. The first 2 elements and the stuff in the middle of the periodic table all have a different "happy number" than 8]

https://t.co/740W4VkKkS

2022-12-30 at 04:48:57: @hormeze But why do they pair up? And why do some elements connect up and others don't?

Well, this is a little silly, but imagine some little kids, and the only way they will happily take a nap is if each kid is surrounded by EXACTLY eight stuffed animals

2022-12-30 at 04:33:09: @hormeze So, table salt for example - it's made of sodium and chlorine. 

On its own, sodium is a soft silvery metal that explodes in water. And chlorine is a toxic yellow-greenish gas that smells like bleach. 

But when they pair up, they form regular salt!

2022-12-30 at 04:30:02: @hormeze [Here I'd refer to Steven Universe fusions if we'd watched that show, though 5 is prob too young] https://t.co/DEW3IAnrox

2022-12-30 at 04:28:41: @hormeze Some things are made up of one kind of atom, like a pipe that's all iron. 

Other things are made up of two or three or many kinds of atoms. 

When atoms connect, we call that a "molecule." The thing atoms make together is different than how they are when they're apart!

2022-12-30 at 04:26:05: @hormeze So, everything that we can touch is made out of these building blocks that we call elements. There are over 100 different kinds!

The smallest bit you can have of an element is called an atom.

2022-12-30 at 04:19:51: @hormeze If I was actually going to explain it to a 5yo... well, first I would ask, what did you hear or see that made you think to ask? 

[to see what I can connect it to, that they're interested in &amp; familiar with]

I might start with this song:

2022-12-29 at 02:21:50: When I sign in, the flights still exist in the app &amp; website...

Only callback options are for next week, after my flight

Is this going to involve *another* 4hr hold?

2022-12-29 at 02:19:51: aaaa

10am, email from WestJet: "We're sorry to advise you that it has been necessary to cancel [your flights]."

Noon, email from WestJet w/my original itinerary, as if nothing is wrong: "We look forward to welcoming you on board!"

2022-12-27 at 13:11:33: @abhayance @kcorazo @acesounderglass Optimizing/exploring: enough functional abundance that there's slack to revisit "what you deeply want" - are there new areas you haven't been exploring? are there tweaks &amp; refinements to the flows of existing joyful meaningful activities?

2022-12-27 at 13:08:47: @abhayance @kcorazo @acesounderglass I think the Slack Inventory etc stuff is most useful in 2 phases / situations: triage, and optimizing / exploring 

Triage: System feels busted. Urgent problems. Running on empty in various ways

[Some middle ground where things are working well enough to mostly go with gut]

2022-12-27 at 12:36:24: @acesounderglass @VectorOfBasis Cool format!

I wonder... would it be useful to have a list of conversions?

Like, I can convert 20 min into, say, +2 (of 10) units of "physical and emotional rest" if I remember to listen to a Non-Sleep Deep Rest recording.

You could then refer to list of low on one (or extra)

2022-12-27 at 12:28:32: @kcorazo @abhayance @acesounderglass I'm not sure if I cite this in Slack Inventory, but the CFAR section on "Units of Exchange" is also very relevant!

2022-12-21 at 01:13:54: For everyone traveling to hometowns this holiday season, including myself - may we all have a very merry Ram Dass quote: 

"If you think you're enlightened, spend a week with your family."

2022-12-21 at 00:29:41: @relic_radiation @m_ashcroft Oh, something I forgot to add earlier -- whatever self-accompaniment is, or parenting / re-parenting onself, I think that "overwhelmed" is what happens if you lack access to it in that moment

2022-12-21 at 00:27:25: @relic_radiation @m_ashcroft This is probably also only one component of re-parenting oneself! 

Lots of other potential ways to map that landscape, probably lots of routes in terms of what comes before which other components

2022-12-21 at 00:25:16: @relic_radiation I think it's very related to grounding exercises and to what @m_ashcroft might call expanding awareness, what the Evolving Ground folks might call opening awareness

2022-12-21 at 00:24:45: @relic_radiation It's creating capacity to be with and metabolize emotional experiences. "Feeling overwhelmed" is feeling disconnected from that grounded spaciousness. 

Sarah Peyton would call this the "resonating self-witness"; IFS would call it "Self energy"

2022-12-21 at 00:22:28: @relic_radiation I think there's one aspect of this that comes from accumulated-life-experience-wisdom, which might indeed require an older mentor

But there's another kind of self-accompaniment that's very in-the-moment. It's more about presence than specific advice...

2022-12-21 at 00:16:49: @PhaentGames @FractalAuth "May we all find the right balance with precarious relationships"

It's more absurd but also unfortunately more realistic, as EA folks probably *would* find it more efficient to make a distributed market for purchasing shrimp-bliss

2022-12-09 at 21:41:41: @FossilLocator Fwiw, I like some of the basic EA moves ("let's fix neglected tropical diseases!") but I don't follow their logic out very far bc it tends to drive people into existential anxiety when the calculations inevitably get muddy

2022-12-09 at 21:41:30: @FossilLocator It's basically karma points, but with more math and less metaphysics. 

Like, how to think about making tradeoffs of various resources like time &amp; money, vs quantified reductions in suffering or increases in wellbeing.

2022-12-09 at 21:32:24: @FossilLocator This tweet is... probably an obscure joke, but part of the joke is that it sounds plausible for someone deep in the Effective Altruism movement. The Bay Area has a concentration of EA folks, w/ ties to the rationality community &amp; sites like LessWrong.

Does the event manage to have an "upward spiral" quality of fun / growing / learning / healing / building capacity &amp; connection? 

Or is it awkward, "can't find touch anywhere else"

2022-11-09 at 00:54:32: @relic_radiation Mainly because "well-facilitated" is doing a lot of work in the hypothetical... could you say more about how this person hosts the events, and what that's been like for you? Esp in comparison to a less well-facilitated event

2022-11-09 at 00:46:01: @RomeoStevens76 As I'm eating it, I keep thinking: "Oho! A marshmallow?? ...Oh. Huh."

The lumps are a sort of... non-salty mozzarella texture

2022-11-09 at 00:40:12: @RomeoStevens76 Hmm! After 90 min, it's browned on top, but hasn't really "set" - it mostly flops over instead of cutting cleanly

Flavor: Fine, a little "healthy" / bland

If I make it again, the main thing I'll change: blend the cottage cheese beforehand, bc the lumps are definitely noticeable https://t.co/a1wJRLG1VB

2022-11-08 at 22:58:34: @RomeoStevens76 Fair enough! I use the protein powder about daily &amp; the pudding mix often enough that I'm not too worried for myself, but I'll see 

Did add the maple syrup to the top

2022-11-08 at 22:56:48: @RomeoStevens76 Ok! Alterations from original recipe:

- I only had chocolate protein powder &amp; chocolate pudding mix

- I used Simply Delish keto pudding mix instead of jello, which has starch &amp; erythritol instead of gelatin &amp; sugar

I put it in a casserole dish &amp; into the oven! Now we wait... https://t.co/UdiPZi4yIy

2022-11-08 at 22:22:15: I'm going to start by mixing the wet ingredients together, mixing the dry ingredients together, mixing the dry into the wet

Hmm, one question -- is it just half a package of the pudding mix powder? Or do I actually make the pudding @RomeoStevens76 ?

2022-11-08 at 20:59:41: @Mikeachim Some groups might add guayusa to an ayahuasca brew, and the resulting mixture would certainly be psychedelic, but not directly due to the guayusa: https://t.co/1lWXBJu8Ey

If you can find that reference, I'd love to read it!

2022-11-08 at 20:25:24: @Mikeachim They were importing guayusa to Italy? Fascinating! 

But (having drunk a lot of it) there's nothing in there that would cause waking hallucinations. It contains caffeine, plus some of the compounds found in green tea &amp; chocolate. People sometimes report having more vivid dreams.

2022-11-08 at 20:14:46: @uberstuber @impartialpim @nickcammarata @m_ashcroft Yeah, my non-expert take is that what got disproven was "aether is independently-existing *stuff*" 

and the modern pervasive EM field isn't made out of *stuff* -- it's weirder than that

(not sure what to call it -- it's made out of interaction? math?)

2022-09-27 at 19:59:36: @Thinkwert @Nominus9 I feel like there's something missing here... to me, it depends a lot on the context

Eg, a party / hippie / burner event might have a lot more baseline openness, more spaces for social touch where people could lean into flirtatious touch - or lean away, if not feeling it

2022-09-27 at 18:36:42: @Thinkwert @captain_mrs Re touch -- and what's their base rate of spontaneous social touch?

It doesn't say the name of the event, but that's how I avoid missing important calls/events AND give myself time to switch tasks

2022-09-09 at 01:18:44: I love how groups of biologists often get called by the name of their research animal!

At field stations, it'd be like, "Ooh, the snail people were up so late!!" "Where'd all the bird people go?" 
(or shrimp crew, snake folks, etc)

2022-09-07 at 20:41:46: @pragueyerrr excellent choice! glamorous, yet reinforced

2022-09-07 at 19:27:31: @the_wilderless And you'd certainly want surgeons, etc to be able to do some kind of skillful detachment, as part of their job!

https://t.co/HgYHQrKZGm

2022-09-07 at 19:27:00: @the_wilderless Now, I do think all kinds of complex systems of numbness &amp; overstimulation are possible. 

Sadism, masochism presumably involve getting jazzed up from pain resonance as opposed to feeling it as a "nope" signal

2022-09-07 at 19:26:39: @the_wilderless From there, the line of thinking goes: you'd have to numb yourself to that internal sensation first, in order to go intentionally hurt another person

2022-09-07 at 19:26:12: @the_wilderless Far as I understand it: to her, "embodiment" includes an inseparable aspect of resonance

Call it affective or somatic empathy, mirror neurons, etc - seeing someone wince, hearing them cry, feeling them tense up - it echoes in the body sensations / limbic system of the receiver

2022-09-07 at 19:02:59: @the_wilderless If I was going to steelman the idea from the IFS book, it'd be:

We're more likely to harm others (or ourselves) if we're not tuned in to the signals that would tell us when to slow down, readjust, or stop. 

A surgical robot w/ a malfunctioning pressure sensor is a horrorshow

2022-09-07 at 18:55:21: @the_wilderless When I've been in acute or chronic states of stress, overwhelm, flustered -- I become clumsy &amp; ungainly.

I bruise my hips on tables, whack my shins, run into stuff

I figure that when I've contracted my awareness, I'm not as tuned in to my proprioception or environment

2022-09-07 at 18:52:43: @the_wilderless While I think there's no getting away from conflict &amp; use of force -- someone in another thread said, "Are martial artists disembodied?" -- there's also something important in here about feedback, sensing &amp; taking in signals from your environment, &amp; I don't want that to be missed

2022-09-07 at 05:12:02: And finally, an honorable mention that made me laugh:

1. "iridescent ferrofluid turing pattern maze, line art, gradient, logo, vector"

2. as #1, -"maze" +"spiral labyrinth"

First attempt:

2022-09-04 at 05:51:00: @lemonaut1 Can you zoom in on a specific moment when you thought, 'Man, I'm lonely üòî'

Rewind the tape. What was happening right before that? What did you notice, feel, think?

2022-09-04 at 05:50:50: @lemonaut1 Maybe something like, to get more specificity &amp; clarity:

Think about a recent social situation where the vibes seemed great but you felt lonely. Really put yourself in the scene, remembering where you were standing, how it looked / sounded / felt etc.

2022-09-04 at 05:49:54: @lemonaut1 I mean... for some folks, a starting point could involve pragmatic stuff about how to find &amp; make opportunities to interact with people who are interested in deep / quirky / creative connection.

But it looks like you're already in the thick of it!

2022-09-02 at 03:07:23: @cognazor @RizomaSchool @nickredmark It feels like you've expressed, on a content level: 'You're talking shit, Richard'

Check the weight limit on the package, I've used stuff like the 2nd image, and I'm sure the fancier things with toggles etc also work https://t.co/IqKX9ODb6T

Can you say more about the "Flip" - does that involve going right from dissociation to spaciousness? How does that work?

Main thing I can think of is friends' descriptions of ketamine-assisted therapy

2022-07-24 at 07:06:06: Re: working out a fear through sexual energy - the book Existential Kink might come in handy 

Sexual arousal is a dance of parasympathetic &amp; sympathetic nervous system activation - had trouble finding a good article, but this describes at least part:

https://t.co/WG8ihiRJCo

2022-07-24 at 07:06:05: For eating as a route of grounding, I can see how it could help signal to your system that the scene is safe

&amp; I figure digestion would be better after working through some of that high activation (run, exercise), and then doing some grounding (breaths, etc)

2022-07-24 at 06:59:32: Phrases like "rest-and-digest" &amp; "feed and breed" are often associated with the parasympathetic system

https://t.co/c6wBeoQrSh

2022-07-24 at 06:59:32: So going back to VV's 5 Fs, we've got

Fight, flight, feed, freeze, fuck

3 of them are sympathetic nervous system responses to threat (fight, flight, freeze)

2 are basic survival drives (feed, fuck) - and interestingly, they're also usually more associated w/ parasympathetic

2022-07-24 at 06:59:32: Some trauma therapists also include "Fawn" somewhere in there - a "please and appease" response to social threat

https://t.co/z7TanBYYmJ

2022-07-24 at 06:59:31: Then there are various "Five Fs" associated with responses to danger and threat

One version:
- Friend (reaching out for help)
- Fight
- Flight
- Freeze (state of high-tension immobility)
- Flop (collapse, parasympathetic dorsal vagal activation)

https://t.co/DDytMMu6PZ

2022-07-24 at 06:59:31: Then there are a varying number of Fs associated with sympathetic nervous system activation: fight, flight, freeze (sometimes also faint)

https://t.co/nCgYnweCRP

2022-07-24 at 06:59:30: Now let's go back &amp; look at the Fs!

Recall VV describes "Five Fs": 
Fight, flight, feed, freeze, fuck

There's 4 Fs from evo psych, basic instincts that an organism has to survive: fight, flight, feed, fuck

https://t.co/3i9qkduL6B

2022-07-24 at 06:59:30: I really like this "Pendulation" exercise - it helps me hold and gently work with my activation, in a bigger awareness of the grounded spaces of my body. Helps me hold that intensity with myself, even if there's nobody else close at hand

https://t.co/APK00iJbEi

2022-07-24 at 06:59:30: This might correspond with how VV's using "freeze" as one of the 5 Fs

He describes sitting in zazen, being w/ whatever tension &amp; anxiety is there - and that it's uncomfortable!

While at some point, you do just gotta be with it - I'd reach for something like "Pendulation" first

2022-07-24 at 06:59:29: or "blowing through a straw": inhale as if you are breathing in through the straw. On the exhale, purse your lips and breathe out long and slowly.

or ocean breath / ujjayi breath from yoga

2022-07-24 at 06:59:29: Some options for 2), bringing the energy down:

- breathe slowly &amp; deeply, with the outbreath longer than the inbreath (eg. inhale for 7, exhale for 11)

- box breathing

https://t.co/wtXjxNYcLA

2022-07-24 at 06:59:29: This corresponds with at least 2 of VV's 5 Fs - fight &amp; flight

Working out, using a punching bag, going for a run

2022-07-24 at 06:59:28: For 1), make deliberate movements - see what movements or sounds might want to happen - shake / stomp / jump - go for a run - go to the gym or do some other exercise, if that's familiar

Personally, when I'm upset, I like to tear up weeds in the garden!

2022-07-24 at 06:59:28: Now, for someone who's in an agitated state (fight-or-flight), but not collapsed, there can be two main routes: 

1) keep the high energy and work with it to shift the meaning / context, bringing more of a sense of agency and control / not-trapped

or

2) bring the energy down

2022-07-24 at 06:59:27: Also useful is the 5-4-3-2-1 exercise: 

Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, 1 thing you can taste

2022-07-24 at 06:59:27: In practice, that might look like inviting someone to just start making micro-movements, wiggle a toe in their shoe, even move their tongue where no one can see

Gradually build up, get them moving, get them back into awareness of the scene around them.

2022-07-24 at 06:59:26: Now, this shows that the route OUT of (parasympathetic) collapse goes back THROUGH (sympathetic) active responses on the way to social engagement!

But crucially, it's activation combined with safety and control https://t.co/mgycejYgfl

2022-07-24 at 06:59:25: At first, you get active responses to threat - frustration, fight / flight

If that doesn't work, and someone feels helpless/ trapped - then you get more of a high-tension freeze

If the threat persists, there can be hopelessness, collapse, shutdown https://t.co/PXTlCps67C

2022-07-24 at 06:59:23: The black paths show how someone's state can change over time

Ideally you'd like to be the wiggly line, be in ventral vagal for social engagement and then dip into sympathetic activation for excitement, sports, etc

The other line shows what happens under threat https://t.co/29kZ2GsIOQ

2022-07-24 at 06:59:21: This chart has a lot of info! 

A little confusing to map it to the previous one, but also very useful

Middle green box (ventral vagal) = lowest green part

Upper red box (sympathetic) = middle red part

Lower R orange box (dorsal vagal) is up top

Lower L orange box not shown https://t.co/SSXxQNrLEI

2022-07-24 at 06:59:19: I prefer this chart &amp; the next one, from the perspective of polyvagal theory

Here, all 3 of the lower boxes are part of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS):

- Ventral vagal: social engagement, feels good!

- Dorsal vagal: if unsafe, collapse; if safe, deep rest https://t.co/KpXeN46h37

2022-07-24 at 06:59:19: This chart shows a basic 'window of tolerance' model - it's simple, but a little misleading

It's handy to know that "sympathetic" is fight-or-flight (also high energy play, excitement, sports)

Parasympathetic has several different states, which we'll see in the next chart... https://t.co/0AWYLxIbkY

2022-07-24 at 06:59:18: I'm gonna draw from something I wrote about the Window of Tolerance

It's a model in therapy about keeping your nervous system in a state that's good for talking about stuff, not too high or low energy

2022-07-24 at 06:59:17: I'm finding myself with two threads of thoughts: 

One is about sympathetic vs parasympathetic activation, and routes into and out of triggered states

The other is about how those 5 Fs compare to other sets of 4 or 5 Fs from various branches of psychology

2022-07-24 at 06:59:17: VV describes the "Five Fs": 
Fight, flight, feed, freeze, fuck

He says these are ways of activating the parasympathetic nervous system, ways of becoming calm after exposing oneself to a trigger

2022-07-24 at 06:59:16: As I'm listening to this, I'm trying to line up what VV is saying with the maps and models I'm familiar with

Not sure if the differences are more like surface-level word choice, or if there's some deeper differences in approach

2022-07-24 at 05:33:50: https://t.co/w8FyWfccf9

2022-07-24 at 05:33:50: I want to do a bit of a deeper dive into the section on exposure therapy - Tasshin pulled out two excerpts:

https://t.co/epQu7GEFlL

2022-07-24 at 05:30:09: ~35-45 min - "Ideal Apology" practice, imagining in detail receiving a sincere, thorough apology from someone who hurt you

In a similar genre to "Ideal Parent Figure" meditative visualizations

Eventually created space to also acknowledge own role in the dynamic

I think that iridescent hoop tape would be a great way to create some adornments in that style... https://t.co/atHx1BSTVM

2022-07-24 at 05:16:57: @RomeoStevens76 oooh this looks like a great idea

It's different from a yoga strap, right? Those are ~1.5" wide instead of 2", and not stretchy... would a yoga strap help in this position?

I can so picture this! The volunteer Rangers - conflict mediators &amp; problem-solvers - are a wonderful part of what makes burns work. Sounds like the type of healer character you'd find in a D&amp;D campaign!

2022-07-19 at 04:31:58: @nickredmark @DiamonDie So titration is part of pendulation

Pendulation is expansion &amp; contraction, bringing awareness back &amp; forth between areas of groundedness in the body &amp; the edge of an area of activation

Titration is about approaching that activation *slowly* and just going in a little bit

2022-07-19 at 04:28:59: @nickredmark @DiamonDie In working with nervous system activation - or imagery, feelings, memories that stir up discomfort - titration is the process of slowing down to work with just the smallest noticeable bit, just the edge of the tension, and  giving your system time to metabolize it

2022-07-19 at 04:26:39: @nickredmark @DiamonDie Titration comes from a concept in chemistry, where one chemical is slowly added to another, drop by drop. The chemist is measuring and waiting for a reaction to happen at some tipping point, where the solution might suddenly change color, or form a precipitate https://t.co/Rd4RTwphiM

2022-07-19 at 04:21:00: @nickredmark @DiamonDie Mmm... I think I've drawn the outlines of those two concepts slightly differently, in my own understanding. 

To me, they feel distinct, and definitely complementary

Titration is more about the pacing of engaging with actvation, "slowing and portioning":

2022-07-13 at 17:55:57: @liminal_warmth YOOOO do you have a freezer above the fridge

if so, it's probably that ice has blocked up the freezer drain, and when the freezer defrosts itself, it overflows &amp; drips down into the fridge

The fix is to hang heavy-gauge copper wire from freezer heater down the drain tube

2022-07-13 at 06:05:00: @meaning_enjoyer I sure don't have a topknot either, at the moment

2022-07-07 at 03:53:29: @loopholekid Are you familiar with neural annealing, as a metaphor / framework? 

And what about the whole "kundalini awakening" thing? I don't typically use that framework for understanding it, but there are a LOT of reports of people moving &amp; unbinding energy REAL fast in that way

2022-07-07 at 03:51:56: @loopholekid Well - working at the aya center in Peru, we had to do some delicate frame translation

The shaman might say "tienes malos esp√≠ritus adentro" (you've got bad spirits in you) -- we'd sometimes translate as "knotted" or "heavy" energy, if we didn't want to freak the person out

2022-07-07 at 03:45:03: @loopholekid ha! just remembered that's how it works in the "Kill Six Billion Demons" comic - the devils are chaotic and mindless until they're bound with a mask -- a face!

2022-07-05 at 05:55:27: @nickredmark When I hear "chaperone" I think of someone who prevents specific actions -- this sounds more like "wingperson"?

2022-07-04 at 17:40:34: @MAPSCanada Good to hear it turned out well for him! 

And at the same time, I'm surprised the article passed right over the ethical implications of slipping someone psychedelics without their knowledge.

2022-06-26 at 05:43:38: @TylerAlterman @AnneSelke I love the colors and the fabric!! And the way the two panels cross over

I think it could be a better... shape? It's making your torso look apple-shaped, in kind of an odd way. 

What if it came in a little at the waist and flared out a bit lower, at your hips?

2022-06-26 at 05:25:20: @MasterTimBlais @rhymeswithvocal That was about 7 years ago. Didn't fix all instances of the thing!!! Still a lot of mopping up to do. But it did make a fundamental shift possible

2022-06-26 at 05:23:44: @MasterTimBlais @rhymeswithvocal 2. (forgiving-all-past-Sarahs even if there's nothing to forgive)

3. realizing that those 2 patterns combined would result in present-Sarah being accepted by all-future-Sarahs

(for me, this involved the help of a combo of psychedelicsü§∑- it was a weird shape to install!!)

2022-06-26 at 05:22:57: @MasterTimBlais @rhymeswithvocal I ended up doing a simultaneous 3 part thing: 

1. (recognizing that everyone is always doing their best to act in accordance with their needs &amp; values given the limited resources they have at any given time)(committing to that)(recognizing that I can't do other than that)
...

2022-06-26 at 05:20:21: @MasterTimBlais @rhymeswithvocal source: I did this

for me, the first big shift in that pattern involved learning a bunch of NVC conceptually, and then actually *GETTING* the implications 

I realized that even as I judged past-Sarahs, I feared the judgment of future-Sarahs...

2022-06-26 at 05:00:44: @jonnym1ller And on a more interpretive level... maybe something about how, a grief that big can only come from a love that big?

2022-06-26 at 05:00:38: @jonnym1ller When some constriction releases, the emotion-sensation moves through - and you find that you don't actually die or break - it's a relief! expansiveness! return of aliveness-connection!

2022-06-26 at 05:00:30: @jonnym1ller Because the meaning is threatening, the sensations become threatening

Regions of somatic &amp; emotional experience become taboo, cut off - there's a loss of aliveness

2022-06-26 at 05:00:20: @jonnym1ller There's probably an assumption (deep emotional learning about how the world / self / etc works) that allowing the feeling to move through would break you in some way

(Bruce Tift talks about "annihilatory panic" in Already Free)

2022-06-26 at 05:00:06: @jonnym1ller Some scattered thoughts:

I think it's the constriction itself that "feels bad" 

AND - the constriction (big &amp; small dissociations, chronic holding patterns of muscle tensions, all the defensive reactions) is also "trying" to care for something important

2022-06-10 at 01:41:20: @hormeze If you're at a university that does independent or group study, that could be one route (New College of Florida would do it!)

Yeah, google 
college credit for independent study

You'd probably need a faculty sponsor?

2022-06-09 at 22:54:03: @meansinfinity I bet there was some term in Human Synergetics -@Malcolm_Ocean do you recall?

2022-06-09 at 09:36:47: @MasterTimBlais So appreciate you sharing this, in such detail! üôè

I made a, uh, real big thread in response:

https://t.co/jBKTvg1snk

2022-06-09 at 09:25:30: Ok! That's the end of this very long thread, for now. 

(btw, I drafted this with "it" pronouns - I realized partway through that you referred to the part as "him", but I was sleepy and didn't edit it)

2022-06-09 at 09:25:29: One way I'm seeing this whole thing: https://t.co/YYEcr8Punl

2022-06-09 at 09:25:29: Since then, I don't think I've run into that same intense, escalating internal blocking, or at least not for long

I've gotten more able to notice when I'm blended with an anxious, impatient part that wants to fix it already &amp; then work w/ that part until I can get back centered

2022-06-09 at 09:24:29: Here's an example of some of my own parts work, "trust-dancing" with a part that I initially called the "Obfuscator"

https://t.co/gd7umGq0jd

Through this negotiation and dialogue, I eventually found that a better description for it was "Steadfast Intermediary"

2022-06-09 at 09:24:29: Malcolm calls this "Internal Trust Dancing" - I've linked to 3 of his blog posts, here: 

https://t.co/okFl3mr06Y

2022-06-09 at 09:24:29: It will only shift once you credibly understand where it's coming from, and it trusts‚Äîreliably, on terms that it accepts‚Äîthat you will care for the thing exactly as much as it does, but with fuller access to your whole sensemaking &amp; therefore better strategies

2022-06-09 at 09:24:28: Also, let's zoom in on this part's role as a PROTECTOR

It's extremely loyal to -- presumably! -- some part of you, likely some tender / vulnerable part that got hurt at a young age. 

It's PROTECTING that part! It's not gonna give in. It's not gonna compromise.

2022-06-09 at 09:24:28: Whatever the wording, it needs to reflect the potential outcome that feels even WORSE than not having love

and then there's other stuff upstream of that (ie, why it's been so necessary to overthrow all your plans &amp; self-preservations for just a hint of a thing)

2022-06-09 at 09:23:15: So what I'm hearing, from this part's perspective:

[prev tweet, plus]

The only way to prevent [throwing myself under the bus? total self-obliteration?], is to seize up with anxiety pains at the faintest hint of love - even at the terrible cost of going through life without love https://t.co/lMNhFxRFgy

2022-06-09 at 09:23:14: THAT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT!!!

Let's camp out right there! That's what's holding its strategies in place!

2022-06-09 at 09:07:30: Let's revisit what it's caring for - its story and purpose:

https://t.co/PjofTlGRUd

2022-06-09 at 09:07:30: Reading these dialogues, I am SO on Team Tendril Protector, and I would like to help it find some MUCH better strategies to care for its stuff! https://t.co/jnFRQ5YA74

2022-06-09 at 09:01:57: Also, you're jumping wayyy too fast to dissolution!! 

Integration is a lag measure, happens naturally after everything else is sorted out (on its own terms). It's NOT the thing to push on!

2022-06-09 at 09:01:57: As an aside, if you need to explain love to REASON, I found "A General Theory of Love" to be really useful

helped me become a better mammal (still in progress)

https://t.co/Y5AWhPooNs

2022-06-09 at 09:01:56: You're pushing way too hard on love-in-the-abstract, or love-as-overwhelming-force

sometimes it needs a different core state! sometimes it needs a different precondition --- maybe listening, understanding, strength, power to take care of yourself!

https://t.co/T2wwZ4P3Ul

2022-06-09 at 09:01:56: (that power is IMPORTANT! when you untangle this conflict, you'll have access to that strength in an integrated way!)

2022-06-09 at 09:01:55: There's already an assumption in there -- "hey, if I carpetbomb you with love, you'll do whatever I want, right? You're clearly so desperate for it that you'll lose yourself in it, yeah?"

and this part is saying, "That's gonna be a big "nope" from me, pardner" https://t.co/VZOHiBSgWJ

2022-06-09 at 09:01:53: Anyway, the saturation with love thing. It's kind of like that sometimes, but it does NOT work through forcing!

2022-06-09 at 08:55:56: Similar thing happened to me when Malcolm tried to teach me how to do some seemingly-basic trampoline trick - he didn't realize he needed to tell me to tuck my chin, because his body does it instinctively. 

I whacked my head and got awful whiplash!

2022-06-09 at 08:55:56: Nick's thing seems to work well for Nick. And -- he's probably starting from a different context, or instinctively doing some moves that he doesn't even know that he needs to articulate, to get you to do the same thing

2022-06-09 at 08:55:56: Also, like... let's take a minute and revisit your assumptions about the "saturate it with love" thing

First of all, if you're working with this kind of part, you probably need to talk with someone who's been way more of a suspicious bastard than Nick is https://t.co/C1y2Uzx1yL

2022-06-09 at 08:55:54: You can tell by the way you react - when it's resistant, you go into: "fucking Threat you're getting on my nerves"

https://t.co/gOAYGkV57s

2022-06-09 at 08:55:53: Here's a related scene from that Somatic IFS Therapy book: https://t.co/EhL1xm4AUc

2022-06-09 at 08:49:50: This part is right! You're not feeling love for it at that moment:

https://t.co/HZfCefYtkC

2022-06-09 at 08:47:56: - You feel not-okay-until-it's-fixed, &amp; you're (energetically) fidgeting &amp; tapping your foot &amp; looking at your watch &amp; interrupting it and saying, 

"Yeah, yeah‚Äîso: love, dissolution. Can we wrap this up? It's doom if we don't sort this out, and I'm on a tight deadline here"

2022-06-09 at 08:47:55: When you're blended with a fixing part like this, other parts are absolutely going to resist you -- for good reason! 

- You're not actually negotiating in good faith! 

- You don't have space to really hear what the protector part is caring for!

2022-06-09 at 08:47:55: In an IFS therapy session, the therapist would be tracking this, and ideally lending their embodied sense of compassionate grounded presence to the scene, to help you find your center &amp; go from there

2022-06-09 at 08:47:55: (Somatic Internal Family Systems Therapy is somewhat better at describing moves - we're reading it in a book club!)

https://t.co/ysjM4SmXnf

2022-06-09 at 08:47:54: My friend, you were blended with some other exasperated fix-it part! 

A classic blunder! I've done it, everybody does it. 

Most of the Internal Family Systems instructions that point to the actually functional thing (being in "Self" energy) are terribly underspecified

2022-06-09 at 08:47:54: And, here's where you started off on the wrong foot:

You assumed that you already knew what this part needed, and that it needed to be saturated with love and dissolve 

(and thereby get out of your way so you could get on with your life)

2022-06-09 at 08:47:54: - Noticing, even briefly, the part's story and purpose

https://t.co/PjofTlGRUd

2022-06-09 at 08:44:22: - Flexibility - noticing and naming that moment where the label shifts from "THREAT" to "PROTECTION"

https://t.co/gdjcSdoiOU

2022-06-09 at 08:44:22: First off, some excellent moves that stood out to me:

- Doing this at all! That's a huge step! 

- Dialoguing w/ parts, working w/ words, images, felt responses

- Journaling - idk if you were writing this down in the moment or later, but it's very clear! Great way to keep track https://t.co/oNTKRhI4aR

2022-06-09 at 04:02:07: @sashachapin It's such an impressive escalatory clusterfuck of ritual and meaning - I knew what was going to happen, because a friend told me, and still I found myself wincing and wanting to cover my eyes as it got more and more portentous
