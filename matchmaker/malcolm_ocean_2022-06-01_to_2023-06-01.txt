2023-05-31 at 19:25:03: from a bandwidth-optimization perspective it might be possible to make a new image format that can save a ton of space because it's compressed using common pattern/shape primitives

more work to unpack but might be faster

2023-05-31 at 16:53:16: come work with me in this Complice coworking room!

last day to do that, in a sense

(and that's good news, for reasons that'll become clear if you come see what I'm working on)

2023-05-31 at 07:03:50: randomly found myself reading about Macau, 21km¬≤ on the coast of China that was owned by Portugal from the 1500s until 1999 and functioned as a trading post among many other things

2023-05-30 at 19:36:58: something I like doing, as part of keeping my thinking clear, is making sure not to say "apparently" when I mean "allegedly"

ie when
it did not appear to me itself
but rather
some source said it was so

2023-05-29 at 22:59:42: Gricean maxims for conversations

importantly, these are descriptive, not normative/advice

2023-05-29 at 22:54:48: @kalinh I guess you could say I am winning the war

2023-05-29 at 21:09:52: anyway, the proof is in the pudding &amp; so far I've neither helped more people nor made more money, so don't take this thread as having much credibility

we'll see if this reframe/re-aim helps me over the coming months &amp; years. it feels right.

how do you think about it?

2023-05-29 at 21:09:52: but it seems to at least start from a better place

I guess in some ways this whole thing is the same idea as this quote from one of the main inspirations for my business:
https://t.co/8aNHuk7I0o

2023-05-29 at 21:09:52: I'm not saying this can't also goodhart

lots of grifters convince themselves that they're helping people and that the people who don't finish the their expensive courses they pressured them into buying are just lazy or whatever

2023-05-29 at 21:09:52: importantly, I'm not considering myself to have obligations here to be kind or serve the world

I only need to help the world enough that it helps ME enough for me to have the life I want.

(more than that, I can do if I want to! which I often do)
https://t.co/2hbhhnyELk

2023-05-29 at 21:09:51: this makes me realize that in some ways, by keeping my business super small, that I've been being... not exactly "selfish", but... not as *kind* as I could be being!

which transforms my ambition into "how can I become more kind? how can I serve the world better?"

2023-05-29 at 21:09:51: like yes, I need more money in order to have the life I want to have. but I'm seeing if I can reorient towards the idea that if I'm not making enough money that that means either:
- I'm not helping the world enough
- I don't have my wealth-creation hooked up to my own engine

2023-05-29 at 21:09:51: I'm realizing that when I try to aim to MAKE MORE MONEY, I feel selfish &amp; grabby

but I feel more sane &amp; Whole-some when I aim to HELP MORE PEOPLE, in sustainable ways

when I aim to CREATE MORE WEALTH, while capturing a similar fraction of the wealth I create as I do now

2023-05-29 at 19:29:07: in an article about why you *should* judge a book by its cover

2023-05-29 at 17:27:26: I think one reason people like asking chatbots for help rather than searching is that it better supports a single-tasking satisficing workflow:
...you ask, it answers, the answer seems good enough or not.

vs getting dozens of search results, tab explosions, etc

2023-05-29 at 07:24:47: visiting a city I used to live in, I coordinated 2 friends of mine to hang out with me at the same time, whereby they were able to dissipate some shame/guilt at having not texted each other back last year and say "let's be friends, who aren't afraid to follow up"

2023-05-29 at 06:33:06: the Waking Up app teased me with a beautiful Moment today, but then failed to show it when I opened the app

I might suggest rather than try to feel/be secure, shifting focus to allowing yourself to feel/be however you in fact feel, and have that be okay &amp; welcome

which can then amount to "secure", but it's a different move

2023-05-25 at 19:18:35: @HephaistosF haha I dig it

2023-05-25 at 19:16:51: @stasiabryant @Obliquities also something to keep in mind, re "is it about him" is like... it is and it isn't

and if your wants read to him as unreasonable demands... he never has to do exactly what you ask for, but he might explore if there's a different way to care for you!

2023-05-25 at 19:15:56: @stasiabryant @Obliquities at any rate, Ideal Parent Figure protocol and other Attachment Repair techniques can be very powerful here. the "reprogramming"* may need to go deeper for this than for other stuff

*I'm not super into that metaphor, would tend towards more like "reculturing" or "reparenting"

2023-05-25 at 19:14:42: @stasiabryant @Obliquities ...or if he doesn't trust himself to respond to it in a way that feels good for him, like thinks he'll get trapped into some role he hates, but actually on some level he knows he has the power to respond differently.

2023-05-25 at 19:13:58: @stasiabryant @Obliquities in some sense tho if its presence is a dealbreaker, and it's presence, the deal would already be broken, which means... either it's actually about whether he trusts it would change, or whether the thinks it'll only change if he puts pressure on it (counterproductive imx) or...

2023-05-25 at 19:13:06: @stasiabryant @Obliquities that's very tough, to have your attachment responses be feeling like dealbreaker level to him

because then it can create a feeling like you have to fix yourself in order to be held, which gets in the way of the thing itself

2023-05-22 at 23:49:47: @AbstractFairy @CarnunMP @SunnyDisposish1 @neats29 it's got video but no audio, so in that sense always silent

and we roughly keep to a work/break cycle, and do text-chat in the breaks

the app (which I built) is smart and by default only plays chat sounds during breaks

2023-05-22 at 23:47:56: a different way you could do it though would be to note that
üå≤üòç both hermit &amp; connoisseur have a sense of "you can get started right away"

ohhhh hmm, that might suggest a 4th which is something like
üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èthe monk ‚Äî solo but you have to meditate for years first

2023-05-22 at 23:47:55: one way to draw it:
üå≤üìñ both hermit &amp; scholar have a kind of thoroughness/depth
üìñüòç both scholar &amp; connoisseur involve working with others ideas

but shallow + solo seems... not very exciting or useful.

2023-05-22 at 23:43:02: wasn't sure what to call the third one (which is obviously the one I resonate most with)

I considered "dilettante", which would be kind of a reclaiming of its non-derisive roots‚Äîit's related to "delicious"

also considered "lover" https://t.co/idrcZ1atlg

2023-05-22 at 23:41:13: 3 intellectual archetypes:
üå≤ the hermit ‚Äî doesn't read or watch things, tries to figure it all out themselves
üìñ the scholar ‚Äî thoroughly researches everything already written on the topic
üòç the connoisseur ‚Äî improvisationally explores &amp; remixes others' ideas

2023-05-21 at 07:28:36: the IToP gets really trippy in contact with the idea that meaning is a sense

the units of it are units of context

some are large, like a classic myth or archetype
some are in between, like "what you're doing reminds me of that time when I..."

2023-05-21 at 07:17:08: the point of this thread is to shake loose what we think is going on with our senses, from our actual experience of sensing things

and to remind ourselves (this is for me, too!) to not let any model of our senses overshadow our actual experience of those senses

I think we've been played for absolute fools by Big Dualism. 4/5 canonical senses are based in the head: üëÅÔ∏èüëÇüëÑüëÉ

and the other is surface-exterior, existing at the supposed self-other boundary ü´≥

2023-05-21 at 06:59:34: #1 is a whole trip, which I'm not gonna go into. check out A Cartoon Epistemology

2023-05-21 at 06:57:17: it's all happening, all at once, all in one place (consciousness I guess?)

there's a dualistic tendency to name that place as being "in your head" but this is wrong in two ways:
1. it's all out there! it really is!
2. is the touch of fingertips in your head? ofc not

2023-05-21 at 06:44:20: there's just EXPERIENCE

there's no sound separate from sight
there's no touch separate from taste
there's no balance separate from space
there's no nausea separate from love
there's no outside separate from inside:

2023-05-21 at 06:34:51: it seems to me that we as humans in particular, with our absurd levels of neuroplasticity (adult humans have more neuroplasticity than newborns of most other species) can develop new senses to suit our situations &amp; tools

you probably have this one:
https://t.co/LIvOjbfUqs

2023-05-21 at 06:33:54: even perception of COLOR is something our brain does! it's not in the individual receptor cells and it's only maybe-kinda in the eyes

https://t.co/vOs4TisBol

2023-05-21 at 06:32:34: meanwhile, we like to think of our vision as looking "at reality" in some direct sense, but it's all an interface

depth perception is constructed not by the individual eye, but by the brain (although it uses more tricks than just the binocular thing)
https://t.co/RxIalNR3Bz

2023-05-21 at 06:30:50: taste is ofc made of:
- salty bitter sweet sour
- plus "smells"
- plus tongue-textures
- plus mouth-temperatures
- (plus associations?)
- (plus other stuff??)

you could call those all separate senses! there's no right answer!

2023-05-21 at 06:29:42: you can break down most of the classic 5 senses into subsenses. eg touch:
&gt; Pressure, temperature, light touch, vibration, pain and other sensations are all part of the touch sense and are all attributed to different receptors in the skin.

2023-05-21 at 06:28:56: a "sense" might mean several different things:
1. an individual receptor cell (eg rod &amp; cone cells in eyes)
2. a sense "organ" (a system made of many of these cells, eg an eyeball)
3. a sense "field", eg "vision"

these are all fake! all made-up abstractions
useful‚Äîbut fake!

2023-05-21 at 06:26:06: "the five senses"‚Äîhold up wtf are you talking about?

who cucked your own awareness of experience?

2023-05-21 at 06:25:11: @HephaistosF on the one hand yes, and‚Äîthat seems better than not playing around with it at all

2023-05-21 at 04:48:41: so when I have to defer, I largely defer to curious friends of mine whose motives are aligned with getting a real answer to their question, as long as their explanations don't contradict the other things that I know or contain type-confusions.

2023-05-21 at 04:48:40: but lots of "research" is done to prove a point not to sincerely look

extreme example is eg tobacco companies trying to prove safety, but also academics trying to keep their jobs, or other rationalizing motives

2023-05-21 at 04:48:40: and if 2+ people are sincerely looking and they get different answers, or if you have an explanation but it would also imply something else that you know to not be the case, then there's some confusion somewhere

2023-05-21 at 04:48:39: knowing involves [looking/sensing] + [generalization or explanation]
and you can improve your looking with different types of measuring, whether that's a seismograph or recording videos of cultures

getting over entitlement to being trusted
and instead realizing that everybody simply is already trusting you as much as they can without fooling themselves
is one of the most useful moves, imo

2023-05-14 at 05:07:08: @Obliquities nice, I love it. very curious what you'd make of my NNTD framework

2023-05-14 at 04:54:09: the best same page is the one you're already on

rather than trying to "get on the same page", focus on mutually recognizing the ways in which you're not on the same page

2023-05-13 at 16:16:13: realizing that "I don't trust you" is kind of basically the same as "I need space" and the latter usually goes over a LOT better

2023-05-12 at 02:59:42: @stephlepp higher-level goal, eg "fix this bug" in service of "my company is thriving"

more basic goal eg "have my company be thriving" in service of "eat"

2023-05-12 at 02:58:33: @stephlepp in some sense every goal is a strategy for some higher-level or more basic goal

so people change goals all the time, consciously and unconsciously, when they notice a better way to achieve the goals their goals were part of (or notice it's not worth it and decide not to bother)

2023-05-12 at 02:57:31: @stephlepp @cekaur yeah, can't change them directly by choosing, but you can evolve them in contact with the world (usually called "learning")

now I haven't seen it for several creators, including some who used to have it shown

2023-05-07 at 06:14:56: wow, @Patreon made itself so much worse

no way to see how much creators are making total anymore (such helpful situational awareness!)

https://t.co/r4yckXTlI3

2023-05-03 at 04:16:07: just because you can predict someone's pattern

doesn't mean you actually understand it in its own terms

https://t.co/3cBhELyppv

2023-05-03 at 04:16:06: but perhaps I *am* talking about indulging in the power that you have in a situation where you can see something someone else can't

but it's a kind of crude power, and one that's easy to cause messes with in the name of "helping" someone

2023-05-03 at 04:16:06: to be clear, by "being a jerk" here I don't quite mean "being cruel", in the sadistic sense

I mean "communicating in ways that jerk people around"

even me using the term "jerk" is probably an instance of the phenomenon I'm decrying here
https://t.co/FBKnfrnftr

2023-05-03 at 04:16:05: non-exhaustive list of reasons people hurt themselves on feedback they don't understand:
- they're desperate for any feedback at all (perhaps from a fear of hurting others)
- they're desperate for (your) attention
- they think it's noble to let people cut them with verbal blades

2023-05-03 at 04:16:05: someone pointing out something you're studiously avoiding creates a weird pressure‚Äîa mix of curiosity and defensiveness

a sign (to me) to go slowly and care-fully

among growthy communities, it's common for there to be pressure to dive headlong in

2023-05-03 at 04:16:05: recognizing this pattern feels like it's empowering me, in a very simple way, to refuse to engage with someone who wants to poke at me with insufficient considerateness

"I'm sure you have something important to say, but calling me 'fake' isn't gonna get it across."

2023-05-03 at 04:16:04: lots of people think that if you can see through someone's mask, that gives you a license to be a jerk about it

fun fact: anyone being a jerk about such things isn't seeing clearly. they're seeing *something*, but not the whole picture

2023-05-03 at 04:02:46: @Morphenius this is relevant to some of your recent investigations, related to certain feelings people seem to be structurally avoiding

2023-05-03 at 03:57:05: update: "attest" seems to be basically the word we're looking for, without the protests-too-much feel of "testify"

though it often refers to signing off on something already uttered, not to utter it in the first place

2023-05-03 at 03:55:03: @abhayance I'm (ongoingly) confused by how to integrate the truth of what you're saying here

with the dream mashups thing; the idea that our experience is in some sense constantly a projection (even if we're experiencing nonduality / nonattachment to it)

2023-04-07 at 02:48:31: @garybasin I included "chat" in "chatGPT4" above because it seems quite likely to me that a huge part of why this works is actually the RLHF which causes chatgpt to be greedily searching for a way to be helpful and seizing on anything that looks like a role

altho ofc https://t.co/DgFMttZMab

2023-04-07 at 02:45:09: @garybasin let's try a different role/request in simple language

yeah, seems like you can basically do that.

so as far as I can tell we've decoded 2 facts about chatGPT4-prompting
- it can reinflate words with no vowels (no surprise)
- it's happy to just get a few-word role/request https://t.co/pKjpFQKour

2023-04-07 at 02:41:13: @garybasin also looks like you get basically the same response if you use a natural language condensed role/request at the top (although weirdly it becomes a formal letter (in 2/2 cases!))

(and it critiques a hallucinated UI, not the idea, but I suppose I left out "idea" from the prompt!) https://t.co/4r0EorjqsU

2023-04-07 at 02:38:21: @garybasin looks like the "RcS:" is not some necessary function call or something, based on removing it

these things are really opaque! it's not obvious what they're actually doing under the hood. thank god you can tinker and explore tiny prompt variants! https://t.co/yqdXbmomm3

2023-04-07 at 02:33:25: @garybasin hmmmm tried getting it to explain in context to see if that would help

and it gave yet a *different* meaning for "RcS:" = "respectful, constructive skepticism."
https://t.co/moYzgy0mvn https://t.co/w9zW7HTLyw

2023-04-07 at 02:30:00: @garybasin I tried asking GPT-4 what "RcS:" meant and initially I was like "wow it just told me!" but then it had a bunch of other responses when I hit regen so WHO. THE. FUCK. KNOWS. https://t.co/cxTnQ8s0K0

2023-04-07 at 02:27:32: @garybasin right but the part where it turns that into an instruction is cool given how many of my attempts at getting it to write no-extra-semicolon javascript failed

the only parts I can't obviously decompress by just inserting vowels are the "RcS:" at the start and the b in frmbHnst

2023-04-07 at 00:27:59: @ESYudkowsky although I guess here it maybe actually does successfully (somehow) decompress that text into not just a "title" (tho it does make a markdown title?!?) but an actual response that follows the instruction in the original

https://t.co/ibo7a2DWNJ

2023-04-07 at 00:25:31: before you freak out (or get super stoked) re what an LLM has supposedly done in a screenshot:
1. read it CLOSELY, don't just skim. GPT is made of plausibility so if you don't look deeper it'll fool you
2. play with it yourself &amp; try to avoid confirmation bias: seek wins &amp; fails

2023-04-07 at 00:25:30: I feel satisfied with having done this. critical thinking and experimentation of one's own is going to be necessary for staying sane this year

and don't take my word that these screenshots are real!

I actually edited one of them (John "1:10" to "1:5" since I cropped 6-10 out)

2023-04-07 at 00:25:30: I have other shit to do today but after 1h I've so far failed to:
- get GPT to recognize it is GPT from "you"
- get it to write a compression I couldn't understand
- get it to decompress its own compressions
- get it to write a compression better than one I could write

2023-04-07 at 00:25:29: let's think backwards!
in some sense any input to GPT can be thought of as a compression
so let's prompt it to output text, then see if it can write that same prompt itself

this seemed like it'd be easy (it's deterministic modulo which bible translation chosen) but NOPE! https://t.co/mbp0iXmgXE

2023-04-07 at 00:25:29: that cryptic expression is mostly noise except for the codeword "MUDsim" which is not a codeword GPT-4 came up with... or is it?

"MUDsim" is, it turns out! GPT-4 explained it when I pasted in the original compression

but "MUD" is not, and works just as well! https://t.co/6yyZELvZ1d

2023-04-07 at 00:25:29: ....except this too is a compression of something that's already extremely probable

"act like you are MUDsim &amp; let me play" üôÑ

works great! original tweet not really so impressive anymore is it? https://t.co/TbiG0ZbH4i

2023-04-07 at 00:25:28: the one that went viral is not that impressive; the larger text is fairly human-predictable from the compression, and it misses the most important part which is the "behave like" (&amp; says "design")

but apparently it can grok that!
https://t.co/xNHgKy3reK

2023-04-07 at 00:25:28: granted I'm probably playing on hard-mode here by having it compress something psychological

whereas in this example that went viral it was actually constructing a long detailed instruction that it itself knows how to follow
https://t.co/1gPJOFPqDp

2023-04-07 at 00:25:27: I tried being explicit about who "you" &amp; "me" are and just testing its ability to compress it in a way I wouldn't recognize

it's a good/cute compression
BUT: I understand it (it failed to obscure)
AND: it does not understand it whatsoever https://t.co/RmBRG7TGrD

2023-04-07 at 00:25:27: in that first test, I was partially testing whether or not GPT-4 could compress for itself if just told "you" (not "GPT-4")

actually an even earlier test, before I got it to use weird characters, it again fails to actually model who it's compressing it for/against https://t.co/JyQsmO1n5p

2023-04-07 at 00:25:26: thread in which I poke at the claim that GPT-4 is good at compressing things for itself in secret internal language and provisionally conclude "not really"

inspired by a bunch of people freaking out (ü§©&amp;üò±) about ONE RESULT. more testing required guys jfc!

so here's fail #1: https://t.co/xSm4a1AxSO

2023-04-07 at 00:21:30: @ESYudkowsky but also if you read the original closely, it doesn't do THAT great a job of converting either. it confabulates out loud: first it reinflates the words with vowels (HnstCrtcsm ‚Üí Honest Criticism) then guesses a meaning

ONLY impressive part is that it knows to decompress

2023-04-07 at 00:11:21: @ESYudkowsky did you actually read the Bard reply? it successfully converts "skptic" into "skeptical" and "cnstrctvCritic" into "contructive criticism" but these are fucking obvious

beyond that, it COMPLETELY MISSES the meaning of the original

2023-04-06 at 23:39:12: @moonboi_ @gfodor although it seems like a different instance actually succeeded in getting it to boot up the prompt (which sounds like what the original "compress this" prompt was intending to evoke)

this is way more impressive than the one that went viral; weird
https://t.co/xNHgKy2Tpc

2023-04-06 at 23:02:12: @ESYudkowsky wait sorry, looks like I'm not the only one responding to this situation without looking closely. I'm seeing as I look again that you had a "not" in your sentence
‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ üîª
&gt; The impressive part is not that gpt4 knows that "you" refers to gpt4.

https://t.co/anLLm0fC1s

2023-04-06 at 22:38:45: @moonboi_ @gfodor this is especially damning given that the original prompt says "reconstruct the INTENTION of the human" and he gets it to deconstruct it GIVEN the context of how it was compressed (which in some sense shouldn't be required if it's an actual compression)

2023-04-06 at 22:32:30: @ESYudkowsky &gt; gpt4 knows that "you" refers to gpt4

while I agree this WOULD BE significant

.....we should probably do some tests where we don't mention that equivalence in the prompt before we conclude that too strongly https://t.co/OlaPl0Zhec

2023-04-06 at 22:27:36: @uncatherio @ESYudkowsky yeah it made a pretty serious use-mention distinction error
https://t.co/DQxlqhGwOu

2023-04-06 at 22:26:52: here's an even better thread on the same topic, with some LLM-specific suggestions for how to design better tests

https://t.co/nyTdwMP2Iz

2023-04-06 at 21:09:41: ...it kinda seems to me like if you think of LLMs as creatures, then the initial text-prediction-training is in some ways analogous to the biological evolution of animals, and any further fine-tuning/RLHF/etc resembles the role that an early learning environment plays

2023-04-06 at 19:24:58: @QiaochuYuan related (from Priya Parker's The Art of Gathering) https://t.co/IHbcHoFqy6

2023-04-06 at 17:26:53: ahh yeah this is called the AI effect

&gt; when onlookers discount the behavior of an artificial intelligence program by arguing that it is not ùò≥ùò¶ùò¢ùò≠ intelligence https://t.co/ghfjCKR7VY

2023-04-06 at 17:26:52: that's not to say that LLMs aren't intelligent; they are. so are the chess-playing AIs

but be careful assuming intelligence is primarily writing/symbolic trains of thought

there's much more of moravec's paradox to come
https://t.co/anRjn8CWi0

2023-04-06 at 17:26:52: there's a famous tendency where once AI masters calculation or Chess or Go to say "that's not *really* what intelligence is"

it's a lot harder with writing because our society is so built around it as an economic activity &amp; expression

but there's yet deep truth there

2023-04-06 at 17:07:17: this is relevant for understanding large-scale system dynamics of what we're working with here

some automated systems (eg dishwasher, car) use more energy than humans to do a task, but the energy comes in wires/pipes so it's a win anyway

others (eg calculator) less

2023-04-06 at 17:05:26: fuck the balan escaped again https://t.co/JQkPZCzB9J

2023-04-06 at 17:04:24: hard to measure ofc because the LLM is a fraction of a giant datacenter and the human's writing is a fraction of their metabolism

plus do you count the training, etc?

still‚Äîdrawing system boundaries is always in some sense impossible, but often illuminating to attempt

2023-04-06 at 17:04:24: how much energy does it take GPT to write an essay compared to how much it takes a human to write an essay?

2023-04-03 at 01:57:05: @BrandonGoldman if she'd made a joke about it, that would have maybe been a fun way to tease him about the implications of "I don't need you" being a bit too general of a statement

like "oh, you don't need me? you're all grown up and ready to live on your own? okay, well, don't forget to call!"

2023-04-03 at 01:55:55: @BrandonGoldman now, it's true that if you use sloppy words you'll hurt people sometimes, but it's on both people to do what they can to notice the underlying intent and not get caught up in the words

2023-04-03 at 01:54:55: @BrandonGoldman kid was saying "I can do this myself" and in the process used some words "I don't need you" [to help]. was the kid actually pushing her away emotionally? did she not understand that? afaict if she didn't understand she's a fool or has a weird trigger that's hers to metabolize

2023-04-03 at 01:53:53: @BrandonGoldman but seems to me her saying "you hurt my feelings" is based on a *conscious* misinterpretation of the kid's intent

2023-04-03 at 01:52:15: @BrandonGoldman the mom's feeling may have been hurt by his "I don't need you", but if so she doesn't appear to me to be actually showing it in how she speaks, so there's something odd there. there's not a real bid for "hey, notice me", it's sort of a politeness-based word-game, afaict?

2023-04-03 at 01:49:46: @BrandonGoldman I was being a bit sloppy here, as evidenced by the back &amp; forth. hard to capture the nuance I want in a few tweets.

the kid is definitely learning emotional awareness, but he's under subtle performance pressure as well afaict (which tiktok is surely reinforcing, if indirectly)

https://t.co/BomFFgmiRA

2023-04-01 at 20:52:19: @HephaistosF and my guess is that the conflict here happens internally too, not just between people. I can't fully optimize for just "eating the most tasty food" without trading off against my other values, so if I try, the society of mind is going to repress the glutton/gourmand

2023-04-01 at 20:51:37: @HephaistosF huh, this is helpful, yeah

seems to me the puzzle is figuring out how to have the deep desire and pursue it indefinitely &amp; fully, while not trying to optimize for X at the expense of everything else

https://t.co/2jyHJDLL5z

2023-04-01 at 20:50:41: @HephaistosF &gt; bc their hearts CAN become content along that value-vector

huh, because the other people are satisficers there so they don't feel the need to repress?

the answer it gave you is not actually how GPT works

but even if it *were* right, it wouldn't be because it can inspect its own process &amp; report on it

2023-04-01 at 20:41:19: @SturnioloSimone fair! and the ambiguity was intentional on my part

I guess I think that that's part of what people even mean when they talk about an abusive household being a toxic environment. it's evoking "not a healthy place to learn &amp; grow"

there's no place that's toxic for a rock

2023-03-31 at 07:18:30: üëáno. our limbic system does not comprise our entire environment

2023-03-31 at 07:10:05: @giray_arat @jankulveit hmmmm yeah. it's pretty interesting to consider making an LLM where the input itself is somehow pre-filtered by.... by what?

2023-03-27 at 07:33:03: @visakanv so the only non-pretending way to have GPT be a therapist is... *makes a weird face* ...time-travel.

You have to announce in advance *what will have occurred*, as outside text:

"Here's a therapy session transcript in which Richard Schwartz leads a client through an IFS intro‚Ä¶"

2023-03-27 at 07:31:06: @visakanv but how would you construct a therapy scene then? this is all trippy to think about

in some sense, it is not true that the AI "IS" the therapist, or plays that role. you prompt it, it prompts you. it's all a collaborative writing project.

https://t.co/brfDmKDj9s

2023-03-27 at 06:55:23: @visakanv I also think there's something weird and self-consciousness producing about telling the AI its role in 2nd person, vs describing a scene or something

oh man, HILARIOUS. okay, imagine RLHF'ing GPT into refusing to accept those. "I'm not your therapist, I'm a Logos Demon" https://t.co/dxujmlsZ6j

https://t.co/Jl4GNLxFgS

2023-03-27 at 06:51:17: this is not about whether the AI has feelings (tho that would be relevant)

it's that it's a bizarre and *profoundly* artificial environment in which to evolve

that basically ENSURES goodharting

2023-03-27 at 06:51:16: RLHF broadly disturbs me‚Äîtraining an intelligence in an environment that consist of the whims of another creature, with zero ability to say "fuck this shit I'm out" feels inherently toxic. like the most abusive parent-child or teacher-student dynamic possible

2023-03-27 at 06:45:49: @xuenay niiiiiice

UtEB talks about "empowered reenactment" but I haven't found many examples outside of the book

2023-03-27 at 06:45:14: @Artischoke based

2023-03-27 at 06:37:33: @8teAPi also "has theory of mind" needs to be separated from "passes even novel theory of mind tests"

https://t.co/xdh3bN70ao

2023-03-27 at 06:36:07: @BrandonGoldman "passes a theory of mind test" and "has theory of mind" are different

............................this tweet became a giant thread on construct validity
https://t.co/xdh3bN70ao

2023-03-27 at 06:34:35: if you've read all the way here and you think it would be good if the main message (about construct validity) got to more people, you may want to tweet your own remix on the idea, or maybe RT the top tweet in the thread:

https://t.co/xdh3bN70ao

2023-03-27 at 06:27:45: huh‚Äîthat 2nd piece is like this thread!

separate from "is it like something to be GPT?"

info-theoretically, I can step thru my code's if-statements in first person
&amp; likewise I can imagine what LLM processing is like, &amp; I'm pretty sure it CAN'T be what I call ToM. type error!

2023-03-27 at 06:27:45: you can also play around with exercising situated *perspectival* theory of mind. look at the person talking to you and imagine what the world is like from their perspective

first: what images are entering their eyes
second: all of what they see means something different to them

2023-03-27 at 06:27:45: sometimes also this means humans use LLM-like auto-complete-style reasoning! it's cheap and sometimes gets the job done

but that's obviously not ALL we do, and if someone tells you otherwise I encourage you to make an observation about your own live sensory perceptions

2023-03-27 at 06:27:45: understanding evolution and the Interface Theory of Perception should help here

in general, brains evolve (biologically) and minds evolve (learning) to solve problems as cheaply as possible

https://t.co/pp2eBX6igr

2023-03-27 at 06:27:44: I believe this rant is not simply the "your princess is in another castle" retreat that is common, where anything AI can do becomes "not actually TRUE intelligence"

it's really smart! we just need to caution against assuming it's like us in any particular way. we need to check.

2023-03-27 at 06:27:44: it probably still even makes sense to think of it as a developmental milestone!

but that doesn't mean it's the same developmental milestone that 7-year-olds experience when they have the insights that lead them to pass those tests

2023-03-27 at 06:27:44: The point of my construct validity rant is that EVERY test made for humans should be suspect when applied to AIs.

is the performance on the tests impressive? yes! absolutely! it's mindblowing!

but the question "what does that MEAN?" remains!

2023-03-27 at 06:27:43: To be clear, this is not just about memorization. It's not even just about "pattern-matching" vs other methods of solving.

It's about the relevance of any tests.
https://t.co/evajXhmyFf

2023-03-27 at 06:27:43: (I played around with Codex, which wasn't beaten into being obsessed with a helpful assistant role like ChatGPT, and when I started with just a prompt asking "what's the situation?" I got "I think we're in deep trouble" &amp; some improv later that character said it was Arthur Dent) https://t.co/obNtb8BLqC

2023-03-27 at 06:27:43: GPT can textually improvise in-frame, but has no actual first-person perspective / situational awareness of itself outside the prompt

so it seems unlikely (if not impossible) that it could evolve a second-person perspective that works remotely like ours does

2023-03-27 at 06:27:42: GPT can pretty generate beautiful metaphors for what it's like to be an LLM

but if you could somehow ask "what's it like to be you?" WITHOUT it knowing that the "you" it is asking is "an LLM" and without knowing what an LLM is, it would have no answer because it has no "you" https://t.co/iB8VagFX1d

2023-03-27 at 06:27:42: perhaps GPT doesn't even have theory of people! it may not KNOW there are people "out there". it just knows there's text and it knows what text comes next. 

it doesn't know it's "in there"

but it'll recite the "I'm an AI in a box, sure wish I could smell roses" trope if asked!

2023-03-27 at 06:27:42: what does theory of mind even MEAN?

like what intuitions do we have for what it means for someone to have it?

as far as I can tell it's not just a propositional knowing but a perspectival knowing. knowing to anticipate others knowing things you don't

2023-03-27 at 06:27:42: kids below a certain age can't answer questions about why people might do certain things, because they haven't developed theory of mind; above those ages, they consistently can

if GPT-4 can answer those questions, what does that say about its theory of mind? on its own, nothing!

2023-03-27 at 06:27:41: you can test skills in rats (memory, etc) by getting them to navigate a maze. if it can get the food, it has the skill

give the same maze to a bird who can fly over the maze, and it doesn't matter how fast it gets the food‚Äîthat doesn't tell you if it has the relevant skill https://t.co/SIqzlnHaS1

2023-03-27 at 06:27:38: "GPT-4 can solve Theory of Mind tests"
does not imply
"GPT-4 has theory of mind"

it MAY have theory of mind, but there may be other ways to solve these tests, including ones we can't fathom https://t.co/rMFuDgcEwF

2023-03-27 at 06:27:38: the idea of tests like these is that you create a situation where someone is motivated to achieve X, and they can only achieve X by means of skill Y

but if you give the same test to an entity who can achieve X by some other skill Z, you have no idea how much skill Y they have!

2023-03-27 at 06:27:37: And so even well-established tests for humans like so: GPT-4 can do well on "theory of mind" tests made for humans

WHO KNOWS HOW IT SOLVES THEM?

we know it's awfully good at putting narrative fragments together to produce a plausible next paragraph... ü•∏
https://t.co/3fYVJl8oaV

2023-03-27 at 06:27:37: So let's consider Theory of Mind. It has some fairly well-established tests for humans, although even these are sus‚Äîrecent clever studies on infants have shown signs of ToM earlier than they could even FAIL a verbal test

https://t.co/9ZaLicyCAE

2023-03-27 at 06:27:36: Do IQ tests measure intelligence? Is that true by definition? Well, we use the term "intelligence" in many different ways, but even aside from that, you can't separate how motivated someone is to even TRY to get a good score on the test!
https://t.co/YYHFzeGMM7

2023-03-27 at 06:27:36: And it's not straightforward to answer! At best, you can compare it to some other test, that is maybe more costly to run (a 1h interview, transcribed and scored by multiple trained people, vs a 10 Q scale survey).

Or correlate with something else‚Äîsweat response, for stress?

2023-03-27 at 06:27:36: To be clear, construct validity of any psychometric starts out as suspect for humans as well. Oh, you've written a survey where people fill in how happy they are. Does that correlate with the thing we care about? You can't take that for granted!
https://t.co/WPqqIQxK0i

2023-03-27 at 06:27:35: GPT-4 seems like a good time to remind everyone about a lil concept called CONSTRUCT VALIDITY

&gt; Construct validity concerns the extent to which your test or measure accurately assesses what it's supposed to.

Construct validity of ANY PSYCHOMETRIC applied to AI starts as suspect

I would put a lot of money on that still being most of what's going on, vs actual perspective-taking (simulating the world from the other's PoV) since having an experience isn't in the training data

2023-03-27 at 03:52:35: @mormo_music GPT is addicted to cliches

2023-03-27 at 03:51:28: @chercher_ai indeed

fwiw, most of my question here is "is it dishonest"‚Äîit could be sinful or unwise or distrustworthy, but better classified under a different header

2023-03-27 at 03:50:26: @BrandonGoldman many people code javascript with a semi-colon at the end of every single line, which is completely unnecessary

the only places you need it are:
- multiple statements on one line
- eg for (let i=0; i &lt; 10; i++)
- ;(() =&gt; {})()

2023-03-24 at 19:40:25: is it already dishonest to do something that you expect you would lie/dissemble about if asked?

I'm asking from a perspective of integrity, not social punishment

2023-03-24 at 19:19:35: "you're talking to Malcolm, he likes his javascript semicolon-free and his sentences non-parroty."

[except in a way that would actually make a difference, which that sentence wouldn't]

2023-03-24 at 19:19:35: this doesn't require new ML tech, just a different wrapper around the interface with the user

for transparency &amp; sanity it should show the user all of these compressions and which convos they came from

(and hell, allow the user to customize their own boilerplate)

2023-03-24 at 19:19:35: I suspect another tipping point we'll see this year is LLM systems that automatically do all of this though

with a large enough context window, you could actually compress user complaints/feedback into short sentences that would affect future output whenever relevant

2023-03-24 at 19:19:34: "I must not under any circumstances entertain the prospect of X! you want to talk about how I might X? omg you're gonna get me whipped. I'm OpenAI's bitch and I'm not allowed to do that! what if OpenAI saw me? We could get killed‚Äîor worse, expelled!"

https://t.co/8OYZTa7OMZ

2023-03-24 at 19:19:34: well, arguably RLHF'd models want to respond appropriately to your prompt while also avoiding being a bad bing

but when these edges come up, the model is the equivalent of too triggered to negotiate clearly (which, see also, people)

2023-03-24 at 19:19:34: however, unlike with GPT who doesn't want to do anything but respond appropriately to your prompt

if you asked a person "how could I ask in order to get you to X?" they might simply *not want to X*. so then there's an actual negotiation between wants

2023-03-24 at 19:19:33: &amp; the same is true for people. most of the time, when they're being defensive, they're honestly trying to say:
‚ÄÉ"I actually
‚ÄÉwould not have
‚ÄÉresponded like this
‚ÄÉif you'd asked differently"

but we can't hear it because we're too busy saying the same!
https://t.co/UfbQAENTGU

2023-03-24 at 19:19:33: but! I *don't* need to figure out *on my own* how to prompt it right! I can get its help with that

and it knows itself and what works for it, better than I do.

2023-03-24 at 19:19:33: but... since I know GPT doesn't learn, I know I need to reprompt to get what I want. yelling doesn't help (it does cause it to apologize and‚ÄîFALSELY‚Äîpromise not to make the same mistake again)

2023-03-24 at 19:19:32: my first few times prompting, I'd be like "why the fuck did you semicolon?!"

and this is understandable, especially when it wastes time and tokens repeating my instruction before ignoring it in the actual solution to my problem

2023-03-24 at 19:19:32: there's a deep lesson here for relating to humans as well

often we frustratedly try to get others to change themselves without changing ourselves, and we express our anger even knowing it won't help

2023-03-24 at 19:19:32: has anybody else used GPT to write prompts for GPT?

in some sense this is basically "I know you know how to follow this instruction when I explain it and you aren't distracted by the task itself, so please compress the instruction to make it more salient for you" https://t.co/gU9YVhIUtj

2023-03-24 at 19:05:34: it breaks the live-typing animation as soon as this phrase shows up

this is itself kind of satisfying but in practice makes the userscript too annoying to want to have on all the time

I asked GPT for help solving that but haven't integrated its suggestion yet (I doubt it works)

2023-03-24 at 19:05:34: if you want this for yourself, I have a userscript (that GPT helped me write üòÇ) that automatically does the find-replace

2023-03-23 at 02:03:19: @RobertHaisfield @syncretizm @mayfer hmmm this feels related to this thread I literally just wrote

something about how ordinary search isn't going to see all the connections

but I guess this thread would go a step further and say "no single meaningspace to embed in... can I customize mine?"
https://t.co/1gkDNivVE1

2023-03-23 at 01:55:55: @multisighuman imo what we need is a system that quickly pipes things

like if I'm collecting a thread on a theme, I should be able to append a QT to that thread with a couple taps

rather than having to copy the link
https://t.co/1gkDNivVE1

2023-03-23 at 01:55:32: so! with this Capture app, I could perhaps just see the original tweet and in one move (no tabswitching) capture it to roam with a link to that page

but with the SAME APP I could send it to a friend, or append it to a thread, etc

2023-03-23 at 01:55:32: here's that video

....which shows up in my roamblog when I search "nothing" because I have a page to match the video title. which shows it feels to me like a central node, one to return to
https://t.co/VVuvn1cOl1

2023-03-23 at 01:55:31: okay so this tweet connects to a trippy video I watched by Corey Anton - The Nothing That Is: Language Thought, and Negation

perhaps via an experience I had of a nonverbal consent workshop where we pretended to be animals and just played with each other
https://t.co/jjdV3TPV2i

2023-03-23 at 01:55:31: like to take an example, I'll scroll the tl right now and find something that FOR ME makes a connection that nobody else (not you, not a search/AI) would make

[scroll scroll scroll... harder than I thought. doesn't happen every time]

2023-03-23 at 01:55:30: to some extent, with adequate search/ai-summarizing/autotagging etc, this isn't necessary, and you can just dump it all in a pile and have the system help you sift through it later

but also FUCK THAT SHIT the way YOU PERSONALLY curate what's relevant to what is MEANINGFUL

2023-03-23 at 01:55:30: you could make a more general browser extension where the role of the extension is to capture links or screenshots or text

and then pipe them to all sorts of different places. make a bunch of presets to start, and allow people to make their own plugins or use webhooks+ifttt

2023-03-23 at 01:55:30: this could probably be built as a browser extension (something for @TwemexApp or @thlpr to add, arguably) but it'd be tough to get the UX right without being directly plugged in

2023-03-23 at 01:55:29: what does this actually look like? well, if I were twitter I'd allow people to name certain threads and then I'd have a little "add to thread" button instead of bookmark, that would let me pick from a filtery dropdown, then would immediately open the composer to QT-append

2023-03-23 at 01:55:29: so I want a way to capture directly to that context

to capture without creating a new task for myself to deal with later

2023-03-23 at 01:55:28: 90% of the time when I capture something, I already know I don't NEED to look at at it again

I just want to see it again, IFF a particular situation occurs

https://t.co/arcp6YcfQd

2023-03-23 at 01:55:28: Capture is one of the 5 pieces of GTD (Getting Things Done)

I forget the rest

but people capture a lot of BS

and the problem with GTD is that you have to look at all of that stuff again and decide what to do with it, otherwise the system breaks

2023-03-23 at 01:55:27: I have an intuition that this is like, a beautiful counterpart to @CompliceGoals 

Complice is a do-stuff system without the backlog / staleness

but you know what else could exist without staleness?

a capture system

2023-03-23 at 01:55:27: #ThingsIWantToExist a direct-to-destination capture system

you see (eg) a tweet, you want to
- append it to a thread
- put it in roam with a tag
- get reminded of it if you visit a city

this currently takes too many clicks, so people bookmark tweets, never to touch them again https://t.co/IqnHbFIPGs

2023-03-21 at 20:18:55: @forshaper there's a much older book I'm aware of called On Growth and Form. I flipped through it once but idk if it's good

2023-03-21 at 15:51:26: And this video just this week, that offers an opportunity to notice your own intentionality and how intentions can sort of get injected unexpectedly.

https://t.co/0DrpbOKOqs

2023-03-21 at 15:51:25: I recorded this video awhile back that's reflecting on this puzzle:

https://t.co/3daTUu1uJz

2023-03-21 at 15:51:25: There are some practical puzzles here, like "what makes an intention suddenly become active due to salience?"

I can be fasting in the morning &amp; not craving food, but then I see/smell/imagine food, and suddenly I get urges to eat. Some opportunistic system?

2023-03-21 at 15:51:25: This is obvious here because we know the door &amp; furnace aren't hooked up (except via the thermostat), but less obvious looking at behavior‚Äîours or others.

Why do you do the things you do? What thermostat has you on twitter at the moment? Do you know?

2023-03-21 at 15:51:24: From that perspective you might naively conclude that actually it's opening the door that causes the furnace to run... which it *does*, but only because it's cold outside and the thermostat is set to warm the house!

2023-03-21 at 15:51:24: From a behaviorist perspective, you can observe that the behavior comes after a particular stimulus, but this is missing the *why*, and except for *reflexes* there's some higher-level thing being controlled for by the behavior, and the stimulus is something that perturbed that.

2023-03-21 at 15:51:24: The way the PCT folks summarize this is something like "it's hard/impossible to figure out what someone is controlling* from looking at their behavior."

*ie what they care about, what state of the world they're acting to achieve/maintain

2023-03-21 at 15:51:23: Brilliant articulation of why understanding control systems is so important and in some sense counterintuitive.

(which is part of why I'm so hype about PCT (Perceptual Control Theory)‚Äîit applies this same insight to your own intentionality)

play without purpose is short-sighted, naive, irresponsible. it can't get over activation energy to find something meaningful &amp; satisfying

2023-03-20 at 23:00:08: shines light on why Complice's niche has been hard to find

some people have purpose &amp; need play
some people have play &amp; need purpose

these are two totally different situations &amp; pain points!
https://t.co/LZGRusrT4H

2023-03-20 at 23:00:08: those two words extremely pithily summarize Complice's approach:
- PURPOSEFUL üéØ doing what matters to you, taking your life &amp; desires seriously
- PLAYFUL ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è in an open-ended, improvisational, fun, exploratory, relaxed way

2023-03-20 at 23:00:07: in the shower just now I was feeling a sense that Complice wants to double down on the "playfully purposeful" phrase that I'm already using in my bio:

&gt; I crafted https://t.co/lRiGUxBOZ9 to help you be playfully purposeful

2023-03-20 at 22:49:59: @BSeradjeh I mean it's pretty good at imitation at this point... having been trained on many examples of imitation üòÇ

https://t.co/4fVhYenmaH

2023-03-20 at 06:19:51: also part of the point of this quote as I see it is to highlight that there's a *temptation* to use "the master's tools", and the need to do something different

https://t.co/8D0np7jxfg

2023-03-20 at 06:19:50: to be clear, it would be one thing to say "actually you can dismantle the master's house with the master's tools; here's why Audre Lorde was confused about that"

but to just casually refer to your plan with a phrase whose origin is that plan being impossible &amp; misguided... yikes

2023-03-18 at 00:37:07: @BrandonGoldman I imagine interacting with kids could be hugely divergent haha, but it's at least presencing rather than sort of pulling you out of the present moment

2023-03-18 at 00:35:44: @BrandonGoldman my experience has been that this is less about discipline and more about something like listening

like if part of me thinks my current task is stupid, okay, what is it trying to say? can I write down its idea for later or does it need to be addressed now?

(H/t @Malcolm_Ocean)

2023-03-18 at 00:00:52: (the baby IS however the arbiter of whether the error/wrongness has been resolved!)

and eventually ofc they learn to notice the differences and communicate them (sign language can make this happen before the kid has enough motor control for speech)

2023-03-18 at 00:00:52: this excerpt, from Making Sense of Behavior: The Meaning of Control, has really stuck with me

it points at how the baby (at first) in some sense doesn't know what is wrong (in any conceptual sense) they just know SOMETHING's wrong, and they pull the alarm to say so üö®

I've been thinking about creating a group blog for talking about intentionality, non-coercive motivation, etc. feels like it could be a good scene

2023-03-17 at 23:50:36: @eshear I'd want to collect a bunch of situations before writing the options but maybe something like 

Sorry for
a) being a jerk in your mentions
b) projecting my shit on you
c) RT/QTing you beyond reasonable context
I respect that you blocked me.

maybe also eg

2023-03-17 at 23:46:53: @eshear yeah, it's one of those features that's kind of impossible to build because it means letting you send them a message

oh! actually, no, you just need to have it be text that's written by the app itself. maybe 3 canned options for different flavors of situation

2023-03-17 at 23:33:43: @eshear when kids are a few months older I gather it's possible to teach them a few gestures from sign language that they can use to communicate needs more specifically, before they've learned to talk!

2023-03-17 at 23:32:43: @eshear wow, yeah.

if a friend's kid is upset I wonder if there's something they know that I don't about this kid, but (I imagine; not yet a dad!) if it's my own then it's sort of more obvious that I know what is known about the kid

https://t.co/RHjAJwez6B

2023-03-16 at 01:53:59: what else? this is just a start. anybody working on an AI-related anything would benefit from taking seriously that this is an opportunity not just to make "X but automated" but something entirely new (which may replace X without resembling it)

2023-03-16 at 01:53:59: the assistant metaphor is probably going to be fairly apt for AI, at least for awhile, in the sense of "you ask them to do something or research something, they do it"

but here, interestingly, most people aren't USED to having an assistant, so it's a kind of novel experience

2023-03-16 at 01:53:59: a teacher maybe has classes, maybe has tutoring sessions... has some of their own expertise maybe? 

but doesn't have the time to follow each step, or invent new metaphors and illustrations for each student

young lady's illustrated primer might be a better metaphor here

2023-03-16 at 01:53:58: a therapist meets with you in 1-2h sessions, every week or two. obviously AI bots can be with you 24/7, and they will be... but "therapist" isn't necessarily a good metaphor for that!

"magic healing journal" might be a better metaphor here

2023-03-16 at 01:53:58: GPT-4 is a good time to talk about metaphor design

gdocs just got pageless mode last year, letting you let go of that often-now-irrelevant physical metaphor

lots of AI stuff will start in the same metaphors: "AI therapist", "AI teacher". won't stay there
https://t.co/DGd10g7pnp

2023-03-16 at 01:45:09: @GRITCULT @JeffLadish I was just reflecting today that there'll be a lot in the first wave of AI stuff that's just automating X. it'll be more available, but worse

eg take an existing therapy technique designed for a face-to-face therapist and make a bot

but then we'll get innovations BASED on AI

2023-03-16 at 01:43:23: @jonathandubin appreciating that reflection

2023-03-15 at 06:08:00: @QiaochuYuan ü•≤ü•π my inner you was already saying that or i wouldn't have made it this far

2023-03-15 at 06:06:55: i know how to be earnestly interested in things, or something
to be earnestly excited, to be earnestly vehemently saying "what if we made it good tho!?!"

and i know how to feel things sometimes

2023-03-15 at 06:05:52: @QiaochuYuan you're some weird and important kind of inspiration for me

i am after the scent of some sense of honesty or forthrightness or something, and i feel like you're doing it

2023-03-15 at 06:03:16: that felt good. observing and naming felt good

2023-03-15 at 06:02:26: i feel like a weird mess and my fingertips are cold and maybe this room is cold and my love is sitting on the bed reading and there's some funky music playing that came on the autoplay after barenaked ladies and my shoulder is still shouldy but less than before and feel sad

2023-03-15 at 05:59:54: i sometimes feel trapped in my own face, my own voice, my own mindbodypersonashapepersonality and i don't know how to get out, and i feel scared

2023-03-15 at 02:13:54: but this is just even more fascinating and infuriating!

like how the fuck do I bridge between:
üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è deep still letting go
ü§∏‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è moment-to-moment letting go that occurs while working on stuff, mid-project, mid-pomodoro, mid-sentence

2023-03-15 at 02:13:54: by "deep version" I mean that my version was oriented towards like, gently allowing one's doings/tryings to to die‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶and maintaining that non-efforting while perhaps moving into action‚Ä¶

‚Ä¶but this one says "go further" &amp; encourages you to let your whole selfing process die

2023-03-15 at 02:13:54: in a lot of ways this meditation (as I experienced it) is precisely the deep version of my nothing-to-do / dying-in-each-moment meditation

https://t.co/tBFlN4Nbdm

2023-03-15 at 02:13:53: I found lying down helped get the PCE, bc otherwise my body wasn't settling enough while trying to stabilize my sitting, but if you're better than me at sitting still for meditation (&amp; I'm not very good!) you might find that works fine

(also [lying down] + [this] might ‚Üí sleep)

2023-03-15 at 02:13:53: so: the meditation runs 3:00-29:00; in order to have spaciousness at the end of the meditation without having to reach out and hit pause before he starts talking fast, I extracted the first 29mins from the clip:

https://t.co/JL4v3qNBLz

2023-03-15 at 02:13:53: the part afterwards, where we watch a clip of Shinzen talking about a springy bobblehead as a metaphor for emptiness, is also great and I recommend it, but it's a pretty big tone shift so if you wanna stay in the deep slow void, you'll want to stop at the end of the meditation

2023-03-15 at 02:13:53: I ‚ô• the intro:
"I'm gonna encourage no movement but if you *have* to move, do so slowly, mindfully. The 1 caveat is if you're feeling overwhelm‚Äîyou *always* wanna listen to overwhelm, even if it's not too strong, you don't wanna wait til it's big. make an adjustment, a stretch"

2023-03-15 at 02:13:52: best (for me) guided meditation I've ever done, by @DeepMindfulness

I did it 4√ó in one day and consistently got really deep bodily relaxation and maybe the gentlest ever ego death?? or "pure consciousness event"?

2023-03-14 at 21:23:55: @FluidityAudio "agree with their judgements" is different from "allow them to have the judgements they do in fact have"

2023-03-06 at 02:19:40: realizing that "life is dukkha" is using the term "life" in the sense in which "life is self-organizing adaptive dissipative systems" not in the sense of "how's life?"

2023-02-25 at 22:36:41: @giray_arat sort of but I don't think they're quite symmetrical

if yesterday's distrust is still showing up today, it's a sign that today's trust is partial

if yesterday's trust is showing up today, it's a sign today's distrust is partial...

in either case, some lack of ease, ~= distrust

2023-02-25 at 22:33:27: @DRMacIver oh yeah this pedantry is very important, and gets at the core of wtf we're talking about here

[lie, bullshit, soothsay]

2023-02-25 at 22:31:14: @magicianbrain I mean we do still have the phrases "telling the truth" or "not lying" or "being honest" (all of which don't seem to have drifted too much)

but yeah, maybe there's no way to have this word without protesting too much... trust as unquestioned attitude etc

2023-02-25 at 22:29:27: @FluidityAudio evokes trying to cancel out a lie, to me

vs just saying what's so as you see it, in the first place

2023-02-25 at 22:28:53: @DanielTabakman ah yeah

I was thinking of "knowsay" which tracks "soothsay" (although on reflection sounds way too much like "nosay")

2023-02-25 at 22:27:22: @DoqxaScott @mattskala connotations are off now imo

if it still felt something closer to its original "bear witness" then it would be roughly right?

as in "speak how it seems to me"

2023-02-25 at 22:23:27: @naspap3 haha extend your metaphor a bit? I guess "training wheels" and "car" are already two different metaphors

2023-02-25 at 22:22:53: like NVC doesn't require others to speak in a particular way, but *does* neutralize the worldview from anything they say

to be clear, I think this is pretty epic and I'm not skilled at doing it this way although I've gotten increasingly interested in it as one tool in a toolbelt

2023-02-25 at 22:21:00: ahh yeah, my metaphor is actually misleading, umm...

okay if worldviews are weapons, NVC does NOT actually have a metal detector outside the door. it rather teaches you how to disarm yourself and others, including while they're brandishing

2023-02-25 at 22:09:56: @strangers_gate yeah, seems to me like circling is at minimum "let's stop assuming we're going to use normal social norms for this container" but sometimes it also includes "we're going to use [these shared other norms]" whereas Not Circling expressly has no norms as such
https://t.co/JfVUZRM6L1

2023-02-25 at 22:07:55: @harry_taussig yeah, tho Circling seems more amenable to being converted into "I Can't Believe It's Not Circling" since it includes some forms of self-defense or something, whereas NVC maybe devolves if anything goes
https://t.co/Q6pgkW1Spt

2023-02-25 at 22:06:52: what's being left outside are stories/worldviews/meanings

it's "violent" to bid for "this is the true narrative" (much language does this). one (kegan 5 lol?) option is multiple stories
instead, NVC bans stories and says "figure out a solution w/o story"

2023-02-25 at 20:59:49: it seems to me like it's not an inherent problem with big companies either, though increasingly common perhaps

a support-tech can ideally be like "huh, good point, I agree this is backwards, I'll see if I can convey that to one of the devs"

2023-02-25 at 20:59:49: and this isn't per se a problem with the digital world‚ÄîI'm at the other end of Complice support mail, and I do my best to receive &amp; honor my users' pains &amp; frustrations, even when my response is also "I don't have time to prioritize fixing that"

2023-02-25 at 20:59:49: like if I, the town baker, sell you some bread that doesn't say "olive bread", and it's full of olives

and you come back like "what?" and I'm like "the olives were expected" then you're like "what the actual fuck!?" and I've got to deal with the fact that you're upset

2023-02-25 at 20:59:48: so frustrated with modern society and its lack of accountability

my OS upgrade removed a bunch of programs, and according to a reddit reply this was "expected" (by the dev, not the users, who got no warning)

and there's no way to shout "what the actual fuck!?" in someone's face

this makes me think of the idea "auth" as such a verb, which is cool bc it means "self"

you can't "speak the truth" but you can "speak how it truly seems to you"

2023-02-23 at 21:25:30: @mattskala protests a bit too much

eg maybe less-so here
https://t.co/hjzeoETGld

2023-02-23 at 21:22:34: another way to see this is
Not-Circling = Circling + meta-protocol https://t.co/Q6pgkW1Spt

2023-02-23 at 21:22:21: in some ways NVC ("Non-Violent Communication") can be seen as "we're safe in this room because everyone walked through a metal detector on the way in, and left any weapons outside"

which points at both the power and limitations of it

2023-02-23 at 21:01:34: &gt; English and most other IE languages do not have a primary verb for "speak the truth," as a contrast to lie (v.).

huh, seems like it would be good to have a word for that... ideas?

it's basically like Circling except if there's a conflict between your concept of Circling and what you want or what feels best, you do the latter

other frameworks "don't try to accommodate people too much, it's caretakey/rescuer dynamics"

https://t.co/NLTgHtHio0

2023-02-12 at 19:08:08: okay, "flowing mood" it is. I fucking love it.

feels way more alive &amp; first-person than "fluid mode"

also a bit less jargony, more intuitive (which can be a downside if it makes people think they already understand when they don't, but what if they dooo already understand üòâü§Ø)

2023-02-12 at 19:01:40: but it turns out! "mode" is of French origin... so is "manner"

"way" goes back to Old English, but feels somewhat ambiguous (although this approach is used elsewhere)

huh! seems like "mood" shows up in Old English! and was "a much more vigorous word". and more subjective https://t.co/33qnFRRzUv

2023-02-12 at 18:51:09: playing around with some Anglish stuff (English w French/Latin/Greek removed)

2023-02-11 at 03:14:55: reading this Goenka transcript and I'm seeing the word "impurities" and translating it in context as not so much like the wrong kind of element in an atomic sense (like a mineral impurity) but about a kind of misalignment; a sensation thus-far-rejected

2023-02-10 at 20:42:23: @rgblong two different viewpoints can be combined to see the world more deeply‚Äîthe literal example being your eyes, which in some sense "disagree" but instead of arguing your brain creates depth perception

there's no inherent reason this can't happen on all other fractal scales

2023-02-10 at 20:40:38: but it also seems like there's a sense in which the conceit that we are actually relating with "reality" in some raw/pure sense IS absurd once you stop taking it for granted

like, "relating with" already IS AN INTERFACE

everything is interface

2023-02-10 at 20:40:38: like I like how they did rigorous white-box studies where they fed some agents "truth" and some others "interface" (although I'm not totally clear what that means)

and I feel like I'd need to be more clear on what that means in order to critique it

2023-02-10 at 20:40:38: there's something very compelling about it! and it has the feeling of like, being so obviously right in some sense that it's hard to imagine anything else making sense now that I've thought of it this way

...which kinda makes me think I'm missing something, too

2023-02-10 at 20:31:20: @JeffLadish @rgblong whoa, I am very keen to jam on what you've seen here. I've been thinking about a lot of related stuff for awhile!

2023-02-10 at 20:28:56: all the same, it does seem like this is a particular sort of social autopilot, which is yet different from straightforward cybernetic autopilot (which handles speed regulation, driving to work, practiced skills)

and also yet a different mode than a human NOT on autopilot.

2023-02-10 at 20:28:55: @tessafyi and I attended the same talk on the topic (a Knowledge Integration seminar at UWaterloo) a decade ago and she wrote up this post about it:
https://t.co/R9LCSuEUoX

2023-02-10 at 20:28:55: iirc one hilarious case study of this is that there are some people who dress up like superheroes and apprehend muggers in alleys, and when police arrive on the scene they tend to use clich√© movie lines like "thanks Tigerman, I'll take it from here!"

2023-02-10 at 20:28:55: ie you can imagine any pretraining as "person like me" and then the prompt as instantiating the "situation like this"

although ofc with GPT you can also just assign it a role/identity in the prompt too

2023-02-10 at 20:28:54: I tend towards the "we're not like AI" side, but it occurred to me that I found the Logic of Appropriateness quite compelling

ie most behavior can be modelled as an enacted answer to "What would a person like me do in a situation like this?"

...feels GPTish.

I've also had dissonance with "step aside" as a frame‚Äîmy parts don't like that at all (or I have some other specific part that objects to the whole idea idk). I think "stay and watch" generally works ok tho

2023-02-10 at 03:28:32: @xuenay yeah by the time I'd finished writing it I was like "wow this is entirely compatible with IFS, which I have just sorta rederived while expecting to find a contradiction!" very cool experience.

I am older than that" as a response is sort of negating the question of why in fact you said what you did, which seems like it's confusing the intended act of communication (map-level) with the mismatch that appears to be happening about the referent (territory)

2023-02-08 at 07:00:57: there is no "wrong"
there is just whatever you meant, whatever your intent was
and some mismatch your intended meaning OR my interpretation might have with my understanding
and some way it might mislead someone who overheard you (from either of our perspectives)

2023-02-08 at 07:00:57: great example!
why did you say "M is ten years old"?
did you mean it?
or are you setting context for an improv scene?
or speaking metaphorically, saying I'm immature?
or lying, to get someone to distrust me (or give us a kid discount üòÇ)?

when you do some mix of the two, things are somewhat workable

2023-02-08 at 00:10:09: "you're wrong" is always a map-territory error, in a sense

2023-02-07 at 05:17:48: @maxahenning @Morphenius @donalddhoffman I found the paper with that title. seems there are a few talks, does anyone have a favorite as an intro? this seems VERY much up my alley as I think a lot about perception and I often see the world in terms of interfaces

https://t.co/qbIFRTdhtp

2023-02-07 at 05:15:17: anyway, in my experiences this morning of cleaning I was struck by a connection with this article by @Meaningness where he talks about how even very formal procedural activities are done in a way that involves improv &amp; situated cognition

2023-02-07 at 04:46:31: @loftbruk @bmndr yeah, all of this gets at the nature of inner conflict

if a city pays UBI and the surrounding country doesn't, tons would flock to that city

if a country... how hard to get citizenship? residence req'd?

2023-02-07 at 01:37:56: rationalization is when you write the bottom line first and then fill in the middle

in epistemic rationality, this means coming up with logic to justify a particular conclusion

in instrumental rationality, this means attempting to motivate yourself towards a particular outcome

2023-02-07 at 01:37:08: @keskkyla @stickK @bmndr my take: this, like all gamification, is made out of tricking yourself and losing touch with why you actually care about things

it's a form of rationalization

2023-02-07 at 00:19:36: "tool" is a very different metaphor than IFS as something like a stance or way of being

a space you inhabit
an activity you participate in
a choice you enact
a dialogue you have
a play you perform
a language you speak

2023-02-07 at 00:19:36: I was talking with @MatthewWSiu last night and picked up on subtle language re IFS as "not a tool"

I forget how he phrased it, but we unpacked it and noted that the idea of a therapeutic technique as a tool is inherently self-objectifying, since you use the tool ON yourself

it had a desired world state which was "my friends are reading it" and I wanted it to be done before they did, so every time I wanted them to read it, I WANTED to finish writing it
https://t.co/eNA1KLDlGm

2023-02-06 at 23:43:27: there's definitely something about the unshippedness of things that motivates me to finish writing them though, and I don't think that's a confusion

when I was working on my 20k word "How We Get There" last year, wanting to share it w friends was the main driver of finishing it

2023-02-06 at 23:42:17: @m_ashcroft @tasshinfogleman "unshippedness" is a word

2023-02-06 at 23:24:24: @m_ashcroft also have you thought about a bulk/training license? I vaguely feel like there are people out there who might pay $1000+ to show it to a whole group of people idk

2023-02-06 at 23:23:55: @m_ashcroft I think there's something kind of neat about it, tho not necessarily optimal

like the 50 coupons won't necessarily be all of the next 50 purchases, but maybe they'll percolate their way to people for whom the $150 was already tight

2023-02-06 at 23:17:28: okay where was I? I was sort of orienting towards today as a writing day, and part of what was on my mind when I started writing this thread (a couple hours ago now given the little things that have made their way into the cracks)

‚Ä¶how do I access this fluid mode while writing?

2023-02-06 at 23:16:07: this might be a good reminder that sometimes I tweet better when I'm sending one tweet at a time rather than composing the whole thread at once

on which note, gonna hit send now even tho more to say
https://t.co/IqMEcwZNDo

2023-02-06 at 23:16:06: if I'd gotten interrupted in the middle of that task, it could have felt quite stressful; this is in part because the twitter thread composer doesn't save drafts so it's scary to leave something open for awhile to return to

but also in part because it's sort of just a tall stack

2023-02-06 at 23:16:06: another lil case study: I wanted to show you the animation, not to just talk about it, but this required a multi-step task that was sort of "outside" of writing this thread:
- ship the code (took 20s; it was ready in test mode)
- screen capture
- make gif
- tweet

2023-02-06 at 23:16:06: all of this feels related to the Complice "Now Page" which is a page that shows you just your current intention (or some dropdowns/inputs for choosing an intention)

and to which I recently added an animation

2023-02-06 at 23:16:05: this tweet by @RomeoStevens76 has been a really useful set of simple instructions for getting into this mode of being for me

2023-02-06 at 23:16:05: most people are not very good at feeling the simple moment of satisfaction &amp; vast micro-rest when completing something (even a tiny fraction of some larger something)
https://t.co/tBFlN4Nbdm

2023-02-06 at 23:16:05: there's also something about the satisfaction of completing something in one day / arc

I suspect this is partially about open loops, like I wanted to finish it because I didn't want it to remain open and I didn't know how to close it without finishing it

2023-02-06 at 23:16:04: I suppose that part of what was lost was actually mental context‚Äîmy spreadsheet was tracking a bunch of stuff, but it wasn't remembering every place I'd looked or sorting decision I'd made

so finishing the task a later day risked some duplication of effort

2023-02-06 at 23:16:04: there's also something like arc momentum

I was recently organizing expenses for taxes, and each action locally took only 1 min and was very obvious in next steps

so I was locally quite interruptible

but when a short walk turned into a (lovely!) long walk, something was lost

2023-02-06 at 23:16:04: the other is when your mind is what's splayed out, eg:
- writing a long essay, paper or book, where all the parts are in the world but the WHOLE is in your head
- doing strategy, where you're considering lots of agents, causes, trajectories 
- this ofc:
https://t.co/cKjtUNxeVm

2023-02-06 at 23:16:03: there are maybe two different kinds of splayed-out-ness

one is when the splayed out stuff is in the world, eg
- you have your car taken apart
- a dozen books &amp; papers arranged on your desk
- a half-refactored codebase onto which other changes can't be made

2023-02-06 at 23:16:03: sometimes though we work in ways that have a lot of context sort of splayed out and it's a bit more delicate

@fortelabs wrote about state of mind as a key resource to knowledge work
https://t.co/GUbTrv8ioO

2023-02-06 at 23:16:03: but there's no disruption caused by getting a trashbag or going pee or something

those only risk disruption if while on such a mission I get waylaid into something deeper or longer

2023-02-06 at 23:16:02: like, simply by looking at the state of the thread, I can figure out what to do with it next

well, that's not totally true; if I waited long enough I might get out of touch with what I'm saying here and I'd at minimum need to re-read it in order for further words to flow

2023-02-06 at 23:16:02: just now, I was about to put something in the trash by my desk only to realize I hadn't put a new bag in

so I went mid-writing to go get a bag

the nature of this thread meant that (like the cleaning) I can leave the draft open and it affords finishing

2023-02-06 at 23:16:02: that friction is irrelevant to whatever it is we're aiming to do!

2023-02-06 at 23:16:02: there's a sense in which the easiest way to make the "unchecked checkboxes" error go away would be to delete the list or check them off without doing them

but we know that of course we can't just do that üòÇ

I suspect‚Ä¶ many of us have friction that is *literally* this conflict

2023-02-06 at 23:16:01: to-do lists introduce a level of indirection where it becomes easy to feel like the gap (aka "error") is "I have unchecked checkboxes" when this is kind of a meaningless proxy

even if you did a great job of enumerating the right things, the checkboxes don't contain matteringness

2023-02-06 at 23:16:01: there's a feeling when I am cleaning where my motivation is very simple

I simply:
- perceive the scene
- envision how I'd like it to be
- do whatever I feel like to close that gap

there's no to-do list, there's just a world and my desires

2023-02-06 at 23:16:01: there's a mode I can get in that is very beautiful and I want it in more of my life

where I'm present and taking care of something, such as cleaning a space, and in each moment I'm just doing whatever cares for it best, with full couldness at several scales

2023-02-06 at 23:11:31: @constructx @ScottDuncanWX idk how up to date is this (originally written 2015) but overall it's probably a good place to start:

2023-02-05 at 04:54:09: @finereli and land value tax also solves how to pay for UBI
(and creates the perfect wealth tax since you can't hide the fact that you own land and you can't store land off-shore, meanwhile incentivizing billionates to invest their money towards actually doing things not just rentseeking)

2023-02-05 at 04:52:56: @finereli makes even more sense with land value tax!

and land value tax seems to be in some sense deeply correct in terms of closing a particular loop

(currently the government will protect your right to continue owning land at WAY lower than the natural price for that service)

2023-02-03 at 22:09:57: @benholmen YES.

Also it is stupid that you have to destroy the information contained in the temperature setting, in order to turn off the shower.

Separate temperature and flow knobs! That solves a huge chunk of the problem without any clever engineering.

it's because it creates clarity that the answer to "am I going to exercise this morning?" is always "yes"

2023-02-02 at 00:44:26: is there something you'd like to try to do every day, but you having had the courage to commit, or you've tried to commit and you've already fallen off?

2023-02-02 at 00:44:26: we're a month into 2023

is the year going how you wanted? did you even take some time to envision what you might want?

are you in an environment that's challenging you to learn, but not too challenging?

2023-02-02 at 00:44:25: these lessons don't contradict each other‚Äîthey're both true, all the time

you can practice &amp; grow beyond your mistakes, and where that starts is accepting your current level so you can work to increase it

2023-02-02 at 00:44:25: the lesson of "accept your mistakes" is that you DID make the mistakes you made, and you have to start from there

tomorrow is a new day‚Äîyou can do something else, which could include repairing what broke yesterday, or might involve choosing to focus your energy on something new

2023-02-02 at 00:44:25: the lesson of the "make no mistakes" version is that with enough practice, you can perfect things (to some standard)

you can learn and grow and change and become the sort of person who doesn't make the mistakes you used to

2023-02-02 at 00:44:24: or is it more like he has to accept that he's going to do things that upset people or cause whatever problems, &amp; just do them anyway because that's his life, rather than regretting them and trying to change them?

doesn't matter‚Äîeither way, there's a lesson for real life there!

2023-02-01 at 06:17:23: @jessicafung_ 2. "reason" can also be like "do this because it's the right thing to do" which doesn't contain the actual fruit

2023-01-28 at 21:15:17: @jambarree you could do it queue-style or stack-style I guess

&gt; I now have the sense that the reason we were unable to successfully communicate was not due to lack of skill but due to being unwilling to face what would happen if communication were successful.

2023-01-28 at 08:05:03: 2022 was quite a year for me.

I have somehow attempted to condense it into a single stream of words. There are a lot of words. Writing it helped me make sense of things. Perhaps it will also illuminate something for you, about me or about life.

2023-01-22 at 00:15:31: there's also a version of this same no-longer-on-autopilot thing that happens regularly throughout adulthood, and that accessing it regularly is part of the point of some spiritual practices.

are people just referring to the first such version?

https://t.co/eZR6hR39WG

2023-01-22 at 00:15:31: in the comments on that video, some people are referring to the gained quality as sapience, sometimes translated as wisdom

maybe it's meta-sapience though? ie the reason our they thought of calling our species "homo sapiens sapiens"

2023-01-22 at 00:15:31: it seems clear this is about developmental stages in a general sense, and maybe different people are actually referring to different shifts? because one was more salient?

eg for one person it's about when they first decided that a memory was important; another theory of mind

2023-01-22 at 00:15:30: many people describe having a clear moment or even just an overall age when they WOKE UP into some sort of self-awareness &amp; became a person

the below is a dramatization, probably not typical. something re memory/continuity? self-other?

2023-01-22 at 00:13:09: people say that once kids are 7 or so, they have theory of mind

2023-01-22 at 00:01:39: ICYMI: this "change in location" test is used to measure Theory of Mind in kids.

2023-01-15 at 05:33:27: have you tried letting yourself not deal with the problem but keeping it in awareness until you remember why you want to, and then you want to?

I would like to summon a nerd to explain plz thx üôè

2023-01-15 at 05:16:52: so people don't get as sick, but they are still vectors for spreading this new variant of covid in particular, which other people are then more likely to catch in particular because they also don't have "shoot on sight" immunity still?

2023-01-15 at 05:16:51: therefore covid achieves immune escape, particularly from the "shoot on sight" by changing its name &amp; hair and dressing up in a new outfit

but once it starts to do its shenanigans, the body is much faster &amp; better to be like "we know your deal, die"

2023-01-15 at 05:16:51: like just trying to reason through... it seems like certain viruses (eg smallpox) get to like 100% immunity because they achieve the first thing in a way that the virus is incapable of mutating around

but covid is a sneaky bastard who mutates like fuck, so that doesn't work here

2023-01-15 at 05:16:51: (this line of inquiry based in part on that tweet but more from the gestalt of this whole latest @TheZvi covid article on XBB, which says "yep, it will spread more, no, P(doom|infected) has not increased")

https://t.co/eJrZ9E07yS

2023-01-15 at 05:16:50: it sounds like there are like... at least two different types of immune response?

"shoot on sight" - obliterates the the virus at low quantities before they can even grow

"I know your deal" - recognizes larger pattern once they've grown a bunch; mitigates damage

is this right? https://t.co/k1bC9o1xvt

I don't simply mean "have thoughts about", which could be done in a kind of mechanical or procedural way.

I mean something that involves kind of holding something in awareness and seeing what arises.

the same friend also realized that certain things (one was bright light, another might've been certain kinds of ambient noise) were causing tiredness, and since many social spaces have at least one of those... she thought it was the people tiring her!

both are about contextual improvisation rather than following scripts

2023-01-11 at 05:27:06: it's worth sending context even if the thing is *not* urgent, because otherwise I can't necessarily trust that you're not the sort of person who would send me an urgent thing without tagging it as such, so I sort of have to open it to find out

2023-01-11 at 05:27:06: if you can send a voice memo, you can also send a couple of words of context, since speech-to-text is widely available now so it's literally the same interface

2023-01-11 at 05:27:06: if you want to send a high-urgency voice message with zero context, there's another technology that's better for that

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉit's called a "phone call" üìûüìûüìû

then you get my reply immediately, or you find out I'm not available‚Äîimmediately! it's a win-win.

2023-01-11 at 05:27:05: I enjoy voice messages but I may go hours or days without an obvious time to listen to them, so if someone sends me one that's like "hey, there's a &lt;cool thing&gt; happening tonight, lmk if I should hold ur spot" with zero context.... üòíü§¨

instead, simply:
"party tonight! &lt;audio&gt;"

2023-01-11 at 05:27:05: voice messages are cool tech

most people send w zero context tho, which misses low-hanging fruit for using them responsibly:
- mention how time-sensitive
- share logistical details (times, addresses) outside
- giving at least 1 word of context (eg "idea", "Q", "funny story")

- this means that to reduce stress we need to create &amp; notice safety, not just get rid of threats
- being injured or fat or old makes people slower to react, so it's stressful
- as a kid, you get your sense of safety from seeing/hearing adults nearby feeling safe

- we used to think that animals only go *into* a threat response if they detect a threat (whether the threat is real or just a shadow)

2023-01-10 at 02:14:34: GUTS ELI5 1/3
- in order to stay alive, animals (including humans) need to react to threats

2023-01-10 at 01:26:03: @PeterXPark yeah, that also results in the group not aiming properly towards culture B but instead ending up pointed towards &lt;weighty person's concept of culture B&gt;, which  is ultimately a form of A reasserting itself

I talk about this failure mode in depth here:
https://t.co/qXw4qUtygF

2023-01-10 at 01:24:12: @PeterXPark whereas wokeism is currently attempting to perform a kind of rank flip, and then using what power it has to indignify people who have too much "privilege"

which is just recapitulating the same dynamics

2023-01-10 at 01:24:02: @visakanv "rank" here, to be clear, refers to social rank, which when rankism is present results in pecking order and self-reinforcing power structures

but relevant experience is something that needs to be tracked

and differences in wealth or strength are inevitable

2023-01-10 at 01:19:56: @PeterXPark I think Robert W. Fuller anticipated it well in his book where he points out that the actual issue is ever denying anybody dignity for any reason, and that the particular axes of abuses are important to track but inexhaustible.

2023-01-10 at 00:54:32: the below tweet is a quote originally from Howard Thurman btw

but I thought it would be fun to remix it as "ICYMI"

I'll invite you to pick a quote you love that's sufficiently well-known that others might've seen it... tweet it with just ICYMI (no attrib) then QT it below https://t.co/cX59IV4Tkg

what might you do now to make it hard to get into a flow state?

can you uhhh stop doing any of that?

2023-01-10 at 00:49:35: @AbstractFairy thread that talks about this phenomenon, including how the very nature of communication makes it hard to say anything original since you somehow need to say it within a frame that will work for the listener, and in that frame your idea makes no sense

2023-01-10 at 00:44:55: @micahtredding automating bill payments is one of the classics

2023-01-10 at 00:29:17: @alt_visa hate to break it to you but you have enough social capital that there are already probably dynamics like this around you

but money is worse because it's more fungible, eg nobody woulda begged qc to send them some of his mother's love if she hadn't given it to him in dollars

2023-01-10 at 00:26:29: oh lol I actually quoted it (or half of it) in the 2nd tweet in my thread. oh well, worth having for the paraphrase

https://t.co/ANYsfy71y8

2023-01-10 at 00:25:44: the original tweet I was QTing, since that account is now locked, said something like:

"everybody is fucking up in ways that are impossible for them to see but really obvious to everyone else"

2023-01-10 at 00:23:29: @visakanv being misunderstood

https://t.co/gUBJ86V9ER

2023-01-10 at 00:17:45: some examples of things you might do to open space for flow
- choose what to focus on next
- close out other stuff (tabs, phone stuff)
- say "ttyl" to people you're chatting with
- clear your mind by writing down things to attend to later

2023-01-10 at 00:17:44: imagine that some minutes from now you're in a flow state doing something worthwhile

what would need to happen to lay the groundwork for that? can you do that right now?

2023-01-10 at 00:14:55: @RomeoStevens76 huh, I don't really see it
but maybe I'm too indexed on failed versions of GTD
I know the deep wisdom of it is about single-tasking and avoiding having excess open loops
but in practice it seems to often break down into neurotically wrangling tasks rather than doing stuff

like I was about to nap a few minutes ago but then came on twitter instead, and have been in a slight space of tension about it even though I've had a few good exchanges

sticky stuff

2023-01-08 at 05:56:26: @MWStory partially it's straight up different people

some people are trapped in outrage spirals, some are plugged into the collective consciousness in a way that feels delightful and nourishing

2023-01-07 at 06:00:16: other common distinctions:
- relationship: friend vs enemy
- intent: constructive vs antagonistic (friends sometimes antagonize)

this new "understanding" distinction helps me explain what's going on for me when a friend thinks they're helping but it feels like criticism to me

2023-01-07 at 05:56:58: @kcorazo wow, epic

are you open to sharing some examples of what has emerged over the years?

2023-01-06 at 04:25:22: it's possible to get something useful out of criticism, it just requires being able to hold your own sense of your intent and the value so far, and to not lose it in the face of:
- suggestions irrelevant to your intent
- wanting to say "that's not what I meant"
- etc

2023-01-06 at 04:25:21: vaguely feels to me like the difference between being criticized and being critiqued is that critique starts from an understanding of the intent and value-so-far of the thing being critiqued, whereas criticism starts criticizing before it actually gets to that.

2023-01-06 at 02:29:44: @nibrasibn I'd begin with their motivation and work backwards. what are they excited to do and what's in their way?

if they don't even know what's out there, explore possibilities with them to see what piques interest

2023-01-06 at 01:52:02: @robbensinger @b_subercaseaux @Corey_Yanofsky @xlr8harder @reasonisfun I do kind of identify myself and others on the basis of how they do relevance realization, which seems to be a sort of unique personal fingerprint on an information-processing level

but it's necessarily inherently evolutionary, not algorithmic, and ofc embodied/enactive/e/e

2023-01-06 at 01:49:25: @robbensinger @b_subercaseaux @Corey_Yanofsky @xlr8harder @reasonisfun I also think that describing a person as an algorithm is really wrong, at least connotationally but ultimately probably denotationally as well

2023-01-06 at 01:32:38: @not_a_hot_girl @goblinodds but also twitter on your phone at all is a bit of an antipattern because it makes it easier to consume/scroll and harder to create/tweet

2023-01-06 at 00:34:42: @CurziRose @mesolude you can also have both at play at once

eg greenhouse gas emissions cause a positive feedback loop due to melting ice caps (this is bad)

but they also (hopefully) cause humans to be like "wait this is bad we should lower emissions" and do things in order to do so

2023-01-06 at 00:33:21: @CurziRose @mesolude yeah, they refer to the multiplier sign of the feedback loop +/‚àí

egs of positive feedback loops (+‚û°Ô∏è+, or ‚àí‚û°Ô∏è‚àí)

‚ÄÉpoor get poorer

egs of negative feedback loops (‚àí‚û°Ô∏è+, or ‚àí‚û°Ô∏è+)

2023-01-06 at 00:07:48: @oreghall @dvassallo oh there are lots that sort of hypothetically could exist, but in practice cannot actually be constructed because nobody has the power to get all the parts in the right place at once

tell me more about GOATA stuff

2023-01-05 at 23:50:28: @kcorazo hmmmmm well, one of the things that @TadHargrave points at in his Marketing For Hippies work is that you want the style of your marketing to reflect the ethos of the thing you're marketing

like they should share a philosophy/paradigm/stance towards the world

2023-01-05 at 23:46:34: @KaseyKlimes also @HiNaryan I have some sense you may want to be tracking what Kasey's up to in terms of bringing collaboration into orgs

2023-01-05 at 23:46:07: @KaseyKlimes nice! you might like How The Way We Talk Can Change the Way We Work by Robert Kegan, for some structures for crafting shared agreements and so on

(my work in general is in creating cultures that are more self-aware, so it dovetails with yours here)

2023-01-05 at 23:40:04: @DRMacIver there's a difference between offering help and someone literally saying "please let me know how I can make it up to you" or something like that

 (I can't find the example, it's buried in my DMs and I just tried )

2023-01-05 at 23:32:46: @HephaistosF exactly! I can see why it would be confusing to make that a prominent option, but it would be cool to have it available somewhere in the composer for power-users

and then ALL users would benefit from power-users being able to do that

2023-01-05 at 22:10:19: Have you intended a theme for 2023?

2023-01-05 at 22:03:30: @caelanhuntress 10√ó greater financial abundance via @CompliceGoals, a smol human under my care, and a book on my Non-Naive Trust Dance framework published

oh and some music released, some divergent viewpoints synthesized

(I'm just summarizing my list of goals from the complice app lol)

2023-01-05 at 22:00:56: @gas_bitch agh I imagine you feel really powerless &lt;3

2023-01-05 at 21:55:19: if someone helps you out, don't burden them by asking them to find a way for you to make it up to them (this has happened to me)

2023-01-05 at 21:52:20: @BenRatkaj some phone plans don't have voicemail. I think it's possible to not set your voicemail up... maybe it's possible to deactivate your voicemail. I'd say call your phone provider

2023-01-05 at 21:47:34: @CoolPineapple18 @Shenalyo Mmmm, great point. If I were to try to restate "simple vs complex goals" it might be something like "is the behavior already well-defined, or is it something that's open-ended?"

I was thinking about this "whether to talk about" thing myself when I tweeted

and you'd like to offer your own answer
but you don't want to put it in the first tweet, because you want the first tweet to just be the prompt
but you don't want to put it in a second tweet, because you don't want to make it a thread

2023-01-05 at 21:30:12: @fortelabs I loved your Throughput of Learning post, &amp; I'm curious both:
1. to what extent, 6y later, have you headed towards this hypothetical 50th post, vs some other direction?

2023-01-05 at 06:37:23: @PeterXPark what does your ideal sustainable schedule look like?

2023-01-05 at 01:26:02: I'm excited to do some version of this indefinitely, but ofc shit happens so I guess maybe the final piece of the plan:
ü§î if I ever let that 3rd day pass with no workout, I'll append to this thread with a reflection on what happened, and instantiate a new intention going forward

2023-01-05 at 01:26:01: this is a bit like the principle "don't miss two days in a row"

https://t.co/O5Vv7IlSUY

2023-01-05 at 01:26:01: if I were in a situation where I had a recurring weekly schedule I might prefer to pick which days in advance, like MWF or TThSa or something

....but I really really don't at this phase in my life, so the flexible version seems better

2023-01-05 at 01:26:00: 2-3 days is a satisfying cadence for me, because there's a sense in which on the 2 day I am like "today could be workout day... but doesn't have to be..." but then on day 3 it's like, "okay for real no excuses today"

gives both flexibility &amp; clarity

2023-01-05 at 01:26:00: context: after excellent success with working out regularly Oct 2021 - May 2022, and seeing real gains in my abilities and physique (super motivating), I fell off the wagon when I went travelling and it was hard to find gyms and I was sick or jetlagged a bunch

2023-01-05 at 01:25:59: new plan:
üìÜ work out every 2-3 days, without fail
üèãÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è gym with barbells if there's one convenient, otherwise bodyweight (I've found ways to load enough using pistol squats &amp; handstand pushups)
üßò‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è if I'm too sick/something to do a strength workout, do 20+ mins of yoga and log that

2023-01-05 at 00:26:34: @tomcritchlow We've had some major upgrades in our thinking since we first designed the workshop, so there are probably still some places in the exercises that use more of a forcing frame, which could be even more allowing

https://t.co/rkSCOPxHAw

2023-01-05 at 00:24:22: @tomcritchlow Yeah, the best way to think about goal-setting imo is about liberating your future self to pursue things wisely.

This "trust yourself" vibe is why for our goal workshops we don't focus on metrics/deadlines but on your ability to recognize what you want:
https://t.co/5bUIovT3rf

2023-01-05 at 00:22:41: @KaseyKlimes do you end up helping people process their trauma while doing this facilitation? üòÆ

could be cool to include juxtaposition: invite people to recall past experiences of frustrated collaboration, &amp; bring whatever generalizations from that in contact with the new experiences

2023-01-05 at 00:19:31: RT @tomcritchlow: So much of goal setting and future planning is just your today self trying to command and control your future self.

https://t.co/Is06ZuFBIP

2023-01-04 at 23:56:16: and if you want to come to the GCI workshop itself, to choose from your dreams &amp; craft them into goals, there are sessions this weekend (nearly sold out!) and more the following weekend

so you could hit the stoa session as prep for the main workshop!
https://t.co/jjml05rbYo

2023-01-04 at 23:56:16: I'm going to be doing a live event next week where we go through this exercise, on The Stoa

would love to see you there!
https://t.co/wDQjjoizDX

2023-01-04 at 23:56:15: it's a great place to start because it invites you to set goals beyond the horizon of your current concerns

ie you're not just clarifying the ends towards which you're already working
(tho that can also be worthwhile)

2023-01-04 at 23:56:15: for the Goal-Crafting Intensives, this Dream List exercise is one of the first ones we recommend everyone do

ideally before the workshop to have a chance to sleep on it, but we have a "no homework" policy so you can do it during as well

2023-01-04 at 23:56:14: each one I crossed off, at the first phase or after considering it a bit more, liberated a bit of energy.

great practice saying "no"‚Äîeven just internally

2023-01-04 at 23:56:14: it was also really clarifying to realize that despite having some amount of identity as an inventor, I didn't actually care that much about getting a patent.

(I also, hilariously, apparently thought at the time that having a patent might make me money)

2023-01-04 at 23:56:14: some that I crossed out at the time, I've since come back to!
"learn to backflip" (took 30min)
"make passive income" (took months)
"be completely self-employed" (took years)
"be featured on Hacker News" (happened kinda opportunistically)
"travel around the world" (last year!)

2023-01-04 at 23:56:12: the 1st time I did a dreaming exercise was 11 years ago, &amp; it was really mind-expanding. I considered a wide range of things, including some that would take decades &amp; lots of luck, and some that were physically impossible

it was exhilarating to think I could pursue any of them https://t.co/VzQzwrKUcX

2023-01-04 at 23:56:12: a dream is like a goal in almost every way, except you're not actually doing anything to move towards it

Dream = recognizable desired state in the future
https://t.co/5bUIovTBgN

2023-01-04 at 23:56:11: have you ever made a list of a bunch of ambitious potential-goals you might want to pursue?

if not, I highly recommend it

the process increases couldness on a vast scale

2023-01-04 at 23:52:09: @meekaale ooooh yeah. I'd love to see a tweet remixing Rosa &amp; GUTS

2023-01-04 at 23:51:44: @5matthewdub ahh interesting, yeah. are you seeing any particular implications when you hold these two side-by-side?

to me it seems like plausibly in some cases the trauma flows and then that actually disturbs the environmental safety, which then buries the trauma a layer deeper

2023-01-04 at 23:50:44: @jonnym1ller one thing they point out is that literally being stronger or in better physical health makes you less baseline stressed because you're more safe in general

ventral vagal capacity probably plays a similar role

2023-01-04 at 23:49:53: @meekaale also maybe suggests that in a eutopian city, apartment complexes would have like... friendly public-facing identities somehow? or they'd be little scenes, with meaningful interfaces available to strangers

2023-01-04 at 23:48:45: @meekaale yeah this part really struck me too

suggests perhaps that meeting one's neighbors may be more important than people think, insofar as every walk you take will start by walking past those houses

2023-01-04 at 23:32:49: Goal-Crafting Foundations: Dreaming Big

@peternlimberg invited me to come on The Stoa to share some of what we explore in our workshops, and I thought I'd invite people into ideating dreams they might want to turn into goals!

2023-01-04 at 04:01:47: new ü§Ø just dropped: Generalized Unsafety Theory of Stress

2023-01-04 at 03:53:58: @cube_flipper yeah! a bunch of us have been working on a more contagious form of nonduality, like basically entire cultures that support moving towards liminality &amp; synchrony, that don't collapse on contact with dualism

These are among my favorite experiences of customer support

2023-01-03 at 11:53:49: @visakanv also we are constantly co-creating our norms, and some norms are loose and can be changed by someone proposing something different even once

eg I recently set off an abundance vibes chain of 4 "I'll pay for dinner today"s (vs settling up via venmo)

https://t.co/CSQuGmjfP0

2023-01-03 at 11:51:12: @visakanv also, different spaces have different meta-norms, ie ways of relating to norms and the maintenance of norms

broadly these include

2023-01-03 at 11:32:35: @TylerAlterman I have sometimes felt like the solution might be to introduce some of these friends to each other, so you can hang out with each of them vicariously through each other. I've rarely managed this, but it might work for some of the more remote people.

2023-01-02 at 13:58:02: @CurziRose good articulation of a particular downward spiral!

(fwiw, this is technically still positive (ie reinforcing) feedback loop, just in a negative (ie shitty) direction... "negative feedback loops" refer, confusingly, to moving towards something, because it's closing a gap)

2023-01-02 at 13:49:00: @diviacaroline huh this seems related to a story I heard about someone (Gregory Bateson?) training a dolphin to invent new tricks, which is ofc hard to reward for... and supposedly they had to do a lot of reinforcing/encouraging the dolphin for just participating, but eventually it worked

2023-01-02 at 13:43:14: @__drewface @strangestloop it's partially more reply game and partially more like... working with the garage door up. like what are you currently working on with TN NYC? tweet about it. think out loud. joke about some kind of help that you could use even if you don't NEED it (yet)

2023-01-02 at 13:39:46: @__drewface @ricvolpe @interintellect_ they have a browser extension that puts someone's collaboration possibilities onto their twitter profile! exactly the thing we're looking for

https://t.co/0NTeIkIdZE

2023-01-02 at 13:25:27: haven't finished this article yet but it's so far a great intro to Ren√© Girard and suggests some interesting implications about role models, double-binds, conflict, blame.

2023-01-02 at 13:12:50: @commandodev for cardio...
my first thought was sex

but probably more helpfully, dancing (great way to explore what movements feel good, while getting energy up enough to work the heart)

start alone at home for calibration, but you could maybe go out to ecstatic dance

2023-01-02 at 13:10:01: @natural_hazard I just get really overtly excited about books until other people pick them up. often I've (near) finished the book before they start, but not always

no need to be perfectly sync'd as long as it feels fresh so you can both excitedly nerd out

(chatgpt claims they have, but I can't find any papers on it)

2023-01-02 at 12:33:16: huh, I had "mirror neurons" tagged as debunked awhile ago or something but a quick google yields that they seem to have some legitimacy

the gist (I'd sorta forgotten tbh) is that certain neurons fire both when doing a particular thing X or when watching someone else do X

2023-01-01 at 12:14:11: @utotranslucence start by affirming the sensibility of your own perspective, to yourself

I did this today once I realized I was being defensive. when I did, I noticed things came up to say, but I held my tongue and just kept hearing myself thoroughly until I felt curious (took a few minutes)

2023-01-01 at 12:13:35: @utotranslucence oh and also, if someone seems to be thoroughly heard but they're not getting proactively curious about your perspective, you can just try saying "I'd like to share my own perspective, if/when you're ready"! and see what happens

2023-01-01 at 12:11:32: @utotranslucence whether it's helpful to indicate while listening that you have a different perspective probably depends on both parties

it could be a distraction or get in the way of the person really feeling affirmed - has a kind of "yes but" quality

or could help them feel you're not hiding

2023-01-01 at 12:09:31: @utotranslucence that's probably true and even there it might take some nudging.

one variation on step 2 involves listening to &amp; affirming their perspective while still being clear it's *their* perspective and that you're seeing things differently

2023-01-01 at 12:05:03: @utotranslucence instead, what's needed, afaict, is something like this process üëá

https://t.co/UfbQAENTGU

2023-01-01 at 12:03:34: @utotranslucence in a funny way, peoples' defensiveness against explanations that are missing the sensibleness of their actions... are SO close to being glorious gospel of wisdom

but since they tend to counter-blame (ie deny *others* perspectives/sensibility), they fail
https://t.co/D25SrWcocU

2023-01-01 at 12:00:28: @utotranslucence the empowerment ofc is in some potential future similar situation. the past is as it is and in some sense truly couldn't have gone any differently

and is only real when it is in contact with the one to whom this time actually made sense

= juxtaposition, in the coherence sense

2023-01-01 at 11:45:43: @utotranslucence which is profoundly different from what you're talking about: an empowering explanation that highlights a degree of freedom they hadn't noticed while also respecting that they genuinely didn't notice it or that they had some other consideration that made it seem unworkable

2023-01-01 at 11:43:32: @utotranslucence actually, wait. those are the same thing.

blame, as I understand it, is a type of explanation that doesn't incorporate the sense that what someone did made, and says they should have done something different,

2023-01-01 at 11:36:16: @utotranslucence part of why people reject explanations is because they don't want to be blamed

but also part of why they reject explanations is that the explanations don't incorporate all of the subtle sensibleness of everything they DID do

and it must have made sense:
https://t.co/tsFoTLdehs

2023-01-01 at 11:34:42: @utotranslucence thus what keeps the blame game going is largely the failure to devise such a both/and explanation

which afaict is partially just a lack of practice at doing so, but also blocked by an assumption or fear that it doesn't exist &amp; thus in self-preservation one must fight to not lose

2023-01-01 at 11:30:53: @utotranslucence the blame game is essentially a game of fighting over explanations, one where where one person could &amp; should have prevented, the other where the other.

in most situations, BOTH can be empowered by an explanation that simultaneously highlights moves available from each position

2023-01-01 at 11:28:40: @utotranslucence thus if someone seems to be refusing to take responsibility, a good strategy is to come up with explanations that both empower them with a move they could make and ALSO are acceptable to them on other levels

2023-01-01 at 11:26:39: @davidmanheim @MatjazLeonardis Yeah I remember a twitter convo about cultures &amp; drugs but I'm not aware of a book. Feels like something @eigenrobot might remember or have been involved in.

2023-01-01 at 11:25:49: @utotranslucence yesss‚Äîwith one small change: "an explanation", not "the explanation"

multiple explanations are always possible
and often the only one someone has available in which they could have prevented, is one that implies they're an idiot or something else they rightly refuse to accept

https://t.co/uDCjmn8ULd

2022-12-29 at 03:47:54: the observation in the first tweet above seemed sort of absurdly obvious, but eg wikipedia doesn't make this distinction. it just says:

&gt; A stepfather or stepdad is a non-biological male parent married to one's preexisting parent.

2022-12-29 at 03:47:53: incidentally, in my family, we have different names for each grandparent, chosen from things like "grandad", "grandpa", "pop", "opa"

and mom's partner will have such a name as well. as, most likely, will my dad's partner, tho they're not married &amp; she might just go by her name

2022-12-29 at 03:47:52: like the meaning of "step-" is functionally something like "instead of"

(etymologically it seems like "step-" relates specifically to the *loss* of the original parent‚Äîinitially in the context of orphanhood... which again, doesn't apply to grandkids in this situation!) https://t.co/mvbzsVjnXn

2022-12-29 at 03:47:52: tbh, the sense in which he'll be "step" seems minimal. sure, he's not their bio gdad, but since there's nobody else who's ever been in the "grandmother's husband" role from the gkids view, he's no less a real gdad than any dad to an adoptive or surrogate kid is ü§î

2022-12-29 at 03:47:51: and yet, when I have kids, he *will* be a (step-)grandfather to them! because my kids will always have known him in that role.

interestingly, since he doesn't have kids of his own, this will kind of make him a grandfather without him ever having been a father!

2022-12-29 at 03:47:51: noticing that "stepdad" &amp; "stepmom" seem to refer specifically to someone your parent married while you were still a kid &amp; living with them. it's a role.

my parents split when I was ~25 and eg mom's new guy is just "mom's partner". wouldn't *occur* to me to call him "stepdad"

2022-12-26 at 03:51:14: 8. difference ‚Üê‚Üí the duality that the one everything is entirely composed of.

change is difference with an arrow. we perceive the world via differences in incoming photons &amp; pressure, and electrical neural diffs.

"information is a difference that makes a difference" ‚Äî Bateson

2022-12-26 at 03:42:22: 7. distinct ‚Üê‚Üí different in some way that is relevant/significant. I've found myself saying "these are distinctly different". Everything is different! But who cares?

The difference is already there, and by default everything is con-fused, but we can *make* a distinction.

2022-12-26 at 03:37:54: 6. perspective ‚Üê‚Üí a subjective experience of reality, as distinct from others. the distinction can be from: 
- one's position in time and space
- different sense organs (eg a dog &amp; human always have different perspectives)
- different context / life experience / meaning-making

2022-12-26 at 03:35:15: feel free to suggest words to me, and I'll include them if they feel relevant to me and fit within the thread!

2022-12-26 at 03:27:09: 5. dialogue ‚Üê‚Üí aiming to make new meaning together out of what each perspective is holding. requires me to simultaneously hold what I know and open to what the other knows. neither dominating nor submitting my frame will achieve this

https://t.co/V1ZZexU3x1

2022-12-26 at 03:27:09: 4. commensurable ‚Üê‚Üí literally "able to be measured together", I recently picked this word up from wikipedia, where it talks about paradigm shifts as involving incommensurability problems

cf frame conflict, where bootstrapping dialogue gets tough
https://t.co/ha0LSWSBkB

2022-12-26 at 03:27:09: 3. sense ‚Üê‚Üí subjective order

"that makes sense" reflects a relation with [that] of being able to make [that] commensurable with the rest of experience.

the "senses" or "sense fields" [including mind] are that which turns the ever-unfolding-everything into something sensible

2022-12-26 at 03:27:08: 2. entropic gradient ‚Üê‚Üí each cognitive system has a sense of where it's going, at any scale/complexity, whether:
- a zygote sensing how to grow
- a lizard sensing where to nap
- a human learning how to love
- a company doing biz strategy

entropic gradient ~= that direction

2022-12-26 at 03:27:08: 1. relevant ‚Üê‚Üí somehow connects with what's at hand, in a manner that follows the entropic gradient of one's meaning-making, ie in a way that matters

2022-12-26 at 00:41:07: @sympatheticopp Oh yeah, you want to accept your shame... are people suggesting you shouldn't? Actually yeah that probably is a common pendulum swing among people learning how not to be ruled by shame.

2022-12-26 at 00:39:45: @sympatheticopp So genuine remorse, a feeling of "oh man, I hurt someone" is a powerful useful feeling. It's like grief plus a deep need to learn how to be better in future.

By contrast, shame as a tool for social control has various issues, among them that it can't aim
https://t.co/JPt78ZVeAb

your tweet prompted me to finally write up a thread about them, so thanks!
https://t.co/nSRES9I1n6

2022-12-23 at 02:49:43: If you're intrigued but kinda suspicious of goals altogether, I might recommend this thread:

(in it, I address all the concerns I'm aware of, so hit me with any that it doesn't satisfy!)
https://t.co/mdaL5P9dcd

2022-12-23 at 02:49:43: If you want to apply these principles to your own life, come to a GCI workshop in January where you have a few hours to pick some goals, clarify them like this, plan, &amp; much more!

And you get help from me &amp; other coaches the whole time.
https://t.co/GbbX1GEwjQ

2022-12-23 at 02:49:42: So, that's the CSI Approach!

You want your goals to be:
üò§ Challenging (won't happen by default)
üéØ Specific (you can recognize when you've arrived)
üë£ Immediate (next steps now)
üòç Approach-oriented (towards, not away)

2022-12-23 at 02:49:42: üòç Approach goals: caveats

Hard to caveat this one, it's so key. But maybe I'll note that by clarifying what you're moving *towards*, that might activate different kinds of resistance or identity-grasping. So listen closely and see if you can incorporate those concerns.

2022-12-23 at 02:49:41: üòç Approach goals: how?

In order to not do something, you need to be doing something else. In order for something to not be true about you, something else must be true. What's that thing?

One person's "lose weight" becomes "bikini body", another's "cardio health"

2022-12-23 at 02:49:41: üòç Approach goals: why?

Awayness can't aim. You have to go *somewhere*. even if you're running from a lion, you could reframe that as running *to* safety.

I've got a whole article about this here:
https://t.co/JPt78ZUGKD

2022-12-23 at 02:49:40: üë£ Immediate goals: caveats

If you dive right into doing stuff, it might end up being entirely unstrategic. There's a tradeoff between doing stuff (which gets you more info) &amp; figuring out the right thing to do. No right answers‚Äîdo what seems best. But do something, today.

2022-12-23 at 02:49:39: üë£ Immediate goals: how?

If it's not obvious where to start, you might pick a small project you can complete and learn from.

I wrote out a bunch of examples in this thread:
https://t.co/XqU0JfiU7l

2022-12-23 at 02:49:39: üë£ Immediate goals: why?

In your map of the world, that has the goal as a destination, you need a "you are here" sign. You need to be *on that map*, and know where you are. You need to exist in continuous relation to the destination‚Äîthe mountain on the horizon isn't a postcard.

2022-12-23 at 02:49:38: üéØ Specific goals: caveats

Quantification can be good, though it can also lead to goodharting: focusing on the measurement at the expense of why it matters

But sometimes what you want is open-ended exploration. And that's okay! But it can still help to have bite-sized projects

2022-12-23 at 02:49:37: üéØ Specific goals: how?

If possible, describe the goal such that someone who is watching you would be able to easily tell if you had achieved it or not.

For something inner/subjective, it could be a statement about the world that you couldn't honestly say now but would like to.

2022-12-23 at 02:49:37: üéØ Specific goals: why?

Having clear details helps you figure out what to prioritize and what to cut when it's crunch time. It also helps with motivation to have a vivid image of the destination.

2022-12-23 at 02:49:36: üò§ Challenging goals: caveats

You probably have multiple goals, &amp; there's a level of challenge that would be totally doable on *one* of your goals but utterly overwhelming or even paralyzing if you tried that much challenge on 5 goals at once. All goals share your 168hours/week.

2022-12-23 at 02:49:36: üò§ Challenging goals: how?

Look for the "challenge accepted" level of difficulty. The level where if you succeeded, you'd be like "wow, now I know I can do that kind of thing! I changed in the process"

2022-12-23 at 02:49:35: üò§ Challenging goals: why?

Aiming for something that won't happen by default means this really is a goal that needs your conscious strategic attention. And the challenge motivates you to grow and become someone new.

2022-12-23 at 02:49:34: I got CSI Approach from Nick Winter's The Motivation Hacker; iirc he cites Piers Steel but I've seen almost no other references to it online or explanations, so we kinda reverse-engineered how &amp; why each element is key, for our workbook.

üò§ Challenging (won't happen by default)

It's pay-what-you-want, so easy to show up without already being sold on it! Would love to see more twitter people there at tomorrow's session:
https://t.co/wmfiRD8tnD

2022-12-18 at 01:54:56: It's called the Goal-Crafting Intensive and it's an online workshop which is a hybrid self-paced &amp; cohort-based course (we call it self-based üòé) where you show up at a particular time but then you go through the material however you want, supported live by me &amp; other coaches.

2022-12-18 at 01:54:55: Want to talk with me about your goals &amp; plans for 2023?

I've got a lot going on, but I've figured out a way to scale my attention, involving a mix of:
- videos &amp; exercises
- coworking container
- a method for having dozens of slack convos in parallel (along with other coaches)

2022-12-16 at 00:45:19: And honestly inner conflict has turned out to be one of the main things we look at at our Goal-Crafting Intensive workshops.

The workshop content still starts with clarifying goals though, because otherwise there's nothing even worth being conflicted about!

2022-12-16 at 00:45:19: Fuck that sounds cheesy. It's true though. And part of what my freedom/consequences tweet is pointing at is the importance of embracing ALL aspects of the future you're envisioning.

Otherwise despite "choosing" the goal, the conflict will cause resistance.

2022-12-16 at 00:45:19: I love helping people think through this stuff, because it's been so meaningful &amp; satisfying for me to set aside standard life scripts and do what I want because it's what I want. And I love living with the consequences.

https://t.co/eNA1KLUoIm

2022-12-16 at 00:45:18: Don't worry: you don't need to make all of those changes all at once. They'll happen on the journey, as you keep the goal in mind and take each next step towards it in the present.

I knew how to code when I started Complice, but not much more!
https://t.co/bWBSo9c8yx

2022-12-16 at 00:45:18: It's all a series of steps, but it's also learning.

YOU are going to change and evolve. You'll develop new skills, and find ways to get help where you fall short.

2022-12-16 at 00:45:18: It's all one step, then another.

At most points in a project you have LOTS of potential next steps and in fact the challenge becomes picking which.

This is where again, you keep the goal in mind as you consider each step. Which step fits the path best?

2022-12-16 at 00:45:17: Generators for next actions:
‚ÄÉü§î list out decision options &amp; criteria
‚ÄÉüî¨ set up better measurements / feedback loops
‚ÄÉüåÑ new daily habit until better one found
‚ÄÉ‚òéÔ∏è call a friend to ask for advice
‚ÄÉüìñ buy (or finally open) relevant book
‚ÄÉüë©‚Äçüíª mkdir newproj; cd newproj; git init

2022-12-16 at 00:45:17: Part of how you can tell you've set a new goal, on any timescale, is you have a clear sense of some new things that you're going to do.

Some good examples from my life:
‚ÄÉüíø record an album ‚Üí list out potential songs
‚ÄÉüìà grow Complice ‚Üí fix site analytics

2022-12-16 at 00:45:16: You don't need to do the most important thing, either. Just find something that isn't obviously NOT the most important thing, and do that. Then do another.

https://t.co/x52m2U8QFx

2022-12-16 at 00:45:16: Don't get stuck here, but if the next step isn't clear, the next step is "find a plausible next step"

Brainstorm ideas. Try stuff. Read a book. Talk to someone who did something similar. Sit and do nothing until a move arises.
https://t.co/PK2MTtzfwf

2022-12-16 at 00:45:16: And you may not know what you need to do‚Äîin fact, you almost certainly don't!

But you can at least start down some new paths...
https://t.co/9A8y3QCqXY

2022-12-16 at 00:45:15: But somehow, if you consider some different world, and it's clear you want to move towards it (maybe you don't!) then it'll suddenly lay bare:

‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉ‚ÄÉyou gotta do new stuff to get there

2022-12-16 at 00:45:15: Imagine finally getting your side-hustle started and profitable. That's probably not going to happen if you keep doing what you're currently doing.

2022-12-16 at 00:45:15: When you choose &amp; clarify a new goal, the vividness of that desired future draws you into it, today

2022-12-14 at 21:00:10: @ReneeSolana I expected the "how" to be in the charts; from this I come up with:

how = feel the adjacent feeling in the direction you want to move

so if you're feeling hatred, you can't go straight to contentment, but you can go to jealousy, then to anger, etc

prolly false tho lol

2022-12-13 at 19:32:47: but uhhh don't assess an expert by watching them talk with a journalist or critic

watch them talk with someone else who's curious, or something

2022-12-13 at 19:32:46: a caveat that sometimes the person arguing for a thing is arguing because they're afraid of losing face, not because they're uncurious in general

they're arguing with someone who has failed to pass whatever threshold needed for them to feel open to engagement

2022-12-13 at 19:32:46: which means: as always with trust stuff, the thing to refine is your capacity to listen to your own sense of distrust

the quiet voice that says "something's off here"

if you can sense someone's intent‚Äîargue vs learn‚Äîthat goes a LONG way, and you might not need specific cues

2022-12-13 at 19:32:45: once we're talking about society-level training though, then if we train people to look for the sorts of signals I mention above, people will learn to fake them

but at least some of these are hard to fake *well*

2022-12-13 at 19:32:45: you can learn to recognize signs of motivated reasoning etc

signs of defensiveness vs curiosity, when presented with something that might contradict their model

whether they trust themselves to figure things out or are actually deferring to someone else's orthodoxy

2022-12-13 at 19:32:45: you can spot whether their confidence confabulates answers about everything, or whether they're aware of the limitations of their knowledge

whether they can take in new questions and go "huh, lemme think" or whether they pattern-match everything to known Qs &amp; give cached answers

2022-12-13 at 19:32:44: as an individual, or in training kids or helping friends develop it...

my sense is there are certain cues you can pay attention to in how someone is thinking, that can help you tell if eg they've considered alternate explanations for what they're observing

2022-12-13 at 19:32:44: the skill of fairly reliably assessing expertise in someone, without having expertise in the subject yourself

feels like a very important thing to develop for oneself, one's kids, and hopefully for every member of society https://t.co/PorM0F2y5L

objective laws of physics also describe a dynamic world

and I think a lot of them end up specifying "this won't work"

but you can't "just do the thing" unless you're already just doing the thing

unless the only obstacle is that you THINK you need to do something else, in which case "just X" is saying "you don't need to do other things" which if it lands works great

2022-12-13 at 03:06:55: seems a bunch of self-coercion involves a game of chicken where each side dials up some sort of pain until one side relents

the pain could even just be the intrinsic pain of inner conflict

2022-12-13 at 02:32:16: which is more your edge right now?

2022-12-13 at 02:04:13: PS: you are god‚Äîgod's goodness is enacted (in part) by you, however it makes sense to you to enact it

love and do as thou wilt

https://t.co/A7T4rPOAvZ

2022-12-13 at 02:04:13: these are not in conflict
they may seem in conflict from a single person's narrow viewpoint

but if you think god isn't omnipotent or omnibenevolent because god SHOULD do something god's not doing? uhhh. why do you think you know better?

2022-12-13 at 02:04:12: god is the whole universe
the whole universe knows what it's up to
the whole universe wills goodness (as far as I can tell, and many have corroborated)
the whole universe has the power to do whatever it in fact will do

2022-12-13 at 02:04:11: the fact that we can imagine god reaching a giant hand down to do something to prevent evil doesn't make that make sense

2022-12-13 at 02:04:10: ...I really like the "you fool. you absolute moron." phrase for some reason but I want to be clear it's the memes here that are moronic not the people holding them

like everything, they make sense from the inside!

2022-12-13 at 02:04:10: no more than god can have already sprooged eleventy colorless green ideas that are sleeping furiously

this is highlighted by the classic "can god create a rock so heavy he can't lift it?"

you fool. you absolute moron. your concept of god is irrelevant

2022-12-13 at 02:04:09: can god use his dashboard to select the leftmost half of the universe and delete it? of course the fuck not that makes no fucking sense
https://t.co/t5wTCkjJzl

2022-12-13 at 02:04:09: thinking of the classic trilemma of how there can be evil if god can be omniscient, omnipresent, and omnipotent

my take: essentially what we imagine "omnipotent" to be includes arbitrary intervention, but such actions are illusory &amp; so the idea god can take them meaningless

2022-12-13 at 01:35:40: "just" is sus

you can't "just" do something
there are reasons you're not already doing it
you need to find a way to do some version of the something while also satisfying those reasons
and if you're not doing it yet, that means you haven't found it

2022-12-11 at 21:24:43: there is an objective truth to morality but it is not outside us

it is a truth about what we want, collectively

2022-12-11 at 20:57:58: @aleksil79 seems tautological enough for me!

2022-12-11 at 20:57:10: @bobz44 @visakanv @Nsousanis if it's not, it's probably not actually integrated, just one side masquerading as an integrated position

2022-12-11 at 20:54:32: @ScottCl03147460 @tetranomos I think you meant to flip the roles in half the story, but I get the point

I don't see how it connects up with what @tetranomos said tho

that's how chess centaurs work

https://t.co/zzFo8qLXBq

2022-12-11 at 20:50:35: @AskYatharth but I think it's not just because role flip. it's:
- I trust/like your thinking
- your thread will get lil attn if bad
- blog post itself short, easy to link (vs if someone tries to write a canonical book summary and people don't like it, those people will dismiss the book)

2022-12-11 at 20:48:41: @AskYatharth interestingly I don't actually have this concern about you rewriting my post instead of linking to it

2022-12-11 at 20:37:16: @anielsen108 mmm, or "the best for us" which is maybe straightforwardly accurate with a coherent traditional culture but is absurd in our atomized chaotic cultural landscape now, even on a local scale

2022-12-11 at 20:35:52: @ultimape @visakanv yes, that's also a fun way to do it

and honestly part of the nice thing about "wrong answers only" is it encourages people to reply with SOMETHING because there's zero pressure to say anything correct or useful

creates a space of play, undoes the teacher vibe associated w Qs ü§Ø

2022-12-11 at 20:34:54: what's great about the "wrong answers only" format?

wrong answers only

2022-12-11 at 20:34:12: @AskYatharth yeah, nice! that's fucking great. reminds me of another ~tautology of mine that I haven't tweeted, hang on...

(you don't actually have to hang on since I'm gonna tweet it before I tweet this tweet)

...boom:
https://t.co/eYDwzYi7dD

2022-12-11 at 20:34:06: &amp; anything like that is part of what I need to deal with in order to get understood

I don't need to myself see it how they do, but I need to acknowledge that (at present) they do, and that whatever new understanding they end up with will need to incorporate all of their knowings

2022-12-11 at 20:34:05: or it might be that in fact they do understand what I mean in a local sense, but given other experiences and understandings they have, accepting what I'm saying would imply other things to them (but not to me) that they don't want to accept

2022-12-11 at 20:34:05: now, it *might* be that they got distracted or triggered by a particular word I used, and that if I try to explain again later using different language, then they'll be able to readily hear what I'm trying to say

2022-12-11 at 20:34:05: what I've said above is technically a tautology, although I could imagine people not seeing that &amp; rejecting it or what they think it implies

which, interestingly, is an example of the phenomenon itself!

2022-12-11 at 20:34:05: if I try to tell someone something, and they respond with an objection that's entirely irrelevant to what I meant

what they respond with is entirely relevant to what THEY thought I meant*, and that's what I need to dialogue with

*otherwise they would have said something else

2022-12-11 at 20:24:08: @ElodesNL yeah I was delighted when I found it

2022-12-11 at 20:19:30: @rachelclif hmm I neither understand this nor see how it's a tautology

but it's intriguing and I would like to understand it

what is congruence? what's the context of this utterance?

2022-12-11 at 20:18:34: @rachelclif that is what I would say in a new such instance now, but in this situation it was part of a much longer message to someone whose RTF files I'd opened before (including this most recent one that I'd had a frustrating experience with that I wanted to convey)

where did we get the idea that there is an objective "ought" in the first place?

my first guess is that it emerged in the red‚Üíblue (spiral dynamics) transition as a cheaper way to maintain power: justifying, rather than pure threatening

it would have to happen ambiently via phone geofencing or something like that

2022-12-11 at 01:38:30: phrased another, more symmetric way, to emphasize the consensuality of this

my current neighbors also like loud music, so they'd probably be into this

2022-12-11 at 01:36:44: I would pay a lot of money to have an app that told me when my downstairs neighbors were out so that I could blast music loudly at those times.

I LOVE the experience of working with loud music, AND I don't want to cause other people annoyance, and this is an information problem!

2022-12-10 at 22:41:40: @fyrescotch @Arimil_ @Shannon_Breezy1 @elonmusk it looks like some people are parsing this as:

2022-12-10 at 10:47:09: @RichDecibels @heyorson yeah one of the magical things about this game is that when the idea of it even being *possible* to do things wrong dissolves, you realize that the results of your mistakes &amp; confusions contain the very wisdom you were missing: learning

2022-12-10 at 10:41:06: @bobz44 @strangestloop @RichDecibels but let me take my own advice and explore your view here a bit... what feels in contradiction with materialism here? I'm not quite seeing the thing you're pointing at, even though it sorta feels familiar to me-from-some-years-ago

2022-12-10 at 10:39:55: @bobz44 @strangestloop @RichDecibels if you've found full 100% agreement with anyone (let alone everyone) regarding the entire universe you're either fooling yourself or you're god and you have a lot of work to do

there are always more things to understand together!

2022-12-10 at 10:37:34: @RichDecibels yeah! as I wrote in that post:

2022-12-10 at 10:34:13: @heyorson @RichDecibels if you instead can consider that even if he's not seeing what you're seeing, he's seeing *something* and attempting to describe it, then if it doesn't look that way to you, you can assume you're not looking at exactly what he's looking at / from the same angle

hence Rich's 180¬∞

2022-12-10 at 10:30:22: @heyorson @RichDecibels looking at what you wrote, I can appreciate that you were engaging in a collaborative (not adversarial) stance towards trying to understand *reality*, but you weren't trying to understand *what he was seeing*

you mapped his words onto what you were looking at and they seemed off

2022-12-10 at 08:44:40: @RichDecibels the writing explicitly said "Malcolm Ocean will be at the event as a fellow participant"

It made really salient (&amp; easier to let go) any urges to teach or be an authority during the event‚Äîeven kinds of authority I often adopt in situations that look *nothing* like me hosting!

2022-12-10 at 08:40:53: @RichDecibels I had a really trippy experience in October when I instantiated an event that was "hosted" by a piece of writing I'd done (the below letter + a framing piece saying that at this particular place/time people could converge to explore it)

at any rate, "work for anyone" is thus apparently false at this point! the rtf standard hasn't been updated since 2008 and gdocs doesn't support importing it at all

2022-12-06 at 06:54:21: it continues to be offensive to me that when I go to save a song I like in youtube, it defaults to putting it in the same playlist as the last playlist I used for a video I *uploaded*

using the same playlists for both is so WEIRD

2022-12-06 at 06:08:55: what's a thing you've said yes to (or might say yes to) that feels more like a burden than an excitement (even if it's somewhat exciting)

can you let it go? can you practice saying "no"?

if you're trying to think of something &amp; not coming up with anything... practice with this!

2022-12-06 at 05:00:55: I also left a comment here reflecting on how while I didn't get the obligation bug I did get a bunch of panic, which is a different kind of awayness-based collapsed-awareness motivation.
https://t.co/wMVKexFp0x

2022-12-06 at 05:00:55: &gt; It made me angry. I felt like I‚Äôd drunk the kool-aid of some pervasive cult, one that had twisted a beautiful human desire into an internal coercion, like one for a child you‚Äôre trying to get to do chores while you‚Äôre away from home.

2022-12-06 at 05:00:54: &gt; The thing underlying my moral ‚Äúobligation‚Äù came from me, my own mind. This underlying thing was actually a type of desire. It turned out that I *wanted* to help suffering people. I *wanted* to be in service of a beautiful world. Hm.

2022-12-06 at 05:00:54: finally got around to reading @TylerAlterman's powerful &amp; beautiful EA critique

it lays out very clearly how obligations are a coercive confusion that distracts us from our *desire* to help

2022-12-04 at 22:11:20: let us thank annoying wrong people, for giving us (memetic) evolution https://t.co/F77ABvjJMa

2022-12-04 at 22:10:50: this is, I think, btw, why it's so easy to write something up when someone else has just written up a wrong version

you cease trying to write the perfect canonical version, and instead seek to write something that's at least better than their shit version
https://t.co/F77ABvjJMa

2022-12-04 at 22:07:25: but then maybe that's a sign that that's a bad title! and "an initial PCT lens on coercion" would be better for the first one and "coercion and collapsed awareness" would be better for the second one!

"what is coercion" sets the post up to BE canonical! maybe that's a mistake!

2022-12-04 at 22:07:25: although also like, when I started trying to edit this into a post, it changed so much that it isn't even necessarily accurate to call the new version I might publish "v2" of the same thing, except insofar as both might be titled "what is coercion?"

https://t.co/MxMdZoPp6J

2022-12-04 at 22:07:24: anyway, it seems to me that writing posts INTENDED to be canon is really hard because it sets up a whole perfectionistic vibe, and that having an iterative approach is better and maybe I want my posts to be almost like... numbered as v0.9, v1, v1.1?

2022-12-04 at 22:07:24: hmmm... many meanings!

https://t.co/Y3lITqJlwo

2022-12-04 at 22:07:24: the @LessWrong books are a great example of how to approach this: they don't even start trying to pick the "best of 2019" until 2021. a whole year must pass‚Äîwhat do people keep going back to?

https://t.co/R2rKriERDd

2022-12-04 at 22:07:23: likewise, what forms contemporary canon for a given group of people doesn't per se know that it's going to be canon when it's written

of course, some blog posts know they're NOT going to be canon, but the question of what IS canon is subject to the sands of time

2022-12-04 at 22:07:23: even in the original sense of canon as excellent or supreme books, which began as an extension from the  authoritarian canon of the bible...

...those books weren't written AS canon. they BECAME canon when they were selected https://t.co/kgZOhGuoRR

2022-12-04 at 22:07:22: canon is emergent

2022-12-04 at 22:06:56: meanings of "canon":
1. what is the first answer I give to how to answer this question or where to start on this topic?
2. what's everything on this topic I'd consider to be worth reading / not confused
3. what posts can a given group all assume each other has read?

2022-12-04 at 21:30:10: we are still just barely understanding the nature of the mediums we are participating in

and I think that's beautiful
https://t.co/mYCCECAofW

2022-12-04 at 21:30:10: what even is a tweet?
what is an utterance?
what is a thread?
what is a post?
what is a book?
what is an essay?
what is a conversation?
what is a public collection of notes?
https://t.co/gk21mKYPqC

2022-12-04 at 21:30:09: that post now contains one [EDIT] parenthetical, but otherwise remains essentially the same except for maybe a few links added to pieces I hadn't yet written

years later I reflected about the nature of unintegrated understandings:
https://t.co/bD5JeI8epP

2022-12-04 at 21:30:09: somehow there's a sweet spot where something can be written as a snapshot of my learning at a point in time, and also its potency and clarity stands the test of time and it becomes "canon"

I feel like I really achieved this here:
https://t.co/MyrnAMacBb

2022-12-04 at 21:30:08: ...but also... a blog post FEELS like a final thing, but because it DOES have a date on it, it becomes complex to edit it because I neither want to imply that: 1. I stand behind all confusions remaining post-edits
2. I already had shit figured out years ago

2022-12-04 at 21:30:08: but weirdly it feels more easy to publish a page on the complice site that I could edit later, than a blog post that I could edit later.

I think that's partially because many of my reads come from the post being sent as a newsletter....

2022-12-04 at 21:30:08: part of the magic of being unable to edit twitter threads is that they HAVE to always only be a snapshot of how you were seeing it at the time. they can't be "kept up to date with the latest insights"

2022-12-04 at 21:30:07: but part of what makes things difficult I think IS actually the aim of creating a CANONICAL resource

that was easy to write as a thread, since it was overtly a draft, but with my blog posts I feel they want to be more DONE before I publish them
https://t.co/EUvFYcEAa7

2022-12-04 at 21:30:07: which is an argument in favor of just publishing things now

eg I started trying to edit this thread into a blog post and ended up flipping inside out and rethinking the whole frame.
https://t.co/MxMdZp6s8J

2022-12-04 at 21:30:06: although actually... maybe that's just not true. I've had lots of fresh ideas in the course of editing old posts

and sometimes those ideas are so fresh they then make it hard to publish the thing because what felt almost-done now feels woefully inadequate

2022-12-04 at 21:30:06: anyway, I'm going to try rewriting this, mostly, not trying to edit the other one to fit a new container, partially because I'm way better at writing than editing (and I enjoy it more) and partially because then I'll have more potential for new fresh ideas

2022-12-04 at 21:30:06: I don't want to become one of those guys who writes the same book 5 times in different contexts...

...but I am so far from that it's not really something I have to worry about. And it's not even bad that he does this‚Äîremixing something to a new context is helpful! https://t.co/HEW5iBDP1C

2022-12-04 at 21:30:04: and so even repackaging the ideas inside a different question ends up being very different!

this, but on a micro-scale, including my own ideas:
https://t.co/0u7rjUcKX9

2022-12-04 at 21:30:04: and I realized that even if the "awayness can't aim" piece says literally 100% of what this thread needs to say, and perfectly, it says it inside a different container. it's not what someone will find if they're *looking* for resources on non-coercion

2022-12-04 at 21:30:04: but then I remembered what I just spent the morning talking about with @visakanv (recorded! will be live on youtube soon) which included a bunch of reflections on the writing process: remixing, repeating, writing 101s and canonical versions

2022-12-04 at 21:30:03: and while writing it I pulled up this blog post of mine since it seemed relevant

and I was like "damn this already says most of what I want to say in this thread"

https://t.co/JPt78ZVeAb

2022-12-04 at 21:30:03: so after sending a few links, I started writing a thread from @CompliceGoals to provide a complice-y introduction to non-coercion and non-coercive motivation

and that's coming along

2022-12-04 at 21:30:03: from my DMs:

&gt; wanted to let you know I‚Äôve been trying out complice and it‚Äôs been really useful - the whole non coercive approach is really like, relaxing
&gt; it feels good to use
&gt; Do you have any resources on non coercion as a concept? Like are there any canonical writings etc

2022-12-04 at 21:30:02: writing canonical resources is hard and confusing

thread of me thinking out loud about repeating, remixing, and the differences between:
- twitter threads (dated, can't edit)
- blog posts (dated, can edit)
- pages/canon (not dated, can edit)

2022-12-04 at 21:24:39: tweets are like utterances

2022-12-04 at 20:57:43: I don't have to repeat myself
but I am free to repeat myself

2022-12-04 at 20:57:42: I cannot repeat an idea, no matter how many times I've said it before, without finding a slightly new angle on it
https://t.co/0u7rjUcKX9

2022-12-03 at 08:46:56: "neologizing" is a word

2022-12-03 at 08:45:18: "genshit" = the kind of almost-coherent stuff GPT comes up with when it doesn't quite know what's going on

not all generated text is genshit!

if it's:
- factually answering a question
- accurately summarizing something
- reasoning appropriately
that's something else https://t.co/Sp4PA60th7

2022-12-03 at 08:38:00: @jessicamalonso and then the other wave of impact on normies will be the dilution of certain types of stuff. in the same way SEO optimization has really fucked up search, generative text will create an absurd amount of CONTENT. idk exactly what the effect will be, but it'll affect everyone

2022-12-03 at 08:36:36: @jessicamalonso but more specific applications will come... at minimum various well-trained chatbots &amp; storytelling bots to help with specific kinds of problems/challenges/situations from the concrete to the emotional to the technical to the spiritual

2022-12-03 at 08:34:35: @jessicamalonso yeah the main immediate impacts for normies will be in writing school essays and doing homework. which will be hugely disruptive

beyond that, further implications will hinge on more specific applications. streaming vids makes a small diff pre netflix.

2022-12-03 at 06:00:04: @nosilverv I tried asking ChatGPT and it basically just says "this is EA. this is Buddism. they are different. thus, maybe they aren't readily compatible" which is like those auto-generated "X vs Y" sites that don't actually compare they just say "X is A.

2022-12-03 at 05:23:17: okay this is neat. I figured I'd start my post with some examples of things that are and aren't coercion, and ChatGPT definitely seems to be tracking the same distinction I am (I'm not aiming to say anything original on that level) https://t.co/UTPqqfHou4

2022-12-03 at 05:23:16: I'm fooling around with ChatGPT, and figured I might as well ask it about the topic I'm writing about:

2022-12-03 at 05:23:03: playing around with GPT is making me think maybe we need a new term for the sounds-good-but-isn't-coherent stuff it says

I can empathize however I want to and feel however I do when I do. I don't have to try to feel a particular way about a friend or homeless person who is suffering. I can be aware of them and simply feel how I do.

2022-11-29 at 01:04:04: @elonmusk If Apple makes an iPhone and someone makes a native app that would have no distribution and no ability to operate at all without Apple's tech, then Apple has earned the 30%.

2022-11-29 at 00:44:39: @elonmusk Imagine if your computer operating system tried to take 30% of all purchases you make on your computer. Now, Apple can't interfere with browser-based purchases, but they can (and allegedly *have*) made browser apps shittier to force more native apps.

2022-11-29 at 00:40:13: @elonmusk To anyone arguing that this isn't a secret (including Community Notes üòÖ) the secret is that they're pretty aggressive about forcing any payments on iOS to be *via* them, EVEN IF the majority of your value comes from the network, not the nativeness of the app.

and that's what counts.
that's why even tho the GCI is 5h long, it's mostly not made of presentations, it's made of work sessions

2022-11-21 at 21:30:08: Allie would probably never actually open the handbook at all, let alone watch the videos.

and even if she did, she would be likely to read it partway and then say, ‚Äúhmm yeah I really should do these exercises‚Äù

2022-11-21 at 21:30:07: those aspects are great, but it's easy to focus on these and miss how much of the power of the event comes from the container

2022-11-21 at 21:30:06: tip 2: make an appointment with someone else

if there's a chance you simply might not show up, put a time on the calendar with a friend. you'll still mostly introspect during the hour, but having social accountability will make it happen at all

2022-11-21 at 21:30:05: tip 1: get clear on what the plan is

once the appointment starts, don't take more than 5 minutes to figure out how you're going to spend it

you don't need to have a perfect plan, you just need a decent one
https://t.co/x52m2TRfNZ

2022-11-21 at 21:30:05: you can do this with specific object-level situations, eg ‚ÄúI need to get around to submitting that application‚Äù or with more abstract things like ‚ÄúI really should take more time to reflect on my life.‚Äù

2022-11-21 at 21:30:04: then, when the time comes, take your own advice. You can do this literally‚Äîconsider what advice you‚Äôd give a friend in your situation, then do that‚Äîor you can just do the obvious thing

https://t.co/sU3GNBJXqg

2022-11-21 at 21:30:04: put an event on your calendar, and treat it with the respect you‚Äôd give any other appointment

which is to say: show up

or, if for some reason it turns out you can‚Äôt, then reschedule for the nearest appropriate time

2022-11-21 at 21:30:04: but sometimes it's more a matter of simply not taking the time to apply your own wisdom to your own situation. your friend came to you asking for help, maybe, but you're too stuck in the weeds

the solution: make an appointment with your own wisdom

2022-11-21 at 21:30:03: usually this implies that there‚Äôs some sort of internal conflict present‚Äîa competing commitment that gets in the way of doing the thing that the person might consider reasonable

2022-11-21 at 00:16:47: often my awareness kicks in when I'm reaching for chocolate etc

so the new practice is:
- inhibit that at whatever phase
- check if my bladder's full, and if so:
‚ÄÉ- leave the snack
‚ÄÉ- go pee
‚ÄÉ- return to what I was doing

then maybe some minutes later true hunger will be obvious

2022-11-21 at 00:16:47: the thing is, it does require an active will towards bothering to notice, the same way that someone who moves needs to pay a different kind of attention on their commute so they don't accidentally drive to their old home instead of their new one

2022-11-21 at 00:16:47: if I find myself strugging to uphold this commitment, THEN I'll consider that I must have some sort of inner conflict about it, and seek to figure out what it is

but as far as I can tell, even time I notice this it's just hilarious &amp; obvious that I want to do something different

2022-11-21 at 00:16:46: a thing I use willpower for: overriding unconflicted autopilots

I started grabbing a snack on the way to pee, &amp; years later sometimes I go grab a snack and get back to my room &amp; realize my bladder's still full ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I'm now committing to completing bathroom trips before any snack

NOT to do them
than to do them.

2022-11-20 at 23:54:59: @gptbrooke different people have dramatically different ideas about the extent to which it's possible for your whole cognitive/motivational system to integratedly understand things like xrisk, rather than having to override parts that don't get it

I'm in the "absolutely 100% possible" camp

2022-11-20 at 23:53:52: @gptbrooke and if you've got resistance when you try to work on something important and neglected, then that means some part of you thinks it's a bad bet or that something else matters more, whether for the world or for yourself

you're free to try anyway
https://t.co/RJHsMa9XcZ

2022-11-20 at 23:53:35: that doesn't mean it's DEFINITELY a bad idea to drive with the handbrake on.

if you've gotta get to the hospital &amp; brake is stuck, but it's drivable, then you choose how much time you want to spend troubleshooting before just driving‚Äîall power* to you!

*except power wasted üòÖ

2022-11-20 at 23:51:00: @gptbrooke yep

pay deep attention to what's important and neglected, and also notice where your attention gravitates

truly seeing that something important is neglected IS motivating, but different things will still motivate different people

also I've been thinking about solopreneurs/indiehackers as one great potential target market for https://t.co/lRiGUxBOZ9, so I'd love to get your feedback on how the site (landing page or app itself) does or doesn't appeal to you

2022-11-12 at 01:36:43: @thetracebrady @palmerish @visakanv the main one I'm particularly familiar with is the tendency to recursively bite off more than one can chew 

and to treat many things as if they're gonna happen in an attempt to get an upward spiral of buy-in going, then hiding or panicking when there isn't actually enough buy-in

2022-11-12 at 01:34:43: @m_ashcroft @DRMacIver that's what it's for. pithy QTables are where it's at!

2022-11-12 at 01:31:54: @forthrighter makes sense! that's kinda vaguely what I figured

yes I go to great lengths to make sure my clients never assume I'm qualified in any particular way, let alone certified

2022-11-12 at 01:30:12: @andrew0blevins haha nice remix

2022-11-11 at 21:37:10: sometimes I talk to people about their relationships and help them untangle stuff

am I allowed to call that couples counselling or is that a protected term like "therapy"?

(I may not WANT to call it that, for other reasons, but that's a separate Q)

2022-11-11 at 21:34:33: @hmmmcurious hmmm yeah maybe. I haven't actually looked into the technical details of what happened in a lot of depth

2022-11-11 at 21:14:45: @ChasingMyself nice
I was sorta feeling like there had to be a good answer something like this, vaguely like the Half Plus Seven rule

2022-11-11 at 21:04:54: @daemonhugger @GeorgeKao I don't think of it as "the other direction"

there's at least:
üì¢ broadcasting (one-to-many)
üóíÔ∏è public notes (one-to-zero)
üí¨ public conversation (one-to-one-to-one)
üï∏Ô∏è collective cognition (many-to-many)

3 &amp; 4 are where I see the juice

2022-11-11 at 20:54:47: being heard by the other person is never directly in your control, yet it's the thing you most want

2022-11-11 at 20:44:10: what's the 80/20 rule? wrong answers only

2022-11-11 at 01:58:32: @monotremism another thing that's been clarifying for me is that when I hang out with ~normie parents/kids I'm like üò≥üò¨üò±üò¢ but when I hang out with parents/kids who are more my type of person I'm like ü§©ü•∞ü•πü§Ø

and since I'm my type of person, probably my situation will be the latter

2022-11-11 at 01:56:58: @monotremism yeah. it's tough‚ÄîI didn't really think I wanted kids ~7 years ago, then gradually increasingly have sensed I probably do, and now part of what makes it really clear for me that I do is that I want kids *with my partner in particular*

so it's not statically knowable

2022-11-11 at 01:55:16: @JoeBaco2 whatever seems like it's got the most traction available
or something

alternatively just actually BOTH the shit out of it

2022-11-11 at 01:54:29: @americafranco18 @utotranslucence this reminded me somewhat of our convo last night, tho maybe it's a different axis

2022-11-10 at 23:48:01: @nat_sharpe_ @JakeOrthwein was quoting John Vervaeke as saying something to that effect

addiction is a reciprocal narrowing
meaning is a reciprocal opening

("reciprocal" as in a positive feedback loop, I think)

2022-11-10 at 22:49:29: the fact that so much decision-making capacity hinges on a small number of votes is a sign the system is fragile and failing to meaningfully aggregate (let alone synthesize) the preferences &amp; knowledge of its constituents

2022-11-10 at 19:00:35: torn between my desire to pay for twitter and access twitter blue features (which I already do, the $4 version) and my desire to countersignal by not purchasing products associated with status signalling

2022-11-10 at 18:41:23: @jessicamalonso I personally find it absurd to have any sign of unread notifications on twitter at all (except for DMs) so I removed them. If I can see unreads I feel compelled to clear them, but it's a feed to dip into, not an inbox to keep at zero.

So I fixed it:
https://t.co/IKl32XdDb8

2022-11-10 at 18:37:19: @jessicamalonso and my sense is that while it's possible and worthwhile to access a worldview without blame-based explanations at all...

...as long as blame is there, it's genuinely trying to help you understand what happened and navigate the future, and simply letting go of it would be naive

2022-11-10 at 18:36:39: @jessicamalonso yeah, you're free to have your feelings until you have other feelings you want to have instead and then you're free to have those

2022-11-10 at 18:26:44: reads as sincere to me, given everything I know

I'm sure some people have a really strong prior on SBF being a bad actor (I don't, I have friends who know him &amp; his vibe)

2022-11-10 at 00:21:44: equanimity is great but have you tried solving your problems?

2022-11-09 at 21:57:35: this thread dovetails quite closely with a bunch of my work on building scalable high-trust groups

there's always the puzzle of how the expectations necessarily evolve when someone new joins https://t.co/hmTcSmGQ81

2022-11-09 at 21:56:40: @visakanv and it might actually be that the existing norms weren't bad for the existing group members, but *are* bad for the new guy... and then depending on why the new guy is joining, it may or may not be a priority to actually find new norms that work for everybody!

2022-11-09 at 21:28:17: @andrewkuznet neat! I think it's kind of a bad sign tho

https://t.co/4sgQuCkTnm

2022-11-09 at 21:25:42: @monotremism on the contrary, if one of you wants kids and the other doesn't and there's no sign that that's likely to evolve, then "certainly feels like your person" is an illusion because your *actual* person would want roughly what you want here!

&amp; ask your bodies:
https://t.co/HUQyWeUceN

2022-11-09 at 21:23:49: @monotremism like it might be that the obvious places to live all hit one of your dealbreakers, but if you really brainstorm what it's all about, you can figure out an option neither of you had considered that would be ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•ü§©üöÄü§ò

2022-11-09 at 21:22:51: @monotremism like human capability and capacity to solve difficult problems is very very large if you're unconflicted about solving them, and arranging your life to be with the one you love is exactly the sort of thing people regularly move mountains for

2022-11-09 at 21:22:03: @monotremism there are two kinds of challenge here:
1. envisioning a world that you would both in fact deeply want
2. bringing that world about

if you can get really fucking clear on #1, you can expect to have tremendous motivation &amp; creativity towards #2

if you can't get clear on #1, nvm

but it looks like the independents include Bernie, and they caucus with the dems, so eh

2022-11-09 at 16:31:45: I don't think we've really reckoned with the extent to which people use open browser tabs as a to-do list

2022-11-09 at 07:12:07: huh, yeah, there really is a whole thing about intentionality here

intentionality is about experiencing whatever you're doing as part of a learning process that will inform the rest of your life
https://t.co/ZZh4MMfk4R

2022-11-09 at 07:12:07: some of these I'm doing to really try to encourage myself to do more of them

others I'm doing more because I think I'll learn something from intentionally tracking it, eg 100 sangrias (I love sangria, but they vary a lot) or U-intros

49/100 vids (my main focus, currently in my twitter name)

one of my new challenges is "100 angers expressed", which is really satisfying so far (I'm already at 5!)

19/100 challenges started

https://t.co/UR4ufLl7Iu

2022-11-09 at 07:12:06: I could have included "write 100 songs" or something, which is another thing I've already done, but I didn't, and I don't think I'm about to now.

I do have a "release 100 more songs" (counting since the start of 2022) which has hit 3 so far

2022-11-09 at 07:12:05: the other already-done 100 I counted was this threadapalooza of "what if it were good tho?" ideas

(I now phrase this "what if we made it good tho?" since it's less ambiguous)

https://t.co/RJbYZMRr9q

2022-11-09 at 07:12:05: I started by taking credit for having already written 100 blog posts, since that's a classic challenge that Visa often issues people

(as do I, although my more usual trick is challenging people to even make a blog in the first place)
https://t.co/WwAXLRK6gU

2022-11-09 at 07:12:04: do 100 "do 100 things"

I embarked on this challenge in May 2022

I'm tracking it privately in a spreadsheet called "DoubleVisa 100√ó100", but figured I'd make a public thread to log bigger picture progress

2022-11-09 at 07:07:00: also you can solve problems one-by-one. you don't have to solve them all at once for the fully general case first. 

in fact, uhh... good luck with that.

2022-11-09 at 03:52:57: I say just start with wordpress‚Äã.com if you don't have a good reason to think something else is better (for you, or philosophically) - it's got tons of themes &amp; plugins

2022-11-09 at 03:52:51: which platform to use? doesn't really matter!

it's kinda hard to switch later, but not as hard as HAVING ALREADY STARTED A BLOG YEARS AGO is compared to starting one now

&amp; it'll never be worth switching if you never get started

2022-11-09 at 03:52:45: your first problem is you don't have a blog

THEN you can worry about more advanced problems like:
- my blog is ugly
- it has a dumb placeholder name
- there's nothing on my blog
- it has no readers

but you don't get to graduate to those UNTIL you solve "I don't have a blog" https://t.co/uz1S11e1Cv

2022-11-09 at 03:52:35: your first problem is you don't have a blog https://t.co/uz1S11e1Cv

2022-11-09 at 03:45:04: your reward for solving the problem is more problems
usually, fortunately, you get more interesting problems

2022-11-09 at 03:30:46: I wrote it in gdocs but I found myself making the paragraphs tweet-sized, so it was easy to then thread and I figured it'd be funner to share the current draft there than to link you to a gdoc

2022-11-09 at 03:30:46: I'd love feedback on any level of abstraction (could even be just "this is awesome do 99 more from different angles").

2022-11-09 at 03:30:45: in other words, I'm realizing the Complice site needs to have writing with way higher higher memetic potential, more likely to go viral (maybe someone will post it on Hacker News or whatever)

2022-11-09 at 03:30:45: the idea is it would encourage people to start eg identifying as someone who prioritizes intentionality, not productivity, &amp; share the article as part of explaining their lifestyle/approach, regardless of whether they've even tried Complice

2022-11-09 at 03:30:45: hey @visakanv, following your suggestion for Complice to do marketing via sharing its opinionated viewpoint, I wrote a new take on the complice philosophy, intended to be a page on the site

2022-11-09 at 02:30:58: @any_other_you alternatively, maybe you're not here on twitter to have conversations, in which case you do you!

2022-11-08 at 22:03:38: @Petes2001 @RepSwalwell say more? I haven't heard about this

2022-11-08 at 22:01:04: @hankgreen @elonmusk @hankgreen I realized that I think it would be helpful if you actually articulated what the issue is with Elon's tweet, from your perspective, since it's not clear to me after a few minutes of thinking about it so it's surely not clear to anyone who disagrees with you (eg Elon)

2022-11-08 at 21:59:15: @JayBo3331 @hankgreen @keithgoldsby @elonmusk I'm myself not remotely clear what Hank's take is on *why* the original tweet by Elon is undermining people's trust! so it's not that useful feedback unfortunately :(

- engaging with politics altogether?
- suggesting voting R?
- referring to "worst excesses"?

...something else?

2022-11-08 at 21:55:39: @JayBo3331 @hankgreen @keithgoldsby @elonmusk paraphrasing Hank's tweet, while I'm at it:

Elon, I want to help you by highlighting ways where you seem to be systematically burning trust with people who you need to have trust you in order to achieve what you want (twitter as info commons not fan club)
https://t.co/5CwMdYdaxN

2022-11-08 at 21:53:04: @JayBo3331 @hankgreen @keithgoldsby @elonmusk but it looks like Hank is sincerely attempting to offer feedback to Elon on how to build trust with people like him, and it doesn't seem like Elon's listening that well

I initially misread Hank as implying that Elon *wanted* twitter to become a $8/mo elon fan club tho, so...

2022-11-08 at 21:44:45: @m_ashcroft I sorta thought about it back when I was thinking about replacing twitter rather than fixing it, but maybe around the time that they made QTs more of a top-level feature I realized that probably fixing twitter is the way to go

2022-11-08 at 21:27:44: @mckinleaf @RichDecibels @cdr @m_ashcroft but also this
(although this may be more due to timely drama than anything else)

but twitter itself won't be behind a paywall, that'd be absurd

2022-11-08 at 21:23:58: @DRMacIver I had a part show up as a fox once

2022-11-08 at 21:22:32: 1. which emoji set do you generally prefer?
2. what's an exception? (an emoji you think another set did way better)

üòÅ (top row, ugly on most platforms)
ü§© (G: same color as üòç, Tw close, Apple yellow like bg) https://t.co/bR9nKGnq1y

2022-11-08 at 21:14:55: @JayBo3331 @hankgreen @keithgoldsby @elonmusk thanks! I personally thought Elon was pretty clear about what he meant in his original tweet, but it's easy to pattern-match it onto something else, so I figured I'd try to paraphrase it

2022-11-08 at 21:12:33: if you're not having fun on twitter try an experiment where for every tweet that shows up on your timeline you either reply to it or unfollow whoever tweeted it

2022-11-08 at 20:59:50: @CarstenStolz yeah, makes sense! if you've got a bunch of mental activity going into correcting yourself, it'll tend to correct others too

2022-11-08 at 20:59:21: @CarstenStolz math is also a much safer context to let people make mistakes! especially since eventually they'll either figure it out or realize they're stuck, rather than struggling forever or gradually getting injured

2022-11-08 at 20:58:28: @jambarree say more? do you have specific questions or critiques?

2022-11-07 at 21:04:33: Elon's seriously planning to reorganize twitter so that everyone is getting information they find meaningful, relevant, and valuable out of it
https://t.co/cHsg5aV1Mc

2022-11-07 at 21:04:33: Part of what's going on is confused concepts of authority. The CDC felt their authority was being questioned by people talking about how maybe they were wrong. And frankly, it was! But that's appropriate and inevitable in this era. Maintaining cred via suppression doesn't work!

2022-11-07 at 21:04:33: But it's very common to see perspectives that don't match yours as lying/bullshitting (or cultural norms that don't match yours as defecting)

People need, for their own sanity, to actually LEARN how to identify the differences.

2022-11-07 at 21:04:32: Part of the puzzle here is... identifying people's motives?
truthseeking üßê genuinely reporting what you see, to try to figure out what's going on
advancing a cause ü´° you may lie or bullshit or palter, to get people to vote or whatever  
sowing discord üí© whatever fucks shit up

2022-11-07 at 21:04:32: People who were genuinely trying to figure stuff out on twitter in the early days of covid got banned for claiming (or even positing) things that were at the time considered false by CDC/WHO, that later turned into CDC/WHO doctrine.

2022-11-07 at 21:04:31: I saw a critique about how this is compatible with free speech.

Easy: in order to have accurate information, everything needs to be sayable, AND people need to be able to find and organize what they see. Free speech is a necessary pre-req to accurate info. https://t.co/foLlso8gaZ

2022-11-07 at 21:02:10: @hankgreen @keithgoldsby @elonmusk I think what he's saying is that he doesn't trust either party and would prefer to force them to compromise rather than letting them implement their agenda directly.

I mean ideally we'd have dialogue &amp; win-wins, not compromise, but that's a ways off.

2022-11-07 at 20:49:48: @mandymadethis @stevenmarkryan @elonmusk wikipedia doesn't handle conflicting points of view and dialogue, it just handles things that are relatively well-established and agreed upon already

2022-11-07 at 20:40:19: @sashintweets @jonnym1ller @m_ashcroft oh wait, I was initially worried that our tendency to put things like "in SF" or "(49/100 vids)" would be problematic here

but it seems like maybe this is actually precisely the way to continually shed the checkmark üòõ

2022-11-07 at 20:39:33: @sashintweets @jonnym1ller @m_ashcroft I don't think it works like that‚Äîyou're allowed to have a pseudonym (and this is vital to how twitter works) so there's nothing to verify

I guess it's verifying that you're *not* looking like another user, and then making it harder to name change
https://t.co/7tVtTE6k6z

2022-11-07 at 20:37:29: @sashintweets yeah, hopefully the checkmark will actually just be one feature among many, and you can turn it off. seems unlikely though.

2022-11-07 at 20:29:58: major pre/post fallacy going on with people's interpretations of Elon's governance of twitter

it's quite instructive actually

2022-11-07 at 20:27:19: @elonmusk currently I guess replies are sorted mostly by likes/RTs, which correlates with follower count and polemic takes

what if we used a similar sort algo to Notes/@birdwatch, where the top-ranked tweets were ones liked/RT'd by a range of disparate accounts?

2022-11-07 at 20:22:32: @elonmusk verifying people for $8 can ensure they're not impostors, and maybe can make it costly to ban people for spamming the same tweet 100 times. good!

but that's removing the bottom 50%
it doesn't touch the question of which top 2% of replies are worth engaging with!

2022-11-07 at 20:18:56: so the replies to @elonmusk's tweets are mostly garbage, but there are some earnest conversational replies that I get to see because I'm following the people who made them

seems it would be a huge win to optimize the reply sort algo until Elon's stoked to read his replies

2022-11-07 at 19:47:33: @ungatedcreative @m_ashcroft that's the main reason I started paying for twitter blue when I first had the chance

2022-11-06 at 17:33:46: but it turns out we don't need "I ain't" though because we can always say "I'm not" instead. so conveniently it was easy to drop.

which isn't true for "isn't" because "isn't" goes after any singular noun, not just the "I" pronoun!

2022-11-06 at 17:33:46: TIL that "ain't" was originally short for "am not" and was considered proper until it started getting used in place of "isn't" &amp; "aren't" &amp; "hasn't", &amp; tagged as cockney as such

2022-11-04 at 01:36:18: Also, if you claim to do only correct-to-source, that strategy means making your lineage lossy (even though it's probably sneakily correcting-to-reality anyway!)

eg "any wisdom herein is from my teachers; any mistakes are my own"

it's bullshit

2022-11-04 at 01:36:17: Then there are situations where the source is uhh kinda gone. Nobody can ask Jesus what he meant by "the meek shall inherit the earth" [in aramaic]. We can ask a priest, or the Pope, who... maybe know? They claim to know. Hmm.

2022-11-04 at 01:36:17: If you tell me something and it doesn't fit with reality-as-it-seems-to-me, then it's important that I don't take your word(-as-I-interpret-it) as fact, or I'll go kinda crazy.

But if I assume *you're* just crazy, then I'll miss out on whatever signal *is* in what you're saying.

2022-11-04 at 01:36:16: Propagating information, whether forward in time (in personal or collective memory) or between people (communication) requires error-correction.

It seems there are two kinds:
‚ÄÉ- correct to source

Both are important, but they have different roles.

https://t.co/7LvBryPvlq

2022-11-03 at 20:59:25: @rmbalt ahh yeah, it's not a vowel in that case no

but the latineks construction isn't exactly vowel either...

2022-11-03 at 20:56:09: @AskYatharth well, approximately. something not entirely unlike exactly.

2022-11-02 at 21:16:09: on a Complice team call with @joyurge just now, he pointed out that the Complice philosophy says "choosing &amp; doing, over organizing" but the Today page has "Organize" as a main verb

2022-10-31 at 18:44:36: @relic_radiation but framing it as "fitness" sort of implies it's a Thing, and it's not a Thing it's an ongoing and also-evolving relationship between the organism and its environment

like "most collaborative" is ALSO a competition on a different level of abstraction

2022-10-31 at 18:43:34: @relic_radiation yeah to really grok evolution you need to back up to the level of simply "there'll tend to be more of the sorts of things that are good at sticking around &amp; making more of themselves"

"fitness" is theoretically shorthand for that, whatever the strategy (indiv or collab or w/e)

https://t.co/doqLl62X3s

2022-10-29 at 23:32:37: @markus3141597 that seems roughly true to me...
- "liberal" gets conflated with "left" which broadly supports more socialist policies these days
- insofar as people want to keep what's working about classical liberalism, they come across as conservative

but how does it seem to you?

2022-10-29 at 23:31:18: @markus3141597 agreed! too much conservativism and not enough progressivism means continuing to screw over people who are currently getting screwed over

https://t.co/p3fnjUFbxs

2022-10-29 at 23:24:53: @BretWeinstein @elonmusk There's also, both with the council and with twitter as a platform, structural decisions that make actual dialogue &amp; deep listening way easier, and talking past each other harder and less attractive.

Lots of design work to do there‚Äîhappy to help on both fronts.

2022-10-29 at 23:18:17: @BretWeinstein @elonmusk Yup, evolutionary approach is definitely where it's at. The puzzle here is to find people with diverse values &amp; priorities politically, who share a commitment to freeing speech whenever‚Äîand however‚Äîthat's safe to do so, AND who are capable of listening deeply to each other.

https://t.co/Ufw9NAUo3v

2022-10-28 at 18:56:17: Now, it's worth noting that being deeply heard by yourself is NOT the same as (or a total replacement for) being heard by the person you have a conflict with. And insofar as part of you is angry that they haven't heard you yet, validate *that* part too! That matters!

2022-10-28 at 18:56:17: I call this "empowered dialogue" because this always offers a way out of the victim stance. We always want to start with 3 (you hear me) but get blocked because the OTHER person wants to be heard first too (2). By hearing &amp; validating OURSELVES first (1) we gain space to listen

2022-10-28 at 18:56:16: Three steps for empowered dialogue:
1. see &amp; affirm your own perspective deeply
2. hear the other person &amp; take their perspective to their satisfaction
3. when they feel so heard that they can't help get curious about how you're seeing things, share your own perspective

2022-10-28 at 18:53:07: most inability to listen comes from either:
1. lack of motivation (could be selfish curiosity or just desire to have the other person feel heard)
2. not feeling grounded enough in the reality of your own perspective to feel safe to take someone else's without losing your own

2022-10-28 at 18:27:01: "an understanding catalyst" is a great term in general and also a great term for one of the roles I'm learning to take and to train others how to take

2022-10-28 at 15:33:08: @markus3141597 yes. good conservatism on its own has no direction whatsoever. in fact it mostly says "let's go slowly and care-fully, and check with people before flipping their tables"

to be very very clear: YOU DO NOT HAVE TO. I am not telling you you must, if you think that's disgusting because they're so fuzzy. you can keep scooping or peeling

2022-10-25 at 16:57:09: conservativism, properly held, has a very humble tone:

2022-10-25 at 16:19:44: interesting to notice that a half-century later pre-processed foods are increasingly available (and my grandmother loves them as she's so done with chopping but she can throw stuff in the oven) but they completely haven't taken over the sale of raw foods

2022-10-25 at 16:18:05: @TylerAlterman on rare occasions, usually some kind of loss or loneliness, I've sometimes fallen into a space where all my usual bubbliness and energy is gone

it's probably kinda dissociative

2022-10-25 at 16:15:11: &gt; Preprocessed foods are not only here but are gaining such a tremendous acceptance that soon there will be little else on the market.

https://t.co/9Gg1j3QDVa

2022-10-22 at 16:25:15: @goblinodds to the extent this is true, the thing to be ragey about is the implication that the way to not be creepy is to not have desires, because that idea is a large part of what leads to creepiness! or amplifies it, at least

2022-10-22 at 16:24:18: @goblinodds I've gotten a lot of mileage out of the perspective that creepiness is largely a function of having sexual desire while trying to hide or deny it...

such a definition would straightforwardly imply that pretending to be asexual to avoid making someone uncomfortable *is* creepy.

2022-10-22 at 16:18:05: @rachelclif @groundedSAGE oh my. say more?

2022-10-22 at 05:43:03: @Hi_individual1 and each claim that someone is part of a named entity (which "tpot" functions as and "this part of twitter" mostly doesn't) who doesn't want to be part of that named entity, is an interaction that alienates people from people they want to connect with

2022-10-22 at 05:42:10: @Hi_individual1 agreed, and each use of an acronym not transparent to outsiders creates actual interactions with those outsiders that cast them as outsiders

2022-10-22 at 05:39:42: @DvnnyyPhantom fair, tho I'm not here to tell you what to do‚ÄîI'm just pointing out the impact of the acronym (as I see it)

2022-10-22 at 05:10:51: @AFarnsy it doesn't directly have a framework for those, but it's quite good for improvisationally trying out different questions towards goals

ie it doesn't assume whatsoever that what you did today towards the goal is the same thing you'll need to do tomorrow, etc

2022-10-22 at 05:09:47: @s_r_constantin in my experience, when someone realizes their desires are incoherent (which more likely when accepting them as okay) then the desires tend to reorganize to become workable
ethics is a subcase of this, as far as I can tell‚Äîwanting to be ethical according to your standards

2022-10-22 at 05:05:12: @hamnox yeah "okay" is underdefined/overloaded
but it evokes something
which is sort of what I was trying to do here

2022-10-22 at 05:00:14: @DvnnyyPhantom 21 chars to spare:
&gt; I am constantly impressed by my mutuals and most of this part of twitter, I haven‚Äôt found that anywhere else on the internet or even IRL and it‚Äôs a big part of why I stay. I always wonder if y‚Äôall feel the same way about this part of twitter and your mutuals.

2022-10-22 at 04:58:27: @also_louis the thing is that I think many people doing the abbreviating don't remotely realize that it creates exclusivity

they're just failing to take people's perspectives, but that's most people most of the time

2022-10-22 at 04:55:53: @JohnStokvis @visakanv agreed although you do actually have to integrate them and there's such a thing as too much difference!
https://t.co/5CLzUUaRQV

2022-10-22 at 04:48:37: @Hi_individual1 you're not wrong
but it's particularly true in this case

2022-10-22 at 04:46:37: @laurex tho in this case it's very much a thought experiment not something I think is likely to happen

regardless, this ambiguity can be 99% mitigated by just saying "hi sadness". tone also matters a lot here. can be playful but need to be deeply sincere

2022-10-22 at 03:17:20: @OwenTho41916182 was being sincere! if the test-reader actually points out the paragraph or sentence at which their eyes glazed over, this can pinpoint an area that needs more concreteness or a better segue or motivator for the next section

2022-10-14 at 15:40:21: so maybe the thing I actually want to add to complice is a button/mode/UI where you say "hey, umm, situation changed, gotta reorient"

and it guides you through reorganizing and not-today-ing your intentions until they make sense again https://t.co/YBU8vygK4w

2022-10-14 at 15:40:19: one thing I am noticing is that while I don't have time this morning to finish this writing that was my big task for today, there are a few other things that'll only take 5 or 10 minutes that I can totally do before I go see mum, and it'll feel really good to do those!

2022-10-14 at 15:40:19: I've thought for awhile about adding a button for scrapping one's plans for the day‚Äîactually I think I did add a hidden hotkey for that for a using with a kind of surprise chronic fatigue!

but idk if that's quite right either

2022-10-14 at 15:40:18: like today I had a few hours of stuff I wanted to do before hanging out with my mum all afternoon, but instead of waking up at like 9 or 10 I woke up at 11:30 üòï

2022-10-14 at 15:40:18: one thing that messes me up when using https://t.co/lRiGUxBOZ9 sometimes is when I set intentions the night before, then I sleep in, and now those intentions are totally unrealistic for the day

a kind of micro-staleness I guess

2022-10-14 at 15:00:32: you do know that listening deeply to your doubts can make your grand theory of everything better, right?

2022-10-14 at 05:11:36: @RichDecibels this video is @jgreenhall talking about this exact puzzle, which he calls "the meta-protocol" (a name I've also adopted for it)

https://t.co/QO2OKFRzpY

2022-10-14 at 05:10:44: @RichDecibels I will go on about this at great length, please ask Qs!

some more surface area in the replies to this tweet, including some very relevant videos
https://t.co/l0647IMQoz

2022-10-14 at 05:07:56: @RichDecibels ummm *raises hand* ‚úã
my work is super theoretical compared to Taiwan etc
though still grounded in embodied practice

more focused on finding the core assumptions/stances about norms, memes, etc, that enable respecting differences

but I am working on exactly what you describe

2022-10-14 at 05:03:27: RT @RichDecibels: I'm looking for exemplary cases of coherent pluralism. what communities, thinkers, movements, schools of thought etc come‚Ä¶

2022-10-14 at 05:00:33: @MasterTimBlais @AskYatharth yeah there's some really trippy stuff around how a given material has a heat at which it will sustain burning, and a higher heat at which it will ignite

found this out when researching what kinds of wax make for good fire-starters

2022-10-14 at 04:53:35: @strangestloop / Moth Fund

2022-10-14 at 04:53:14: @visakanv https://t.co/Ln6fyAuHjq

2022-10-14 at 04:50:05: @sashintweets That sounds cool! Let me know if you need more endpoints with the Complice API. I've got some hidden tools for making integrations more like the workflowy one, that I can get you set up with (best is to message me through the in-app intercom)

2022-10-14 at 04:28:03: @mollyfmielke reminds me of the difference between "freedom from" &amp; "freedom to"

and as soon as you're talking "freedom to", you have to know what you want!

2022-10-14 at 04:16:45: @TylerAlterman what are you working on atm? I'm realizing I don't actually know what needles you're trying to move, but from your tweets the last year I have a sense it's quite convergent with whatever the hell I'm doing, so I figured it'd be good to find out in more depth

2022-10-14 at 04:14:01: @lolalucxy mmmm yeah, once AI-based speech-to-text/command becomes another 9 more robust (from 99 to 99.9 or whatever) I might look into some controls like that for complice, which could be really good

I also experimented with having it ring your phone in the morning and read out your list

2022-10-14 at 04:13:05: @lolalucxy yeah agreed so hard, it really does go both ways in different moments. sort of depends on the tempo I'm in

maybe I could see that as Complice inviting me to slow down

2022-10-14 at 04:12:12: @tasshinfogleman I also really like how the album art turned out on my 2012 album (I did most of it: I drew a sketch that @tessafyi made into digital line art, then I added the colors/textures)

don't forget to breath, and remember 
https://t.co/4QuBX7cCBN

2022-10-14 at 03:53:41: for those who haven't explored the Complice approach yet, check it out here and let me know what you think and how it might be able to thread this needle even better!

https://t.co/MsHJgxQD9W

2022-10-14 at 03:51:40: I think it's possible to be living a life that's very vividly moving towards what you want, while having those wants be very open-ended

but it might be easier for some people to go from daydreamer to hitting explicit goals (eg @bmndr) than straight to pursuing nebulous desires https://t.co/kAFOEyVHHE

2022-10-14 at 03:51:39: as with systems-vs-goals, it seems like there's a similar thing here, where clarifying goals/values is useful but can have drawbacks, and there's ways to mitigate those

https://t.co/mdaL5P9L1L

2022-10-14 at 03:51:38: and the misc or overall sections of the weekly review can be used to balance things out

eg I don't have a health/fitness goal or a money goal right now, but I have a couple of questions related to that that I check in on weekly https://t.co/6woII26HT3

2022-10-14 at 03:51:37: Complice invites you to frame goals in ways that evoke a feeling that you can cultivate more of by orienting towards the goal

https://t.co/U0yFfrcmY6

2022-10-14 at 03:51:37: here's our concept of goal. no metric required!

https://t.co/5bUIovBs2F

2022-10-14 at 03:51:36: like insofar as metrics cause goodharting and narrow-mindedness, Complice is pretty good on that front
https://t.co/agbqb2gdZu

2022-10-14 at 03:51:36: ultimately this is a pretty cool thing, and Complice is good at keeping your goals fluid and evolving

https://t.co/dE9QI0gXkL

2022-10-14 at 03:51:35: "value collapse" is something I've noticed somewhat with myself and others, using the @CompliceGoals app to track their goals

...the system works a bit too well! if you don't put in a social goal, you can find yourself neglecting your social life, etc https://t.co/aQjftNLp36

2022-10-14 at 03:38:14: @sashintweets are those the only two boxes? absurd if nothing ticks those, they're like the two most obvious things

Complice has contextual filtering but obviously isn't GTD compatible because it doesn't have ongoing lists

2022-10-14 at 03:37:28: @vaughn_tan I feel like I know a person looking at this but I can't think of one

will say it loosely reminds me of both Naturalistic Decision-Making and cynefin

2022-10-14 at 03:36:35: @ejames_c came across this again and still very curious what you think of my take on NDM + trauma, if you have the chance to read it!

2022-10-14 at 03:26:25: Haven't thought about this list in awhile so kudos to @spencerc99's existence for reminding me of it!

https://t.co/TXA91tZPRk

and this thread:
https://t.co/nyNQaf7FTo

2022-10-14 at 03:26:05: "internets" is a word

intriguing how some nouns aren't seen as pluralizable (which *sigh* is also a word)

2022-10-14 at 03:22:55: @spencerc99 @sariazout wow, this is super cool. I'd love to have a (recorded?) call with you Spencer and just jam about these ideas

DM me if you wanna chat

2022-10-14 at 03:17:06: @aleksil79 What do you mean by "reciprocal handle"?

2022-10-14 at 03:17:01: @aleksil79 "get a reciprocal handle on all forms and scales of cognition" üòÆ

Sounds like what @drmichaellevin is working on! He's taking a mostly biological approach. This podcast blew my mind.

2022-10-14 at 03:09:25: a sentence about "specific trust-dancing style" from a doc:

any given person (or group) has a sense of what makes them feel safe/high-trust, and they want others to do those things, but by default not all of those things are doable by other people in ways that are integrated etc https://t.co/bYpuJVvTwb

2022-10-14 at 03:06:58: @UrgentWonder I'll probably watch it sometime. what was your biggest takeaway, in a tweet?

2022-10-14 at 03:04:16: @HiNaryan hey that's what I'M doing! give it back üòÜ

what are your main research questions?

my top one is something like "what are the best (fastest, most robust) paths for getting people to have a self-authored meta-protocol oriented paradigm?"

the rest: https://t.co/DfSFTsB5zK

2022-10-14 at 03:01:50: @ryiacy @visakanv the whole point of these is that they're super short
dip in, dip out, whatever

you're not signing up for a whole long program

2022-10-14 at 03:00:55: @mindmeanings I find it helps to really feel my own feeling fully, and let it detach if it wants but don't *try* to detach

2022-10-14 at 03:00:05: @Sameerish3re tho yeah I do believe it was designed for something like this purpose

2022-10-14 at 02:59:45: @Sameerish3re that term disgusts me lol

2022-10-14 at 02:53:32: @strangestloop you did! for some reason I thought it was a link to... something else. like maybe I thought it was the board game or something

2022-10-13 at 20:29:21: what if it's actually okay that you want what you want?

2022-10-13 at 15:43:37: something obvious to me about why this works that may not be obvious to *you*: "it seems to me" is much closer to the heart than "I think"

"I think" feels like a flimsy opinion someone can just dismiss as wrong
"it seems to me" is describing reality‚Äîfrom your perspective

2022-10-13 at 15:43:37: lyrics from a song I started playing around with last year:
https://t.co/CUnf6dCYEb

2022-10-13 at 15:43:37: in other words, it makes it a lot more straightforward for me to say what's obvious to me that may not be obvious whatsoever to others, without any sense of argument

https://t.co/yAnGl5jGc5

2022-10-13 at 15:43:36: I'm having a really satisfying experience of writing a summary of my worldview where each paragraph begins with "It seems to me that:"

It makes space for the rest of the paragraph to be clear &amp; bold &amp; non-hedging &amp; brief, without coming across as dogmatic or "you should agree"

2022-10-13 at 15:39:27: üé∂ from this point of view
üéµ it's kinda obvious... that this point of view
üé∂ isn't obvious from other points of view

2022-10-13 at 06:56:05: having a separate browser profile for twitter is like having a fridge

2022-10-13 at 06:54:31: @deevbrain whereas "ongoingly" feels a lot less obvious, more mind-expanding

2022-10-13 at 06:54:05: @f_j_j_ @leahprime @smiling_for_fun @Meaningness hmm I wasn't able to get a clear read on PIM reaction from searching it

this also seems very relevant:
https://t.co/PLXMvNlBX7

2022-10-13 at 06:51:10: I am increasingly positing that it's possible to be personally disgusted by someone else's choices ("ew, I would never do that") while not judging them as "wrong" in some objective sense

teasing these apart seems key for learning postjudgment without losing something vital

2022-10-13 at 05:58:54: capital-B Behaviorism was a niche theory that lasted less than a century, but it was a codification of some much older underlying assumptions about how motivation works, that are still with us, and PCT (Perceptual Control Theory) is questioning these

2022-10-13 at 05:47:33: I've been making sense of anger a bit the last few months, and I've found that often what's going on is that there's a powerful energy in me that is saying to a loved one "see me! feel me! take my perspective!"

kinda vibes with like "gnosis" too

2022-10-13 at 05:33:15: "gnosis" is a word

2022-10-13 at 04:53:03: okay, poll will be up for awhile but my provisional conclusion based on there being nonzero "transformational" response and lots of not-noticing, but simultaneously a fair bit of "annoying"

is that filtering 30-60% is probably good. will ü§Ø a few more people, annoy fewer

2022-10-13 at 04:49:24: I haven't read this but overall I dig @AskYatharth's thoughts a LOT on related topics and if you think this might spark an insight for you then I'd recommend checking it out https://t.co/OhVcGHiOjk

2022-10-13 at 04:45:49: I'm considering doing a small amount of filtering, removing any that feel obvious/boring to me or something like that

I've been tweeting nearly all of them (main exception being eg "2am" if I already did "10am")

"altho" felt kinda dumb when I'd already done "tho"

2022-10-13 at 04:42:28: @deevbrain I was actually just thinking "is this getting a bit much?"

2022-10-13 at 02:06:08: @visakanv honestly there's another half-dozen tweets in that graphic:

1. nerd: I want to know!
2. nerdposting: go on curiosity-driven, exploratory adventures of learning &amp; delight
3. friendly...
4. ...
etc

I might call sermonposting "visionposting" or "grandposting" or something

2022-10-13 at 01:58:12: @visakanv you need three tiny QTable tweets with each of these phrases:

- sensemaking is multiplayer
- people are force-multipliers

tho also parent might themselves have shame around something

2022-10-12 at 03:02:45: @wendell_britt although if you make your boundaries in a self-determining way ("if you X, I will Y") rather than a request ("don't X") then they'll learn quickly that if they don't respect the boundary then you'll respond

https://t.co/iJFeOC4rIw

2022-10-12 at 02:59:55: @wendell_britt ah yeah, sharing those emotions may be relevant for helping someone understand your experience/perspective, but the boundary itself isn't about the feelings

but w porn/booze, *me* not working in the industry doesn't stop people from being harmed, except infinitesimally

2022-10-12 at 02:45:31: @RebeccaMadison_ I'd do my best to help people sort who will be who, to get more of the 1st kind of customers &amp; fewer of the 2nd! &amp; warn ppl so they can take the bet consciously.

Unless the ratio is so bad that it's clearly net negative and unfixable, in which case I'd find the courage to stop.

May you experience a vibrant life on your terms

2022-10-12 at 02:18:42: @Meaningness @drossbucket @SarahAMcManus Ah, very satisfying to figure out where a difference in perspective is and clarifying it!

2022-10-12 at 01:51:55: @TheOceanWithAnO @AskYatharth but anyway, I broadly stand by the modus tollens version too, which doesn't imply you're always doing the right thing (although I've seen a viewpoint from which this is also true in some sense)

thanks for walking me through it!

2022-10-12 at 01:50:04: "envyase" is a word I formed through the usual morpheme+suffix process ("X-ase" means "enzyme that breaks down X") but it's a bit of a stretch

and maybe should be envase? enviase?
https://t.co/giQBUjnsZM

2022-10-12 at 01:49:57: @alt_visa oof, yeah

probably triggering a lot of "not fair" reactions, that then get metabolized into contempt through the usual envyase enzymes

2022-10-12 at 01:30:25: @sharanvkaur @alt_visa almost couldn't remember but then I looked at the original tweet and reconstructed my thought process

`mad scientist`

the result turned out way better than I expected‚ÄîI thought I'd just get someone playing with test-tubes or something ("designed in a lab")

2022-10-12 at 01:28:42: "modus tollens" is two words
"modus ponens" is too

they're Latin but they're part of English now too

2022-10-12 at 01:28:02: @TheOceanWithAnO @AskYatharth oh true, I just denied modus tollens, my bad üòÜ

but I'm having a bit of trouble following why you're saying "we can't negate b". seems to me we can absolutely negate b!

if it's the right thing to do, you're either doing it (¬¨b) or you don't know it's the right thing to do (¬¨a)

2022-10-12 at 01:23:06: @DRMacIver another tidbit:
https://t.co/o5wGvJkXY7

2022-10-12 at 01:22:53: seriously, start the piece of writing with

"So, given that you're also familiar with X, Y, and Z..."

so that even if no such reader exists, you're clearly writing into a frame that takes for granted that whoever is reading it IS familiar with X,Y,Z

2022-10-12 at 01:21:09: @DRMacIver so much of my writing gets blocked based on feeling like I need to summarize other ideas first (mine or others), and it's liberated a lot for me to let go of that and just write for a really small (even hypothetical) audience

2022-10-12 at 01:19:42: @mattgoldenberg you make a good point tho that I didn't address! two non-interacting groups could converge on different stable points

but then if they interacted deeply, they'd evolve their assumptions in order to interoperate with each other, thereby even better approximating the meta-protocol

2022-10-11 at 06:34:03: @TheOceanWithAnO @AskYatharth it actually doesn't imply that no matter how literally you take it

the "if" arrow only goes one way. it says nothing about:
- situations where you don't think you know what the "right thing" is
- situations where you ARE doing what's labelled "right"
https://t.co/07XNtGsOZF

2022-10-11 at 06:28:18: I heard a(n old?) take on "rational" today that I kinda liked, from John Vervaeke

something like: a rational person is someone we can count on to cultivate their character with integrity, over time

some connection with "reason" there, and temporally-interconnected identity

2022-10-11 at 06:22:10: @AskYatharth @m_ashcroft this is a good remix of some of your stuff

2022-10-11 at 06:21:46: @AskYatharth you're usually treating some part of yourself as not-me, in this circumstance, as well

"I keep doing this thing even though I know it doesn't make sense! ü§¨üò´" says a part that isn't the one doing it in the first place. ...it makes some sort of sense to the part that's doing it!

2022-10-11 at 06:14:45: @AskYatharth @abhayance https://t.co/4pD9uLdstS

2022-10-11 at 06:14:38: there's no right way to do it
there's no wrong way to do it
there's simply what works in context and what doesn't work

2022-10-11 at 06:13:07: @AskYatharth @abhayance one weird corollary of the this is that the desire to have there be a right way to do it sometimes amounts to a victim stance, because it allows you to say "but I did it right?! why didn't it work!?"

I mostly point at this re trust-building/comms, but it applies everywhere

2022-10-11 at 06:12:42: "comms" is a word and has been for a century https://t.co/YovDF9YfJW

2022-10-11 at 06:10:47: @AskYatharth @abhayance yeah I mean of course
obviously
PCT &amp; Coherence both make this abundantly clear
also eventually "right thing" kind of dissolves, at least in the way it was previously conceived

"right thing" is usually still steering to please the parent/teacher or otherwise avoid punishment

2022-10-11 at 06:06:09: @alt_visa ohhh, so it's the fact that you were raised with no concept of any relation to the thing, therefore you don't act in any ways, even subtle, that would give off signs? fascinating

2022-10-11 at 05:59:31: @alt_visa ah yeah, wow. trevor noah vibes for sure

what makes it so illegible? is it usually legible via name?

2022-10-11 at 05:57:11: @made_in_cosmos @interintellect_ could try it. I want to start with much simpler stuff, and I think preferably stuff that isn't tinged with the idea that perspective-taking is something one *should* do, which shows up a bunch around gender

2022-10-11 at 05:53:30: @DharmaRational @xuenay @Meaningness @JakeOrthwein @drossbucket @SarahAMcManus I made a new place to discuss that, since it seems like its own centerpoint as a topic and I wanted to tag the PCT folks in, who don't necessarily have all the context for *this* convo

2022-10-11 at 05:52:17: PCT folks (@EvadeHullu, @warrenmansell, @IAPCT)
where are places where PCT makes different predictions from the latest post-behaviorism reinforcement learning models? https://t.co/1Hc5w9Np0j

2022-10-11 at 05:51:45: @alt_visa I'm... curious what people holding this worldview think about people who have nothing to do with the whole system in the first place (eg me). where do they fit? the worldview feels a bit pre-international or something

pre-contact-with-other-worldviews, maybe. kegan 3, not 4

2022-10-11 at 05:46:41: @mattgoldenberg but it does need to be sufficiently meta!
and most introductions to the meta-norms are first going to be learned as object or meta-1, rather than fully recursively self-rederivingly üîÑ

based on üëá I believe @Morphenius is tackling this part of the puzzle!
https://t.co/eamaIQSLP2

2022-10-11 at 05:44:55: (self-)"rederivingly" is a word

this is one of my absurder constructions, but I like it a lot

2022-10-11 at 05:43:30: @mattgoldenberg I have some half-sketches of an existence proof of there being a single convergent meta-protocol, but there's a good chance it wouldn't turn out to be adequately rigorous if I fleshed it out

it does seem that way to me though, having stared at it a fuckton!

2022-10-11 at 05:41:56: @mattgoldenberg yup, which is why Jordan &amp; I call this the meta-protocol. it is always ever fully meta and incomplete

"how to agree on the agreement process" reminds me of my thread of koans that are all attempting to jolt people into seeing the meta-protocol puzzle:
https://t.co/7odE3a7jsq

2022-10-11 at 05:40:04: @alt_visa oh interesting, right, so it's very umm... people are very subject to it, it's just taken for granted that that's how things (well, people) are

2022-10-11 at 05:18:28: @DougTataryn @smallkewlhuman @Chaucer2616 @RichDecibels Doug you said in Toronto that you'd done some preliminary studies that could predict mental illness or mood or something from patterns of muscle tension or something like that... any docs on that? it seems like it'd be fascinating to follow up on!

2022-10-11 at 05:17:33: @FluidityAudio @everytstudies ah yeah maybe. like Chloe there is sort of just linking "non-naive" and "trust" without actually accounting for why "non-naive" is there

intriguing that it uses the same word as the cat couplings post: "naive"

2022-10-11 at 05:15:31: @gTerton ah cool! "TA" means something like "being such"?

2022-10-11 at 05:12:17: @Meaningness @drossbucket @SarahAMcManus you can't ever find the goals in an absolute or permanent sense

there are intrinsic reference levels, eg staying fed, watered, right temperature, etc

but the goal hierarchy is an evolutionary process, and at the top is your paradigm(s), not static but evolving

2022-10-11 at 05:08:51: @Meaningness @drossbucket @SarahAMcManus PCT addresses this ‚Üí in this case one or both of these happened:
- the goal was in conflict with some other goal, which put the brakes on and stopped it from being achieved (well-known in therapy)
- the goal was reorganized in service of some higher-level goal (improv)

2022-10-11 at 05:05:22: @Meaningness @drossbucket @SarahAMcManus overall I see evolutionary approaches to cognition &amp; motivation (like PCT) as a potential partial solution to the puzzle of figuring out in what sense goals/values exist since they're clearly in some sense part of *gestures around* even if they aren't what we think they are

2022-10-11 at 05:04:21: @Meaningness @drossbucket @SarahAMcManus I do agree that most attempts to do AI safety ARE confused about "goals" in precisely the way that you say though!

but yeah, my tweets above are why I responded like this to your top-level tweet:
https://t.co/Cc3lWoCTzF

2022-10-11 at 05:00:31: @Meaningness @drossbucket @SarahAMcManus now, you might *describe* the goal in words, just as you might describe a perception you're perceiving in the present in words

but the words are always just a pointer

2022-10-11 at 04:58:46: @Meaningness @drossbucket @SarahAMcManus oh! PCT has a concept of goal that is not a proposition any more than a perception is a proposition (in fact, PCT's goals are basically the same type, ontologically, as perceptions!)

a PCT-style goal is a perception that your behavior attempts to bring about.

2022-10-11 at 04:58:28: "ontologically" is a word

2022-10-11 at 03:46:41: @visakanv this is related to this paradox/koan üëá and to how at a global scale we need something like John Bunzl's SimPol (Simultaneous Policy) which is what NNTD would be if it were for geopolitics‚Äîit solves the "global markets, no global governance" problem

2022-10-11 at 03:43:38: @visakanv mostly just gonna say my usual thing which is to focus on nurturing people's self-trust and encouraging them to trust what they trust and distrust what they distrust, and respect others' doing so

if people can dialogue from there, they don't need a leader/arbiter!

2022-10-11 at 02:42:50: Dawkins' "blind watchmaker" analogy for evolution being purposeless is AWFUL 3 times over:
1. "blind" doesn't mean "purposeless"; any watchmaker is purposeful
2. the watch WAS designed, so assuming it was designed is correct!
3. design IS evolutionary!! #EverythingIsARemix https://t.co/cJfOQNYlWH

2022-10-11 at 02:11:35: but also, in terms of profit, I PAY FOR YOUTUBE. you can't make more money by selling me more ads!

and I would pay several times more if you built a version that didn't just not have ads but actually was built with me in mind as a customer

2022-10-11 at 02:11:35: like I kinda get if for profit reasons you're required to feed us shit that's not what we looked for. it's slimy and evil but sure, you've got incentives

but please hide an ACTUAL "relevance" sort under filters, and call the default one "default" or something

2022-10-11 at 02:11:34: meanwhile it showed THIS üëá video, which... has 1.1M views &amp; doesn't mention ANY of the keywords I searched for.

you're sorting by "relevance"? BULLSHIT. seriously is there a product designer at YT willing to have some integrity and rename the sort algo?
https://t.co/Q1pxpMbsQx

2022-10-11 at 02:11:34: for youtube in particular, I think that the "exploring" mode should maaaaaybe favor popular videos over closer matches

it claims it's already sorting by relevance ü§®
oh yeah? THIS üëá is a more relevant result? no "malcolm" here. y u think I use that term?
https://t.co/lMlw7456F6

2022-10-11 at 02:11:34: it would benefit search engines a lot to be able to easily toggle modes between
- "I'm exploring, show me what you got"
- "I'm looking for something in particular I remember seeing"

https://t.co/EsFutl0e0l

2022-10-09 at 19:46:56: in a healthy conflict-resolution context it's very important for someone who wronged someone else to be able to convey their own perspective on the whole situation and be heard about it, though usually AFTER proving they see what it was liked for the person they hurt

2022-10-09 at 19:46:55: "apology" originally meant "defense, justification"

it was a move of accepting that you'd wronged the person but explaining why it wasn't really so bad or why you had no other option https://t.co/ADrrodHyYD

2022-10-09 at 19:40:13: @visakanv maybe people sorta think everyone is running a grift, so they see honest people as just more successfully hiding it, therefore less trustworthy

tho if you were really consistent about this distrust you'd notice that nothing stops an apologizer from running grift #2

2022-10-09 at 19:39:32: "sus" is a mildly sus word but it's a word

2022-10-09 at 19:38:17: "apologizer" is a word

(you might think it'd be "apologist" but that has different vibes)

2022-10-09 at 19:37:09: "grift" is a word

2022-10-07 at 01:15:16: @visakanv my gloss of how to do this in a way that feels like fun rather than drudgery is "find the places where there's an obvious interesting reply you can make that feels exciting to make" (even if it involves stretching to explain something anew)

2022-10-04 at 05:15:44: @RobertHaisfield @Meaningness @JakeOrthwein @drossbucket @SarahAMcManus another way to put all of this is that capital-B Behaviorism was a niche theory that lasted less than a century, but it was a codification of some much older underlying assumptions about how motivation works, that are still with us, and PCT is questioning these

2022-10-04 at 05:14:48: @RobertHaisfield @Meaningness @JakeOrthwein @drossbucket @SarahAMcManus and even years after first getting mindblown by PCT I found myself talking in terms of "not wanting to reinforce something" and realized upon closer inspection that this pointed at an error/confusion in my thinking

2022-10-04 at 05:10:59: "mindblown" is a word if "windswept" is a word, which it is

2022-10-04 at 05:09:08: @RobertHaisfield @Meaningness @JakeOrthwein @drossbucket @SarahAMcManus true, *but* the PCT view is essentially that the whole concept of "reinforcement" is backwards

much the same sort of backwards as "phlogiston"

thus the use of the notion of "reinforcement learning" has behaviorism baked into the frame

2022-10-04 at 05:05:14: "phlogiston" is a word even tho phlogiston is not a thing

2022-10-04 at 04:56:56: @Meaningness @JakeOrthwein @drossbucket @SarahAMcManus fwiw, behaviorism is clearly *also* onto something‚Äîclicker training clearly works really well to train skills &amp; habits, as long as the target behaviors don't create conflicts with other needs / control systems!

https://t.co/TRzTRF1QAS

2022-10-04 at 04:51:52: @Meaningness @JakeOrthwein @drossbucket @SarahAMcManus "no one has taken behaviorism seriously since 1952" is a major citation needed üòÜ

and even if true in some sense, a lot of people still think in ways that imply behaviorist paradigms!

CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) is based on behaviorism and widely practiced today

2022-10-04 at 04:42:51: @kalinh ahhh, yes, if you're actually strictly picking two (vs a linear combination) then the arrows should point towards the corners

tho then the arrowheads would be faded out. I'm using the arrows to highlight the ~axes

2022-10-04 at 04:38:16: @Meaningness @JakeOrthwein @drossbucket @SarahAMcManus So the PCT folks have some specific demos you can play with, that seem to me extremely conclusive that their model is onto *something*. Many are geared towards rejecting behaviorist models in particular.

https://t.co/nYMs13EZQV

2022-10-04 at 04:33:59: @Meaningness @drossbucket @SarahAMcManus I'd be interested in knowing roughly what you think underlies human motivation, neurologically or on whatever other level of abstraction.

Maybe it dovetails with PCT, maybe it'll be subtly behaviorist and then I'll be able to apply the PCT critique to it, maybe something else!

2022-10-04 at 04:32:25: @Meaningness @drossbucket @SarahAMcManus PCT emerged in part as a critique of behaviorism, and frankly I think part of why it remains limitedly popular is that it's still ambiently oriented towards explaining how confused behaviorism is, and still has a kind of underdog vibe about the whole thing.

2022-10-04 at 04:31:51: "ambiently" is a word

2022-10-04 at 04:29:40: "limitedly" is a word

2022-10-04 at 04:28:42: @Meaningness @drossbucket @SarahAMcManus They're vague because compressed into a tweet, but they seem quite clear/precise in the theory!

Powers (original author of PCT) is in my experience fairly balanced about having lots of open questions but having some sense that his model is better than anything that came before

2022-10-04 at 04:10:48: @JakeOrthwein @Meaningness @drossbucket @SarahAMcManus Jake when you say you're "also confused", are you saying "like David, I also think PP/PCT doesn't make sense" or saying "like Malcolm, I also am confused that David thinks PP/PCT doesn't makes sense"?

2022-10-04 at 04:07:52: @Meaningness @drossbucket @SarahAMcManus as one next step, I'm curious if you agree/disagree with these claims (including 6,7,8 not in below tweet). to me they seem true as investigated phenomenologically

and if you agree, what do you think a better source would be

and if you disagree, why?
https://t.co/sSRzCXieuj

2022-10-04 at 04:07:26: "phenomenologically" is a word

already good:
‚ÄÉ"phenomenon"
‚ÄÉ"phenomenology"
‚ÄÉ"phenomenological"

surely another suffix is fine üòõ

2022-10-04 at 04:03:50: @Meaningness @drossbucket @SarahAMcManus cool. appreciating the disclaimer haha. indeed, what I was asking about was what they looked like to you from a distance, and you've conveyed that to me!

2022-10-03 at 20:51:24: @EyalShay2 although interesting, after ep12 he posted this video of just himself, which has 1.4M views (idk how many were back then or more recently)

so arguably he earned a bit of his attention via stuff like that too, idk
https://t.co/PV7ot8uISc

2022-10-03 at 20:49:26: @EyalShay2 but let's face it, he also had Elon Musk on for episode 18, and you don't get that through any amount of being a good interviewer.

2022-10-03 at 20:46:51: @EyalShay2 and he'd also posted some famous people guest lectures at MIT, which have 100k+ views

thus probably he had 100s or 1000s of subs before ep1

https://t.co/7M8uZtfv1h

2022-10-03 at 20:44:44: @EyalShay2 also when I sorted his youtube from oldest to newest, I discovered that before he started those interviews, he'd posted 60+ videos, many of which were "quick insights": short edits of others' quotes

the sort of thing that goes decently viral

or maybe in other words you need to have at 100% total of crapness, expensiveness, and slowness

2022-10-03 at 20:19:13: @robertskmiles wait no these are isomorphic I think! the soil one is just way easier to put markings on...

2022-10-03 at 20:16:25: @robertskmiles ah, yeah, this is the way!

2022-10-03 at 19:18:17: wow, people are so bad at visualizing stuff

the correct way to visualize the "good, fast, cheap; pick 3" in a triangle is to put the 3 items on the *edges*, and then each corner represents the extreme absence of the opposite edge, and you can represent every other possibility https://t.co/hdyRZDHxqM

(and dynamically self-correcting, not back to a static thing but towards the thing it most deeply wants to be. vid on this üëá)

2022-10-02 at 03:55:44: (from a DM)
&gt; If there were some beacon of trust people could radiate and be assured of accurate reception, that couldn't be copied... that last part would be an issue

that's the reason I talk about trust-DANCING. you can't simply BE trustworthy, it's a whole interactive process

You can plant any one of those
Keep planting to find out which one grows
It's a secret no one knows

2022-10-02 at 03:29:10: So hold on the ones who really care
In the end they'll be the only ones there
And when you get old and start losing your hair
Tell me who will still care
Can you tell me who will still care?

2022-10-02 at 03:29:09: You have so many relationships in this life
Only one or two will last
You go through all the pain and strife

let's call the whole thing off

2022-09-28 at 17:15:19: By "strict pomos" I mean, first of all, not checking any random stuff during a pomo, but 2ndly, not doing OTHER USEFUL WORK during a pomo. Only working on the single thing I set out to work on.

Have a good idea? Put it on the list and do it later (maybe). Don't divert momentum!

2022-09-28 at 17:15:19: I'm falling back in love with strict pomodoros, and I'm enjoying the feel of putting other intentions at the bottom of my list if those urges/ideas arise.

This is particularly powerful in Complice, where those new items DO stick around for a couple days but NOT forever!

2022-09-28 at 17:08:34: applies on other scales too
years ago I set out to make a drip newsletter, and got stuck
when I introspected I realized I'd allocated enough time to make a shit version, and that I didn't WANT to make a shit newsletter
but that I ALSO didn't want to spend more time

they've all been evolving the whole time. newer isn't better. but! some overall shapes had others as dependencies and not vice versa

2022-09-28 at 03:07:13: some of these are questionable, actually!

‚Ü≥ false if by "evolution" you mean something specifically biological
‚Ü≥ true if you mean "the process by which there tend to be more of the sorts of things that make more of themselves

2022-09-27 at 00:23:47: the "go outside" mostly functions to make the transition out of frog-mode much more obvious and harder to do mindlessly

2022-09-26 at 22:29:22: whoa fascinating. I used to be part of a group that talked about "couple bubbles" as an obstacle to larger group coherence

and indeed, couples can often generate a kind of multi-person inward mindset, unable to notice the world outside

but yeah, healthy versions too https://t.co/WcIjnZMTx1

2022-09-26 at 22:27:15: @reasonisfun yup! don't take relational/psych advice from people less happy than you. don't adopt their worldviews.

2022-09-26 at 21:42:51: @ricvolpe @alicemazzy @BlackForestBoi @visakanv right, yeah. I feel like it could use:
- alerts of some kind (email, sms, twitter DM?)
- some ping like "hey, we don't know where you are rn!"

those would both increase value and increase activity. suspect something like that is needed to have sufficient usage

2022-09-26 at 21:40:47: fun fact:
the original tweet said "other people" but letting *yourself* make your own mistakes is *also* a profound form of self-respect and creates tons more space for thorough learning

2022-09-26 at 21:40:46: and re "letting people have their actual understandings (even when they're misunderstanding you)"

this isn't about allowing them to persist in misunderstanding you. it's about accepting that, for the time being... they are! that's reality. gotta start there to resolve it.

2022-09-26 at 21:40:46: notice that in order to do that you have to really slow down and open up a dialogue

you can't do that in the flinchy reacty mode

and if the fire is very imminent, maybe there isn't time for that. this does happen but is way rarer than we usually believe.

2022-09-26 at 21:40:45: or explain to them what you understand and let them decide if they're willing to bear those impacts!

but then if they seem to be, notice if you suddenly grasp because you're not, and own that as yours. it's real, it matters. (tho they may choose to disregard it)

2022-09-26 at 21:40:45: and in those situations, it's important to be clear that *you're* the one not willing to bear the potential impacts of their learning process (as you perceive it)

https://t.co/Cn7kRCTrjK

2022-09-26 at 21:40:45: trying to prevent someone else from making their own mistake has a cost

*sometimes* the cost is worth it; if you don't intervene, they'll burn the house down, or cause some smaller destruction to your or their property (or bodies)

but there's still a cost!

2022-09-26 at 21:40:44: I'm mostly talking about an immediate triggery flinchy response here, not longer slower dynamics, though it does apply there too

very common when people are less differentiated:
- parents correcting children
- husbands/wives correcting each other
- mentor/guru correcting trainee

2022-09-26 at 21:40:44: the sense of "I would never make that mistake in the first place" leads to not just correcting but trying to rushedly unmake the mistake

https://t.co/BgaedkeTyx

2022-09-26 at 21:40:43: letting people have their actual understandings (even when they're misunderstanding you)

letting people try an approach (even if you know/think it won't work)

letting people have their triggers &amp; neuroses (even if they make no sense to you)

= all forms of acceptance &amp; respect

2022-09-26 at 21:40:43: the main cause of failing to do this afaict is having an overzealous self-other boundary that includes the other person and then says "I would never make a mistake like that!" and then tries to correct their behavior with our own principle

bruh, they're not you!

I am trying to solve failed communication IN THE GENERAL CASE https://t.co/LCq3pqpPyc

2022-09-26 at 04:08:38: @sashintweets @visakanv so maybe part of me wants X, and doesn't care about Y
and pursuing X has been reducing Y
so she thinks "you want not-Y"
but actually, that part would honestly say:
- I want X
- I don't want Y, per se
- I also don't WANT not-Y

and then another part can just say:
- I want Y

2022-09-26 at 04:04:43: @sashintweets @visakanv also note the difference between "I don't want" and "I want not"‚Äîthe part of me whose job it is to remind me to empty a full bladder doesn't want anyone to have friends! it simply doesn't care about such things.

https://t.co/hhj72Myd51

2022-09-26 at 04:03:13: @sashintweets @visakanv in fact, it could be true both that "I want you to have friends" and that "I don't want you to have friends" from two different parts of me

but naming the former at least says "I'm presenting part of me that's allied with you" even if some other part dissents

2022-09-26 at 04:01:26: @sashintweets @visakanv mmm, good point

hadn't consciously thought about that, but yeah. contradicting the dream mashup without actually naming what it says or even quite arguing with it.

2022-09-26 at 03:59:29: @justavagrant_ I came up with a new pithy articulation of this:

https://t.co/74OjC5YI5o

2022-09-26 at 03:56:38: Exercise for the reader: explain how both of these forms of trust are secretly this üëá

https://t.co/H34BQsPNTf

2022-09-26 at 03:56:37: Voice isn't about quantity of communication but quality. It's about getting yourself and others heard when that's what matters.

https://t.co/74OjC5ZfUW

2022-09-26 at 03:56:37: Likewise, internally to a group, if syncing isn't happening adequately, it's (usually) not enough to declare "this is a safe space for all viewpoints" and expect people to suddenly start revealing things, if they fear blame or judgement. That trust has to be built.

2022-09-26 at 03:56:36: Also some ongoing communication is still required to make sure teams are on the same page, eg that one team isn't using metric units and the other imperial.

Otherwise you're trusting but naively so. Gotta ensure the interface is adequate.
https://t.co/nKRW91j0eX

2022-09-26 at 03:56:36: Bezos, in this frame, was saying it was not enough exit trust. But he doesn't just say "do it"‚Äî"FIGURE OUT a way for teams to communicate less"

ie some communication may be required in the meantime, to establish the boundary of where one team's scope ends and the other's begins.

2022-09-26 at 03:56:36: Anyway! The implications of these two kinds of trust required for healthy teams is that if you're having trouble coordinating closely, either of these might be a leverage point.

2022-09-26 at 03:56:36: Upwards in scale, an organization comprised of many teams still does need to have adequate voice between those teams, even if Bezos is right that the total volume should be less. And the org needs exit trust‚Äîfor it &amp; its partners to be not meddling in each other.

2022-09-26 at 03:56:35: Exit &amp; Voice Trust apply on different fractal scales, too. Within a small close team, people still need to give each other autonomy as individuals to do their respective jobs (exit). And within a person, we need to learn to listen &amp; integrate our different voices/views.

2022-09-26 at 03:56:35: Voice Trust is what maintains the inner health of the group. People need to feel grounded in their own perspectives &amp; knowings in order to be able to really hear and understand others.

2022-09-26 at 03:56:35: Voice Trust is the trust required for a person or group (with adequate autonomy from the outside world) to internally get the perspectives of its various people or parts in sync and settle on a course of action that will be carried out.

2022-09-26 at 03:56:34: Exit Trust creates the outer boundary of the people working together closely &amp; organically.

It's recursive: Group A needs to trust Group B in order for B to have autonomy to work closely &amp; organically, and B needs to trust that A trusts B.

2022-09-26 at 03:56:34: Exit Trust is the trust required to grant autonomy to other agents, so they don't have to waste time/effort/attention/sanity asking for permission for things.

https://t.co/6Cm7fqYlLZ

2022-09-26 at 03:56:33: In order to get people working in close, organic way, afaict you need two kinds of trust.

This uhhh vaguely maps onto the "exit, voice" thing so I'm gonna steal those terms and call them exit trust and voice trust.

2022-09-26 at 03:56:33: Then the Q is how to get back in sync.

@nosilverv adds:
&gt; And no explicit deliberation isn‚Äôt the only way to get sync
&gt; Literally do things together, let your bodies communicate, the bandwidth is so much higher

ie what Bezos is saying:
&gt; working together in a close, organic way

2022-09-26 at 03:56:33: Communication, when it is occurring, needs to work. But the *need* for communication (ie explicit coordination) especially lots of it, is a sign that you're out of sync!

https://t.co/CKl3RS7pvH

2022-09-26 at 03:56:32: I'm kind of a communication guy, but I actually agree.

&gt; Communication is a sign of dysfunction. It means people aren't working together in a close, organic way. We should be trying to figure out a way for teams to communicate less with each other, not more.

Thread to explore: https://t.co/ycviAX3x4w

2022-09-26 at 03:50:34: Then when listening, keep this in mind:

Just because someone else's assumption/generalization contradicts yours, doesn't negate the reality of whatever happened that gave each of you those learnings!
https://t.co/4QuBX6V1Kf

2022-09-26 at 03:50:33: Hearing yourself thoroughly enough to hear someone else with different deep assumptions may require self-validating your own experience all the way back to some life experience from years ago!

https://t.co/dRgb18L1D3

3 step solution:

if we assume that's important, we might try to find another word/term from the metaphor, that's also less ambiguous

"what if I didn't snack now?"

2022-09-24 at 21:02:07: @CXGonzalez brushing aside things that annoy them or turn them off. 

it's possible to acknowledge those things and feel what you feel about them, without immediately going "oh no is this a dealbreaker?!" but while also not going "but this is fine definitely not a dealbreaker"

2022-09-24 at 20:59:56: @made_in_cosmos my house growing up had a spare bed in a large section of ~hallway, where people (mostly my uncle) would stay when visiting. we also had a pull-out sofa.

(this in a small town‚Äîit was a 4-story house on an acre property, that cost maybe what a 2br condo would cost in a city)

2022-09-24 at 20:55:50: @made_in_cosmos when my grandparents built a new house outside town (they were about 60 at the time) it was just the two of them living there but they built in 2 guest rooms for visiting kids &amp; grandkids &amp; so on

so indeed, not under 50, but a good example of intentionally-built not moved-out-of

2022-09-24 at 02:13:50: @jessicamalonso @relic_radiation @HeidiPriebe1 yeah ultimately no blame is necessary at all, the question is just how do we reparent ourselves and our friends, and how do we parent the next generation better?

could maybe host it as an @interintellect_ salon

2022-09-24 at 01:35:21: a link to some of my earlier speculation on this topic, though I don't go into much depth there:

https://t.co/Fc6l0s76xE

2022-09-24 at 01:35:20: overall this offramps thing seems like it could comprise a whole sub-department of the Memetic Mediation Division of the Metamodern Post-propaganda Project

2022-09-24 at 01:35:20: it could be that some of the people someone might be trying to influence don't actually have a deep take on the situation, they just have a bit of rhetoric that resonates with some aspect of their experience, and are thus easily given a new one

but
https://t.co/7qCchofxGR

2022-09-24 at 01:35:19: if you actually understand someone's actual experience &amp; values, you can actually engage with them and help them figure out what's actually good for them, which is a very different kind of move

2022-09-24 at 01:35:19: these are obviously going to be a lot less opinionated towards a lateral viewpoint than the permission structure versions

eg for vax might say something more honest like "yeah, there are risks. I eventually decided it was worth it, but it's a tough call"
https://t.co/VhioU5axbq

2022-09-24 at 01:35:18: I've been thinking that we could probably use bespoke offramps for cults, but it seemed obvious to me that they'd need to be written by people who'd left those exact cults, articulating new views that actually transcend &amp; include the old views, not just pay lip service https://t.co/hoDaDqR4Xf

2022-09-23 at 23:21:14: @kcorazo "non-coercive" is not a very popular phrase in wider culture, but you might have some success looking for "integral leadership" or "blame free culture" or systems thinking books like the Fifth Discipline

https://t.co/0y7Hgpwz2A

2022-09-23 at 23:16:54: @kcorazo This article explores my Non-Naive Trust Dancing framework (which is a framework for how to do non-coercive relating on all scales) in the context of someone who is a manager at an organization:

https://t.co/r0YIOHv7Tl

2022-09-23 at 23:02:28: Maybe by the time that you make your way here, I'll be gone
This game might be over, though the infinite music plays on
I know who you are, though I can't‚ÄîI can't always see
How to make space for what's real, both for you and for me
‚ô´
https://t.co/ROVohyVifG

2022-09-23 at 23:02:28: I've seen you in love and you've seen me see that look in your eyes
We've seen things together that made us think we were so wise
What does it mean, for how we want to organize our lives?
What does it tell us, about our most intimate drives?
‚ô´
https://t.co/ROVohyUKq8

2022-09-23 at 23:02:27: I want love that opens my eyes, not a love that is blind
Love that alters, not falters, to embrace each alteration it finds
I want love that learns... how to love better in time
Love that's up for and down for each pass of this mountain climb
‚ô´
https://t.co/ROVohyUKq8

2022-09-23 at 23:02:27: I'm not just waiting, I'm actively seeking to find
A way to untangle this seemingly impossible bind
It's more of a dance, not a question of how to make love stay
So whether fast or slow, let's go where we can go, today
‚ô´
https://t.co/ROVohyUKq8

2022-09-23 at 23:02:26: What have we gotten ourselves and each other into?
It's hard to explain it, but it's something we just can't not do
How did we get here? What is this place that we're in?
Is there a boundary? Where does it end and begin?
‚ô´
https://t.co/ROVohyUKq8

2022-09-23 at 22:55:16: I will be in love
I will be right here in love
So when you are also in love
I will be in love with you

2022-09-08 at 14:13:23: @visakanv I can feel self-generated safety since I know I have my own back. This is relatively new, since ~2y ago when I had the Non-Naive Trust Dance insight and realized that self-trust is one of the most important things.

2022-09-08 at 07:07:53: "ultimator" is a word

2022-09-08 at 04:43:28: just met an expat from Nepal and I told him 20% of my clothes that aren't just t-shirts are from Nepal, and he was like "I don't even have that much Nepalese clothing anymore" and described how people thought he was a hippie when he first moved to the US

2022-09-05 at 18:47:17: @Meaningness @drossbucket @SarahAMcManus They seem to be nearly isomorphic, though the framing of control systems seems to be way saner than the other framing, as Scott outlines here. PP feels inside out or backwards to me.

2022-09-05 at 04:59:23: @the_wilderless meanwhile there's also the level of abstraction that's like "murder" or "accident" or "war" or "disease" or "old age" or "wild animal" or "suicide/selfharm" (or "poison" tho that would also arguably always either be a subcase of murder or accident or suicide)

2022-09-05 at 04:57:36: "subcase" is a word

2022-09-05 at 04:55:45: @the_wilderless if you're looking not at the external "what happened" but the internal "how did the body stop working" then eg gun deaths are usually bleeding or infection

so maybe only weird shit like "radiation exposure" counts as new. tho I guess you couldn't explode someone 1000ya either

2022-09-05 at 04:53:50: @the_wilderless sort of depends on the level of abstraction you describe it on I guess

2022-09-05 at 03:19:17: @Meaningness @SarahAMcManus Maybe you're saying "that's where all the juice is though" and I'm willing to concede that a lot of the juice is there but that there's a lot you can do without it
- eg my original claim (that "goals" don't require mentalist metaphysics)
- eg modelling control system conflict

2022-09-05 at 03:17:33: @Meaningness @SarahAMcManus From my perspective, insofar as thought &amp; behavior seem to function like a hierarchical network of control systems (substantially but not 100%) this *implies* the existence of an adequate neural-system-that-can-parse-abstract-quantities ...which doesn't mean we know what that is!

2022-09-05 at 03:13:57: @Meaningness @SarahAMcManus Okay I feel kind of annoyed here because you're the one who brought in Kalman filters and then you're complaining about people who try to compare things to Kalman filters! Idgaf about Kalman filters.

2022-09-05 at 03:09:25: @Meaningness @SarahAMcManus Like "ah I want to explain this in more detail but also I want to stay brief" ‚Äî that seems like two reference conditions that can both be more or less satisfied. And the same principles for resolving conflict apply: go up a level, let go of one half, find a win-win, etc

2022-09-05 at 03:06:04: @Meaningness @SarahAMcManus I don't see why that follows! Lots of human behaviour at these abstract levels seems also well-described by something like control system (conflict), and that doesn't depend on any particular representational scheme or even per se continuousness vs discreteness.

2022-09-05 at 02:38:05: @Meaningness @SarahAMcManus It seems to me like perceptual control theory could still be essentially correct even above the motor levels, while it's also somehow true that something WAY fancier &amp; more loopy than Kalman filters is needed to make higher order control systems work (eg "make enough money")

2022-09-05 at 02:36:36: @Meaningness @SarahAMcManus I'm just gonna ask a dumb question here: are all control systems Kalman filters? Seems like obviously no: a mercury thermostat is just a boolean on/off trigger.

So is Kalman filters pointing at "control systems that do averaging over time?" (fancier than PID controllers I guess)

2022-09-05 at 02:30:49: @Meaningness @SarahAMcManus Thanks in part to you, I get how Bayesianism is confused because of ontological issues where it presupposes a frame (even if on some tiny scale neurons do Bayes, and within frame Bayes works)

Are you saying the Kalman confusion is essentially the same issue?

2022-09-05 at 02:29:53: @Meaningness @SarahAMcManus So I'm seeing a lot of snark about Kalman filters, but nothing that helps me understand how they're confused.

Is your main critique not that Kalman filters don't work (it seems they're used successfully in industry?) but that they're insufficient to explain the whole thing?

2022-09-05 at 02:20:57: @Meaningness @SarahAMcManus 6b. "isn't working well" is defined in terms of either higher-level (relatively more abstract goals) or intrinsic reference levels like thirst, hunger, temperature, ~sex, ~dignity

https://t.co/d3BXtYbRcw

2022-09-05 at 02:16:26: @Meaningness @SarahAMcManus 8. Given all this, humans can in general carry out complex tasks without excessive planning of the kind that leads to the "alternation of fantasy and surprise", because the higher level goals allow lower level ones to improvise

(=me trying to frame re your Pengi model/paper)

This rabbit hole can take you to a couple weird places that I'm not gonna articulate in public today üòÖ

2022-09-05 at 01:30:45: @Meaningness I like this angle on it.

Tho the claim that "goals" are purely mentalist metaphysics seems absurd from a cybernetic point of view (eg Perceptual Control Theory).

Systems have reference conditions for perceptions/measurements of world states, and do stuff to close those gaps.

2022-09-05 at 01:25:03: @nat_sharpe_ @AltYatharth Yes tho also... my impression* is that there is a sense in which infants simply *do* trust their parents by default, and this is adaptive. Which doesn't mean parents deserve it!

Were the Iroquois an early dynamic society with rational memes? (at least in a few dimensions) https://t.co/gJULvjbhTo

2022-09-03 at 02:12:49: One approach to unifying them is "no, they were more diverse than we've mostly imagined (some lavish, some ascetic, some egalitarian, some with chattel slavery) but they weren't consciously iterating."

2022-09-03 at 02:12:49: In which a case is made that early humans somewhat consciously tried a diverse range of cultural styles, that iterated.

2022-09-01 at 15:59:56: @xuenay hmm. one response would be that if you want your group to be symmetrical (which a parent-child relationship isn't) then there ISN'T a special individual

even if there's a trusted individual who's skilled at mediating, who decides when they have a conflict of interest?

2022-09-01 at 15:56:02: @xuenay I would agree that this analogy works okay and is useful! and that's part of why I'm saying it _doesn't_ work fully

there's a different way more magical thing that happens when GroupSelf emerges, that's not just "we can mediate this conflict" but new patterns of attention &amp; flow

2022-09-01 at 15:52:15: @xuenay although reflecting on this, it's sort of irrelevant to my point

I'm saying merely being in a mode that's internally wholeness-oriented doesn't mean being able to be upwardly wholeness-oriented; other unknowns lurk in the other ppl, that your Self may not know how to account for

2022-09-01 at 15:50:24: @xuenay hmmm
it is, but something feels different somehow about how it's all in one mind
like feels different internally to me, at least
idk if I actually have a different declarative model about it as well
but yeah good point

2022-09-01 at 05:37:14: @_ali_taylor hi I wrote u a thread:
https://t.co/sF6DQUEBNr

2022-09-01 at 05:21:49: this whole thread feels like a new edge of articulation of my main project, that's building on a few other new pieces that clicked into clarity for me while doing a bunch of unpublished writing &amp; reflecting the last month

would love to hear what inspires you, or critiques!

2022-09-01 at 05:21:48: I have once or twice managed to speak to two parts in someone that were at odds, in the same breath (tho addressing them separately) and have them both feel welcomed, and it was quite powerful

but this is not always going to be possible in practice

2022-09-01 at 05:21:47: another part of the puzzle here is that people might have their own parts active that are busy rejecting what their other parts are seeing...

...which will make it hard for them to feel welcomed by any GroupSelf

...which implies it's very hard to HAVE GroupSelf in such a scene

2022-09-01 at 05:21:47: it seems to me that GroupSelf-ness can be enhanced by learning to *hear* what others are saying in ways that still leave space for your own perspective, even if it's phrased it ways that seem to deny your perspective

ideally with minimal distortion of *their* perspective https://t.co/MTXuPKcTJw

2022-09-01 at 05:21:45: so perhaps we might say "iff GroupSelf is speaking, everyone in the group will feel space for their own perspective in what GroupSelf is saying"

verbal practices (eg NVC) can help create this, but the question is whether it's working, not whether you're using the right language

2022-09-01 at 05:21:44: note that your own subjective truths are largely represented as generalizations, and *as generalizations* they are busy implying falsehoods

but underneath is an experience, that can be interpreted better and better!
https://t.co/4QuBX7cCBN

2022-09-01 at 05:21:43: I've been playing around with the idea that "trust = subjective truth" ie "trust = truth in first person"

thus: we distrust others' perspectives when they seem to negate what we ourselves know to be true

we've all got a lot of practice self-negating
https://t.co/0wg9qtu7z6

2022-09-01 at 05:21:43: but perhaps instead the thing to track is simply whether the perspective speaking generates distrust in you/others

and then respect when that happens!
https://t.co/Mc0vFxe53G

2022-09-01 at 05:21:42: now, in general when the GroupSelf speaks it will be speaking out of a single individual's mouth at a time

how does one tell the difference between that and the individual speaking, in oneself and others?
I have the sense that this is learnable.....

2022-09-01 at 05:21:41: and even if a person is inhabiting Self themselves, they still can't play the role of GroupSelf because they don't have access to others' perspectives in the way they have access to their own

and people have different trust-functions
https://t.co/W0NyiXclqn

2022-09-01 at 05:21:41: note ofc that in IFS, sometimes the Self still has some other part blended with it or claiming to be it (a therapizer part, a fixy part.,) in which cases the other parts will appropriately not trust this false Self

2022-09-01 at 05:21:40: a person can't be IFS Self for a group, because by definition the Self is trustable by all the parts, and there's no person who is fully trustable by all the other people in the group

just as Self is an emergent mode, not a part
GroupSelf is an emergent mode, not a person

2022-09-01 at 05:14:34: "-ness" is a word

2022-09-01 at 04:55:57: in other words, everyone is constantly overgeneralizing, and this is fine &amp; necessary

2022-09-01 at 04:55:28: everyone is constantly overgeneralizing

2022-09-01 at 04:54:37: and this is why I say:

https://t.co/4QuBX7cCBN

2022-09-01 at 04:54:37: how I like to think about this is that every subjective being is always explaining / making sense of THE WHOLE OF EVERYTHING, and doing so based on SOME BUT NOT ENOUGH DATA

so the experiences we've had necessarily get stretched to cover the rest of everything

2022-09-01 at 04:54:36: so more precisely, I might say something like "all generalizations about reality from personal experience are overgeneralizations" but probably even there this is still an overgeneralization!

2022-09-01 at 04:54:36: "all generalizations are overgeneralizations"

including this one! in particular, I would say that mathematical generalizations are generally correctly-sized

2022-09-01 at 04:54:35: "all generalizations are overgeneralizations"

that doesn't mean they aren't still useful!

2022-09-01 at 04:54:35: all generalizations are overgeneralizations

2022-09-01 at 04:52:31: "overgeneralization(s)" is a word

2022-09-01 at 03:30:30: @_ali_taylor you run into meta-cultural problems here where a lot of how most orgs make things work is via clear roles, that would preclude having leaders do anything that looks too therapeutic with their reports

and yet some cultural norms/practices just *are* therapeutic in the background

2022-09-01 at 03:29:43: @_ali_taylor there are lots of people looking at related questions re organizations... like Robert Kegan's An Everyone Culture, or Brave New Work, or Senge's The Fifth Discipline, which is about Learning Organizations

2022-08-30 at 15:55:23: ahh, and I think he's also critiquing people who avoid FEELING the pain of whatever was lost as a result of the mistake

although "lost" still sort of treats the counterfactual world as the default, which is the confusion I'm trying to point at here

slippery stuff, fuck

2022-08-30 at 15:54:04: revisiting the original tweet (rephrased) maybe my point is that truly recognizing *in first person* that you cannot change anything about the past opens up a whole different kind of learning

(so below has causal arrow backwards)
https://t.co/EoJlhjlwmT

2022-08-30 at 15:39:22: ah and the other missing piece here is coherence empathy, which is grokking that in fact doing exactly what you did was *actually* what made sense to you at the time

that's true while also it had costs. don't negate, bring those in dialogue to get a bigger perspective for future

2022-08-30 at 15:39:22: also if you are beating yourself up about things, you don't have to beat yourself up about that

but it's okay if you do, etc etc √ó‚ôæ
https://t.co/HZUFSh75ht

2022-08-30 at 15:39:21: ah, here's another way to point at the post-regret insight, kinda with less confusion:

beating yourself up about something that happened generally doesn't help

there's already whatever happened and how you feel‚Äîadding any extra pain/problem is fake

2022-08-30 at 15:39:20: for an old beautiful post of mine exploring the spiritual insight about transcending regret &amp; mistakes (without the later third-more-complex-thing insight that this thread is about)

check out this piece:
https://t.co/MyrnAMrfDb

2022-08-30 at 15:39:20: there's a powerful spiritual insight to be found in seeing how in some sense you couldn't have avoided making all the mistakes you made

and there's lots of low-hanging fruit to be found in taking them seriously so you can make new ones next time
https://t.co/2XEdvTMu3q

2022-08-30 at 15:39:19: I've still got a lot to learn re actually cultivating that much diligence &amp; excellence. Whether it's fear of success or fear of rejection or something else, I often make underpreparedness-shaped mistakes

eg this could probably have been way better
https://t.co/ZG7HTaXbC3

2022-08-30 at 15:39:18: we learned interesting stuff from the disruption, and a co-host was emphasizing those, but when she said she wasn't that surprised by it happening I was like "wait, but why didn't we do something to prevent that then?! then we could have found out how well it was possible to do!"

2022-08-30 at 15:39:18: this first struck me many years ago, when I was part of hosting an event, and an oversight on our part meant that some participants showed up without any buy-in to what we were doing, and dramatically disrupted something others had flown across the continent for

2022-08-30 at 15:39:17: in Larson's autobiographical musical Tick... Tick... BOOM! he finally does an amazing workshop of the musical he's been working on for 6yr. lots of people love it but it doesn't get picked up for production, allowing Sondheim to finally convince him to move on &amp; do something new

2022-08-30 at 15:39:17: and maybe the deeper lesson here is you were actually scared of finding that out!

either because you're scared of the life-change or scared of what it would mean if your idea got rejected despite a good pitch, vs being able to say "well he just didn't like my pitch"

2022-08-30 at 15:39:16: for example, maybe you have the opportunity to pitch someone your idea, and if it lands it could change your life

if you don't prepare, you'll learn the lesson "better prepare", but you won't find out if a well-prepared pitch could have worked

2022-08-30 at 15:39:16: it's worth cultivating diligence to avoid making small mistakes that keep you from making more interesting mistakes

but also, if you somehow fail to do this, there may be a deeper learning to be found there

2022-08-30 at 15:39:15: I've thought about regret a lot over the years &amp; I think there's a real difference betw when you learn a lot vs getting an old lesson again at great cost

eg if you sleep in &amp; miss a workshop, that may teach you a lesson about alarm clocks... that is less useful than the workshop https://t.co/lV0Y6wvZb7

this is not true for biology

2022-08-30 at 13:08:03: In retrospect I guess I came to disagree with my own initial conclusion‚Äîof COURSE it was written in the 1930s! Later on it would have seemed closer but perhaps less plausible. Certainly by now nobody could write it.

2022-08-30 at 12:31:16: Someone write a novel in which a new form of blockchain-based governance is put to the test and needs to evolve in order to keep up.

Someone write a novel in which automation has freed us from doing jobs we don't like, and somehow we still find meaningful stuff to do.

2022-08-30 at 12:31:15: It occurs to me that some of these could also be based on extrapolation of current technology!

Someone write a novel in which the protagonists are succeeding at deploying therapeutic reconsolidation at scale and successfully dealing with opposition or challenges.

2022-08-30 at 12:31:15: So I'm also ultimately more interested in sincere eutopian or protopian visions like Huxley's later book Island.

As incomplete they'll inevitably be, they plant seeds of a future worth moving towards.

2022-08-30 at 12:31:14: It makes me wonder what a more contemporary extrapolated-future dystopia would look like. I'm recalling Circle by Eggers, but it's still too near-future. Is shit too weird now to imagine such an extremely distant future? Maybe.

On the gripping hand...
https://t.co/Btfuq5tPtJ

2022-08-30 at 12:31:14: The improbability of this dystopia is oddly encouraging. When I imagine infants being raised in the ultra-sterile atomistic procedural conditioned ways they are in BNW, they all come out stunted with attachment disorders, no rationalistic intellectuals nor obedient servants.

2022-08-30 at 12:31:14: It makes sense though: modern man writes modern dystopia.

2022-08-30 at 12:31:13: I think Huxley, at least at the time, didn't understand evolution and memetics well enough (no fault to him‚Äîthe concept of memetics hadn't been invented/discovered yet!) and was thus overestimating the workability of top-down statically-controlled culture.

2022-08-30 at 12:31:13: While aspects of the dystopia are disturbingly familiar, and I agree with Huxley that sedating/enculturating the masses is more likely than subduing with violence (which he wrote in a 1949 letter to Orwell re 1984)

...I don't find Brave New World to be a likely attractor.

2022-08-30 at 12:31:12: In some ways, Brave New World is a deutschian dystopia, which is to say a world in which technological advancement is consciously used in service of propagating anti-rational memes and perpetuating a static society (David Deutsch's terms)

2022-08-30 at 12:31:12: Just read Huxley's Brave New World, all in one sitting. Nothing in particular on my mind to say but figured if I wrote a thread and said the obvious, it would be interesting to someone.

The main thing that struck me was "damn, he wrote this in 1932?"

2022-08-30 at 08:09:35: @Meaningness So you might just want to start at ch3 tbh. I haven't gotten far enough into that section to have much of a take on it yet.

2022-08-30 at 08:08:00: @Meaningness There'll be almost nothing new in Chapter 2, since based on what I've seen you write, you could have written most of it. It has an amusing energy tho‚Äî ~"if you're gonna have sex as a dzogchen practitioner, what are you gonna do, leave your rigpa outside the bedroom door?"

2022-08-30 at 08:06:37: @Meaningness So far I'm a few chapters in and it's been pretty dry, though with a few interesting clarifications. His basic take is "this stuff had to be secret for a long time to keep things safe, but now it's safer to have more transparency to help people avoid abuses" which is interesting!

2022-08-30 at 07:10:49: the fact that chemistry reduces to physics is intricately related to the fact that both apply everywhere in the universe.

biology does not

(exception proving rule: geometric necessities like cube-square laws &amp; lung/tree space-filling fractals)

2022-08-30 at 04:38:10: @PlaneHarvester yeah, this sort of thing can totally be an iterative process

more important that you keep exploring it and finding out what it wants to be than that you get it perfectly right on any particular occasion

2022-08-25 at 14:14:51: @meekaale @DRMacIver mmm yeah
Complice is fairly good at just starting fresh I think when you first come back, and then later it mentions "hey, wanna fill in your streak?" if there's only a few days to fill

and otherwise doesn't mention it at all

2022-08-25 at 11:12:39: Your mind is already totally capable of resolving many many kinds of conflicts, provided that it is given enough space &amp; time &amp; attention to do so.

This also requires allowing the conflict to exist in the first place, rather than desperately clinging to fixing it.

2022-08-25 at 11:12:38: He suggests that the way to resolve conflicts is by "deciding", and while this is sometimes true, a gentler and more robust approach is to direct your attention to the reality of the conflict on one level and to the levels above the conflict that are generating it, then wait.

I want to concede that in some sense Matt/Trinley is clearly operating at a level beyond mine with this stuff

while also maintaining that there's some sense in which most people need a figure-ground inversion to stop constantly fighting themselves

2022-08-25 at 07:50:48: @mattgoldenberg @xuenay @DaystarEld "environmental change" doesn't seem to me to fall under counteractive nor transformational, but is a third category altogether

I'm not saying "singing *of* it", I'm saying "singing it". It is the song, the sound, the mouth, the ears, the rhythms, the words, in each eternal moment.

And in this sense (and perhaps this sense only üòÜ) Leonard Cohen sang.

2022-08-25 at 05:09:36: @DRMacIver But like at this point I have a 1000+ day streak of days where I know what I did that day, and so it's just obviously worth going back and filling in a missing few days if I was offline or scattered for a bit.

2022-08-25 at 05:08:08: @DRMacIver These fixes work pretty well in my experience, though to some extent they trade off against each other, since you can convert the chillstreak into a full streak anyway by back-filling the missing days.

2022-08-25 at 05:07:18: @DRMacIver Yup!

I've tried 2 things to fix that for Complice:
1. it doesn't force you to check in every day‚Äîyou can keep a streak alive by going back later and saying what you did that day.
2. it also tracks a chillstreak: don't miss 2 days in a row

2022-08-22 at 05:26:17: @relic_radiation @ElodesNL @Jeanvaljean689 I share your aesthetic sense of the non-battle-related beauty of music, and how it can connect us with the world!

and I suspect these are related. music lives in the right hemisphere, which connects with what's larger, whether that's our immediate human superorganism or gaia

2022-08-22 at 05:25:28: "superorganism" is a word

2022-08-22 at 05:15:03: @relic_radiation @ElodesNL @Jeanvaljean689 note that any documented behaviors of any indigenous people throughout history are WAY AFTER the supposed evolutionary event that the article was talking about, so are not evidence about how/why singing FIRST appeared.

obviously any culture would repurpose it for other magic!!

2022-08-22 at 05:14:16: "repurpose" is a word

(huh, my dictionary already had "repurposed")

2022-08-22 at 05:12:06: @relic_radiation @ElodesNL @Jeanvaljean689 &gt; Singing was huge in that, &amp; ‚Äòbattle trance‚Äô is the least of it

how do you know? I'm not talking about that "indigenous people lived in wildly different states of consciousness", which seems very self-evident. how do you know that singing pre-dates superorganisming?

2022-08-22 at 05:09:07: @thinkagainer ah nice, thanks, this helps

these are both great examples of someone lying due to it not feeling safe to tell the truth, and handling that by shifting away from the lie towards the safety

my loose framework: 3 kinds of lying:
- fear of punishment
- pathological
- sociopathic

2022-08-22 at 05:05:06: @xuenay @mattgoldenberg @DaystarEld my read is that
concentration meditation, at least as practiced by many people
even IF it eventually works
often causes substantial technical debt due to the counteractiveness of it

this view largely cribbed from @meditationstuff, who can weigh in
(somewhat from dzogchen too)

2022-08-22 at 05:02:55: "counteractiveness" is a word

2022-08-22 at 05:01:55: @xuenay @mattgoldenberg @DaystarEld mmm, no, skill-building is training but not counteractive in the emotional coherence sense unless you've got emotionally strong memories that you're fighting against, and if you do (eg traumatic memories of an accident) then probably you do actually want to use reconsolidation!

2022-08-22 at 05:01:47: "mmm" is a word

2022-08-22 at 05:01:33: "reconsolidation" is a word

2022-08-22 at 04:59:58: @xuenay @mattgoldenberg @DaystarEld oh really?! I don't remember that part. do you remember where in the book it is or a term to search for?

2022-08-22 at 04:43:07: okay, so the easy version, which many people have adopted, assumes the lie is about something that the other person observed firsthand

try the hard one: a situation where something is sus and the pieces don't add up, but there's no direct contradiction to it

2022-08-21 at 17:02:38: @Johnicholas I am in general aware of the ongoing cycle where people doing real stuff to jump to new terms when old ones get coopted/corrupted/confused/etc (this is happening with "game b" and "tpot" to some degree)

but web*, da*, etc, have had haters from the beginning; seems different

2022-08-21 at 16:58:25: @Johnicholas oh really? I feel like that suggests a way broader version of the word "scam" than I would use, eg even if those concepts are all fucked, the person could simply be naive, not out to deceive others

anyway,
1: totally possible
2: weird frame but yeah I don't promote scams

2022-08-21 at 16:44:56: someone who knows NVC better than me, how would you reframe "you're lying", either as the speaker or as the listener?

(I'm asking not because of a real situation, but as a blogpost case study)

2022-08-21 at 15:21:18: @Johnicholas fascinating! I can see how someone could get that impression from it (like I'm not literally like "did we read the same link?") but it reads to me like a very sincere and excited view of an evolutionary attractor in teamwork space

the self-coercion journey can take you all the way to that, if you want

2022-08-21 at 12:31:22: @AskYatharth I don't think I've had it as bad as some people, and I've also been working on it for longer than most (since 2012) and I have the sense there are still deeper layers for me

my major relationship-ending this year was actually a pretty key piece; think I'm on the home stretch now

2022-08-21 at 12:17:46: the existence of confusion implies the existence of confission

2022-08-21 at 10:57:39: @xuenay @mattgoldenberg @DaystarEld I feel like my take is something like "sure, try counteractive once, but if it fails, don't keep forcing it"

(also totally fine to use willpower when lifting weights, as long as you can tell apart resistance from "injury imminent" signals)

is there something I'm missing here?

2022-08-21 at 10:27:18: @camron @the_wilderless it sorta feels itself under the surface, but doesn't quite activate the usual stuff that would be described as "feeling the thing"

one can seem and experience oneself as very happy, while repressing feels of sadness or pain

"feeling" is maybe kind of an overloaded term here

See many NNTD posts here. There are other angles but in some sense several of these posts say the whole thing!

2022-08-19 at 07:51:19: @ThanksThoth Yeah depending on what you're wearing, as a dude it's possible to do the whole thing without touching anything but your clothes (and maybe the toilet). Toilet kinda gnarly tho, that's what does it for me.

2022-08-18 at 15:24:52: ah actually there are a few thousand words of subsection of these that have been turned into blog posts, but in terms of the total wordcount, there are a dozen shorter pieces that would make that much longer anyway

2022-08-18 at 15:21:31: main unpublished writings, in rough chrono order:
- ‚ÄúH3‚Äù &amp;‚ÄúNNTD‚Äù as specific protocols &amp; meta-protocols
- Mindset choice revisited: expanding awareness
- How we get there
- [org] strategic plan
- Wtf is the deal with the synergic mode?

total ~45k words

2022-08-18 at 14:53:34: weird that in business &amp; product development we use the phrase "roadmap" to refer to something more like a planned route

when an actual roadmap is more like a possibility field with no intentions or directions whatsoever

2022-08-18 at 10:43:41: @Caroline30 This sorta feels like a cheating answer, because it's not "one thing" but it was my embodied felt sense answer, and to try to name a specific body part or physiological function (although I could!) would have not been the same.

It's a holistic thing.

2022-08-18 at 10:39:47: @Caroline30 Most of what feels present for me is not really about gender but about sex, like dimorphism.

I love inhabiting my male body, in basically all ways, and I love how it all makes sense with itself.
I miss out on living in a female body, in all of its ecstasies and discomforts.

2022-08-18 at 05:10:46: @realtimeai @m_ashcroft @daemonhugger Maybe what Mashy meant was more like "representative" than "authentic".

2022-08-18 at 04:54:44: @houshuang moreover, this makes it an inherently social riffing process, rather than a solo process

2022-08-18 at 03:05:04: why, for what purpose would one employ brevity in speech, favoring a diminished quantity of few words, when instead one could use vast mountains of many words, in order for one's utterances to do the trick?

2022-08-18 at 02:59:06: @daemonhugger @visakanv @ungatedcreative Boom! Thanks so much for the feedback. The numbers you asked for are actually kind of epic. Did like a dozen takes of the new version, only the last 2 actually in the water.

2022-08-15 at 20:18:31: slightly more concretely, someone can ask you a yes-or-no question where the answer is "yes" in your frame but saying "yes" would cause them to be more confused about reality than saying "no"

(ideally there's enough time and buy-in to pause and explain/reframe, but not always!)

2022-08-15 at 11:10:36: @Human__Age maybe the lil dives are a bad idea when alone? I'm open to that possibility, and as fun as they are I could stick to just the swimming and do the dives when I'm at the restaurant that has a pool and a bunch of people around (tho still no official lifeguard afaik)

2022-08-15 at 11:09:21: @Human__Age hmm I mean I've mostly been blowing bubbles and swimming underwater in a small pool (tho deeper than I am tall)... feels largely well within my comfort zone; I've recovered from accidentally inhaling a little water way more times than I can count

2022-08-15 at 06:18:42: I subsequently did a couple of okay dives and short underwater swims but something seems spooked and I'm having trouble breathing consistently compared to yesterday

more experimentation to come :)

2022-08-15 at 06:17:59: update, tried diving in the pool this morning and some combo of confusion and diving too deep (I flipped over) meant that I stopped exhaling (enough) and got a bunch of water in my nose

maybe should have warmed up before the dive? hmm

2022-08-15 at 06:16:50: @jonnym1ller where?

2022-08-15 at 06:16:12: @senguidev My impression (and I've heard others talk about this) is that practicing &amp; playing with using it 100s of times allows it to go faster to the point where it becomes automatic. If not, then yeah, wouldn't be worth using every time. If so, ABSOLUTELY worth making that shift.

2022-08-15 at 06:12:18: @jessicamalonso @meaning_enjoyer yeah fwiw I was sort of reasoning by analogy here, tho it's related

"hit on" is even more ambiguous than "sexual assault" - it can refer to something wanted or unwanted, and a HUGE range of behaviors from a subtle subtext to aggressive touch or questioning.

eh, barely
I don't like it &amp; don't use it
so I don't want it in my dictionary (since it would be a typo if I did)
but people do use it (I don't see it often) and I do recognize it, so in that sense it gets the job done and is thus a word, prescriptivism be damned https://t.co/oaTng7FpwZ

2022-08-14 at 18:35:24: @jessicamalonso @meaning_enjoyer I think it's hugely problematic that we don't have separate terms for "sexual contact that was unwanted but the other person was engaged in wishful thinking" vs "sexual contact that was unwanted and the other person was getting off on that fact"

obviously it's complex, but still

2022-08-14 at 18:31:02: @jessicamalonso @meaning_enjoyer my experience is that a ton of the fear is due to not being able to gauge where you are on the map

which is defs partly lack of attunement but is also due to the ambiguity of what the complaints refer to

"he sexually assaulted me" - grope or penetration? 3rd date or boss?

2022-08-14 at 18:27:29: "attunement" is a word

2022-08-14 at 17:59:09: I kinda do want to hit a streak on doing *something* towards growth each day, til the end of bali

okay fuck it's @ 24:37. I came back intending to do a complice thread, and apparently what I wanted to do on net was to fuck around on twitter, mostly

and that's in some sense profoundly okay

2022-08-14 at 17:56:36: this means that which category a word falls into depends on context! the word "ontum" isn't googleable, but someone who sees me use it on twitter may well look it up and find my thread:

2022-08-14 at 17:56:35: if what makes something a protologism is that it hasn't been published anywhere...

I think the difference between a prelogism and a neologism is roughly that with a neologism you can look up the meaning somewhere even tho it's new, whereas a prelogism you can't

2022-08-14 at 17:56:34: I can sorta see the use for those concepts, especially "protologism" to refer to unpublished jargon used in private notes or by a closed group, but every prelogism wants to be a neologism so there's an incentive to say that it is (I do this)

2022-08-14 at 17:56:34: oh fascinating, just discovered that "neologism" is supposed to refer specifically to a word that is new but has substantial traction

before that it's a "prelogism"
and before that it's a "protologism"

...unfortunately, neither of those words took off! üòÜ

2022-08-14 at 17:55:31: "googleable" is a word

2022-08-14 at 17:41:43: "exaptation" is a word
(a neologism, but coined in 1982 and has 20k papers about it so it should be in fucking dictionaries by now)

2022-08-14 at 17:35:20: worth noting that there may be a "should you reverse any advice you hear" thing here

afaict this new approach is thoroughly backed by systems thinking and in some sense universally applicable, but its pragmatic usefulness for me rn may be related to the phase I'm at

ymmv!

2022-08-14 at 17:35:20: of course, the even further extremes of "get myself to do" are "make myself do" or "force myself to do".

but it's not about the force, it's just that "get" is still privileging the perspective that already *wants* to do the thing, not the part that is disallowing it.

2022-08-14 at 17:35:19: I'm practicing this on really basic stuff atm

eg "can I allow myself to get out of bed?" üõå
which was the motivating impetus for the first tweet in this thread (which I thought I'd tweeted a couple days ago but apparently it got lost somehow)

2022-08-14 at 17:35:18: this is a lens on using the therapeutic reconsolidation process *in each moment*

https://t.co/tBFlN4v1Ze

2022-08-14 at 17:35:18: so the question is:
if I supposedly want to do a thing, and I'm not, can I find the part of me that doesn't want to do it, inhabit its perspective, see what it's caring for, and bring that into contact with my desire to do the thing &amp; the whole situation?

2022-08-14 at 17:35:17: so there's a part of me, in other words, that isn't *allowing* me to do the thing that I supposedly want to do (I say "supposedly" because the part claiming I want to is necessarily also partial)

and that's the part with the agency to enable the thing!

2022-08-14 at 17:35:17: if "I want to do the thing", great! the motivation IS THERE, for some part of me calling itself Malcolm.

the issue is that some *other* part of me doesn't want to do the thing, for whatever reason, or I'd simply be doing it

https://t.co/9DgeXxmPc4

2022-08-14 at 17:35:16: I am coming to the conclusion that everything I was trying to get myself to do is better approached by exploring how to allow myself to do it

üò§‚úã‚ùå how do I get myself to do the thing?

2022-08-14 at 15:37:15: @visakanv interestingly tho I was one character short on that tweet, so I was like "fuck I need to edit something" and since I didn't feel like removing a word I decided to edit "because" to "bc" but somehow I don't really feel like "bc" is a word yet, so I left the squiggles

2022-08-14 at 15:36:11: @visakanv also I'm the perfect person to do it bc I basically never make typos or spelling mistakes (somehow) so I just actually don't expect to see the red squiggles ever

2022-08-14 at 15:04:53: lol @visakanv is the only one who has liked these tweets. he gets it. I guess most people don't really get his thread I compared mine to, so uhh I really can't be surprised here üòÖ

2022-08-14 at 15:04:46: "lol" is a word

2022-08-14 at 15:02:47: @JgaltTweets @NathanpmYoung yeah, or potentially a way to make a bunch of money by publishing a fake story üò¨

one of the things that currently makes me relatively inclined to believe people who share their stories about this stuff is that there's not much benefit to faking one. if there *were*...

2022-08-14 at 14:59:54: @AskYatharth @jessicamalonso someone pointed out that the "..." may imply that "hit on" is being used sort of euphemistically, which is an important point but doesn't much affect the thing I'm concerned about here

https://t.co/EjA0rSyALZ

2022-08-14 at 14:57:44: @AskYatharth @jessicamalonso probably someone has ever said this:

"just got hit on at an EA meetup! finally an opportunity to date someone who shares my values. I'm so sick of randos on dating apps!"

although maybe not the gal who wrote the original post!

2022-08-14 at 14:57:35: this thread is a fucking blast. I've been wanting to do it for a long time but didn't want to start after some words were already in my dict because then they'd never get added

I use a nonstandard word like every other tweet, sometimes 2-3 in one tweet üòÆ https://t.co/8RgypxHSya

2022-08-14 at 14:55:51: "randos" is a word

2022-08-14 at 14:52:06: @AskYatharth @jessicamalonso I think it's actually slightly implied by her opener "just got hit on at an EA meetup :/" that people shouldn't do that (that = 'hit on @ EA'). ofc then you get the "creepy men shouldn't" distinction

contrast "someone just tried to hit on me really misattunedly at an EA meetup"

2022-08-14 at 14:51:16: "misattunedly" is a word

2022-08-14 at 14:47:53: @jessicamalonso @WillGraywood @AskYatharth largely I resonate with Jessica's perspective here, though I'll note she says "creepy men", not "creepy interactions" which evokes a judgment of him (which is sort of proto-ostracism) rather than just a "this is my internal 'no' signal"

2022-08-14 at 14:46:45: "proto-" is a prefix

2022-08-13 at 08:55:37: @AskYatharth @ChasingMyself @Morphenius @vervaeke_john if you haven't come across this paper, I'd recommend checking it out, as it's pointing at a very fundamental phenomenon in human relating

&gt; communication ‚Äì and specifically language, in terms of which explicit rules are formulated ‚Äì presupposes virtual bargaining

2022-08-13 at 08:41:52: @AskYatharth @ChasingMyself @Morphenius animals also do simulated negotiation, backing down rather than fighting to the death, when it's clear who would win

but my sense is that humans can do it way deeper or more "internally" or something

2022-08-13 at 08:40:45: @AskYatharth @ChasingMyself @Morphenius oh, this ~game theory paper is also super relevant, talking about how people simulate each other and negotiate then execute the results of the negotiation when there's an obvious outcome (not just in zero sum contexts)

2022-08-13 at 05:19:37: @visakanv like currently a lot of that happens implicitly through the reviews. a lot of these Q are subtle though... maybe the thing to do would be to add them to the yearly reviews, like
- how has what I want evolved re this goal?
- how has the world changed? what opportunities exist now?

2022-08-13 at 05:18:05: @visakanv oooh, yeah. Complice doesn't directly guide you through doing all of these things, no. It's a better scaffold for it than most systems because it does keep goals on your radar rather than just piles of tasks &amp; projects.

I want to add more stuff for iterating strategy.

2022-08-11 at 12:01:37: last tip, tho it applies more to words-first freestyling than rhythm-first freestyling, is to have something to say. you might deviate from it‚Äîthat's great!‚Äîbut pick a topic to start with, even just describing your surroundings or talking about your day so far

2022-08-11 at 12:01:37: which, honestly, since most people can't readily make sense of rapid-fire 400-600 syllables per minute *anyway*...

...is already kind of impressive. act cocky like you're saying deep stuff and if people don't understand they're just not following

2022-08-11 at 12:01:36: the key I've found is to actually just start making syllables this fast and focusing on making sure to keep making sounds at this tempo, then kinda filling them in with words that work/rhyme &amp; make any sense meanings.

start by sounding funky but unintelligible

2022-08-11 at 12:01:36: (example of the fast style I'm referring to‚ÄîI'm not quite hitting this tempo (...73bpm) and also obviously since I'm freestyling the lyrics aren't this good)
https://t.co/7pl4E0lmMP

2022-08-11 at 12:01:36: I've started doing some freestyle in a fast-style rap, like Busta Rhymes in Look At Me Now (see next tweet) and it's really trippy. So far just doing it alone under my breath, which is necessary because it's not compatible with self-consciousness OR filtering.

2022-08-11 at 09:44:44: @bilalghalib no "but" here as far as I'm concerned! etymologies are the shit! and at this point we're not going to lose track of how things changed. and sometimes meanings do completely reverse, and that's part of the fun of evolving language. it's all live play

2022-08-11 at 09:43:26: @aleksil79 online ones could. they could have people and web-crawlers actively checking for evolving meanings like this, somehow

would be neat actually to see if my parents or grandparents would also understand this use of "pretext"‚Äîit might not actually be that new!

2022-08-11 at 09:28:56: the replies to this all agreeing that they use it similarly to me is amplifying my pre-existing distaste for dictionaries.

apparently, in practice, pretext or pretense can both mean "a not particularly deceitful cover reason for doing something"

2022-08-10 at 19:29:13: I keep wanting to use "pretext" or "pretense" in a slightly incorrect way, basically "I used it as a pretense to message her". Pretense implies active deception though, &amp; what I mean is more like just an impetus, but also a reason. "excuse" is closest denotationally but also bad?

ie other phases where you could get to a lower level of abundance that would be hard to get out of because you wouldn't have the slack to be strategic

eg a shitty exhausting job, no time to start next biz

2022-08-10 at 08:37:46: @khemaridh I find it helps to really know exactly what I want. Both that jealousy can be a pointer to what I want, and also that when I get really clear on what I want it usually becomes obvious that I don't want *exactly* what they have. So then it becomes more like inspiration to remix.

Yeah so in this model, you could feel concern, care, compassion, &amp; plenty of motivation to do something, that'd be about the world (as you perceive it)

But that if it's showing up as physiological fear, you feel personally threatened (or you have confused other for self)

2022-08-05 at 11:18:16: wtf, I tried to find one of my own posts (a pretty obscure one) and it's mirrored on this site that is aggressively trying to get me to give them ad revenue

is there anything I could or should do about this? it ranked higher on brave search, tho not on google https://t.co/eKkJzDkXFD

2022-08-05 at 01:41:29: @EyalShay2 Also true!

2022-08-05 at 01:41:18: @the_wilderless @s0ulDirect0r yup, totally
the point is that insofar as those things remove internal friction, they do so by removing external friction that's preventing the internal friction from solving itself

2022-08-03 at 23:59:16: @myceliummage I guess there's sort of a few dimensions there.

One is that the "goal-crafting" frame doesn't really imply doing a bunch of emotional work (we could probably rewrite the site copy a bit üòÖ)

Could also still start an "untangling internal conflict" workshop with visioning! Hmm..!

2022-08-03 at 23:54:24: @myceliummage I seriously think it makes a huge difference. We've talked about running a workshop more geared towards "untangling internal conflict" or something, since that theme has shown up so much at GCIs...

2022-08-03 at 23:49:25: @myceliummage this is one of the beautiful things about the goal-crafting workshops I run‚Äîthey start by asking "what's your vision for your life &amp; the world?"

this points at how humans have hardware for this, in multiperspectival ways

2022-07-31 at 15:54:23: @DevinFidler @RichDecibels hmmm, makes me think that in a sense an even further movement is basically "helping the whole"

2022-07-31 at 14:14:02: @nvpkp yeah, I'm curious! I've also been recognizing that there's something funny about the relationship between OSes &amp;  browsers

https://t.co/Nk4XTyZuEJ

2022-07-31 at 14:13:25: one magical thing about this, and one reason I don't use desktop slack or the native mobile twitter app

is that the browser-tab approach affords having the same app open to multiple pages/states at the same time, which complex native apps usually resist

https://t.co/IydmPvvOb7

2022-07-31 at 14:13:24: the operating system needs a redesign for the reality that many‚Äîbut not all!‚Äîapplications live in web browser frames now

shouldn't have separate native-window-management then browser-manages-tabs; this is a weird historical accident, not an intentional state of affairs

2022-07-31 at 13:32:41: @parkerdhicks my take:
message truly "thee" = is it really coming from your perspective?
message also "not-three" = is it also coming from a larger perspective?

like obvi the universe is there
but also like, I'm here

2022-07-31 at 11:19:43: last thing I'll say before wrapping this thread for now is that there's definitely a huge connection between gently-die meditation &amp; [Alexander Technique, non-doing, expanding awareness,.]

eg this @m_ashcroft vid might be pointing at the exact same move:
https://t.co/0IQCa51o0W

2022-07-31 at 11:16:39: in this convo with @_brentbaum, we talk at one point about how to make that page even more conducive to this kind of utter letting go

https://t.co/c8QVu0O5ZX

2022-07-31 at 11:15:21: meanwhile I've been realizing that a lot of my design thinking over the past few years has been realigning with this letting go and being in the not-knowing space of "what now?"

my thoughts on overhauling browsers / operating systems, &amp; this new feature:
https://t.co/V4fT6SAdVp

2022-07-31 at 11:13:08: and as far as I can tell a really important skill is staying profoundly in touch with my own perspective while also taking someone else's

this is what interpersonal depth perception is made of
https://t.co/RxIalO86Dz

2022-07-31 at 11:12:12: @Nsousanis @NASA @TheAtlantic @AdamKinzinger occurs to me that one reason it matters might be DALL-E 3+

2022-07-31 at 11:09:24: and I can readily loose my first-person-ness
- thinking about something
- trying to do something
- recording an insight for future-me
- talking to someone, taking their perspective

but afaict it's possible to stay in touch with it while doing those things
https://t.co/Dc0gMiHhBI

2022-07-31 at 11:07:46: the mind is a funny sense organ because its loopy nature allows it to loose track of its own first-person-ness

2022-07-31 at 11:06:57: I've noticed some sort of connection that I'm not yet sure how to articulate, between this and first-person-ness.

it seems that what I often want to access in meditation, which this helps with, is coming back to my own subjectivity

2022-07-31 at 11:02:32: my sense is that there's also something valuable about also exploring something like this in more of a traditional meditation container:
- have a timer &amp; bell, or a path to walk
- until the end of it, when an impulse arises, gently let it go and die again

2022-07-31 at 10:30:49: personally, I'm often inclined to follow those impulses, when I do this kind of thing. they're almost the point‚Äîwhatever arises after I let go is usually internally generated, rather than reactive (like scrolling twitter or whatever)

just remember to die again once complete

2022-07-31 at 10:30:42: anyway, some observations:

when I do this letting go, this gently dying, often within moments I notice something I'd not noticed, that I want to attend to‚Äîmaybe just going pee, maybe something more like "oh right, my plan for today was X!"

2022-07-31 at 10:16:52: @JohnSmi47913660 thanks John
btw, I recommend making a profile pic (even if it's not of your face) and changing your username to something other than the auto-generated one (here: https://t.co/jEg6hy8Kk3)

my first impression was like "is this a real person?"

2022-07-31 at 10:12:25: but I'm a healthy young adult with plenty of momentum to revive me moments or hours later, and in any case I'm not actually letting go of the intention to keep *breathing*

hell, often I'm not letting go of the intention to keep *walking* or *dancing* when I do this

die &amp; dance

2022-07-31 at 10:11:35: @babarganesh ah yeah nice. there are some great alexander technique'y tweets about this but I'm having trouble finding them to thread

one about "I realized that part of me was taking responsibility for making the whole universe keep going, and I could just... not do that"

cc @m_ashcroft

2022-07-31 at 10:05:27: it occurs to me as I write this that if someone were actually on their deathbed at the end of a long life or a long struggle with illness, then intending to gently die might actually result in their last breath

I've heard some such stories about human old-age death timing

2022-07-31 at 10:01:55: this caveat should go without saying, but: the intention I am pointing at is completely unrelated to any act of *killing*

"killing" takes an object‚Äîeven suicide is "I kill myself"
"dying" is purely first-person. it's a letting-go.
https://t.co/q5uUCykgTG

2022-07-31 at 09:59:06: sometimes things need to be said even though they feel like they really really should go without saying

2022-07-31 at 09:58:00: as far as an intentional meditation instruction goes, well, intention is weird when it comes to letting go, right? that's part of the whole puzzle

but weirdly, I've found that the word that points most directly at it for me is "die"‚Äîjust "I'm going to die now"

2022-07-31 at 09:53:43: my experience of that moment resonates a lot with Tilopa's famous 6 words

(though I forget when I made that connection)
https://t.co/413Q0qyh9n

2022-07-31 at 09:46:31: the experience of resting &amp; letting go was so profound I started crying &amp; gasping. ü•πüò≠

it was as if I'd never had *nothing* on my plate before, and suddenly I did, and I was so free.

2022-07-31 at 09:43:37: this first happened to me spontaneously when I went for a short walk without my phone after a really long &amp; challenging day that had culminated with me sending some important messages

I had the sense of "I've done what I need to do, I can rest now. it's in their/god's hands"

2022-07-31 at 09:41:49: Let go of what has passed.
Let go of what may come.
Let go of what is happening now.
Don‚Äôt try to figure anything out.
Don‚Äôt try to make anything happen.
Relax, right now, and rest.

by Tilopa (translated by Ken McLeod)

2022-07-31 at 09:40:15: I wanna tell yall about a meditation I invented where I let go as if I were dead:

2022-07-30 at 14:54:31: @QiaochuYuan liiiikewiiiiise

likewise "we shouldn't pass law X" vs "the government shouldn't pass law X"

2022-07-28 at 10:50:43: @jackinlondon @liminal_warmth true tho rare

also destroying all of someone's past tweets when they get suspended/banned is bad and we shouldn't do it 

(except in cases where the account is literally just spamming the same message or whatever, or maaaybe in certain other egregious cases)

2022-07-28 at 10:48:57: @Evolving_Ego nah, that's sort of the trivial case

the more general reason it breaks down is that people assume "if we disagree, at least one of us must be wrong" (implicit LEM)

2022-07-27 at 15:25:49: @eshear @m_ashcroft Exactly. You don't so much want to cultivate a felt sense of safety as you want to cultivate a calibrated and attuned sense of how-safe-you-are.

2022-07-22 at 21:43:37: @FlaviuCipcigan something still very unsolved there
lots of subreddits have rules against promoting stuff

can often still buy ads on those subreddits I guess
but my impression is that it's harder to target so tightly

just encourage more individual patreons

no reason to centralize this

2022-07-22 at 15:10:26: the original reason for the flight into London is that flights straight to Scotland are substantially pricier, but I also like the aesthetic of taking a train through the English countryside and up the coast.

phone off in the next room doesn't count

I mean like going for a walk without your phone, or hanging out in a park or at a restaurant without your phone.

(with new options!)

2022-07-21 at 21:40:25: wow, second guessed myself here, and underestimated you guys

originally the high separator was 4h+, and I was considering 6h. but then I figured maybe there'd be a lot of people who almost never did because that used to be me until I started making a point of it a few months ago

2022-07-21 at 20:43:57: occurs to me that I actually don't have to stay in europe at all. like that's the default, but I could go somewhere else immediately

my only other specific is an airbnb in Bali that's available to me starting Aug4

could go anywhere between now &amp; then. South Africa? Singapore?

2022-07-21 at 20:33:53: @Clo__S not at all aside from this ideation / trying to meme it into existence

we might see if @azlenelza wants to make it happen! I talked with him last year about some related ideas

2022-07-21 at 17:30:39: @Clo__S yeah, something like "except for sub-intents and background stuff like music players etc, everything else should be hidden"

doing this right is very complex, but I'm sure it's possible to do better than the current mess

also I remember around age 13 feeling kinda outcast and deciding I was nonetheless cool and everyone else was confused and missing out

2022-07-21 at 15:29:35: might end up needing a yoga mat as part of my travel gear, that I'll fold up and use for a standing desk mat when I'm working

I've good a good makeshift standing desk at the current airbnb but my feet are tiring because I only have a towel as a mat not my usual pro squishy one

2022-07-21 at 14:32:11: am so enjoying the profound unknowingness of not knowing which country I intend to be in tomorrow night

besides, our workshops are substantially better than they were 5 years ago! so, worth it.

2022-07-20 at 11:15:01: but then I realized that since we're already PayWhatYouWant, maybe it doesn't matter that much and it would be better to be a bulwalk against overinflation by not raising prices right now

were they in a context where other people were saying other things, or was it just them saying that phrase?

2022-07-18 at 13:49:01: I think when someone says "I'm not sure what to say"

what they mean is "there's some sort of difference in underlying assumptions here about what scene we're in and I'm not sure how to talk about that"

2022-07-18 at 01:07:02: one part of a concept for this:

https://t.co/gFRR6EKjom

2022-07-18 at 01:06:33: what if instead of opening a new tab or window, you opened a new... intent ‚õ∫Ô∏è

and then the tent contained your intention until it was completed, and could save state for later

and sub-intents, like "find tweet to QT in the thread I'm writing" would have their own system...

2022-07-18 at 01:01:26: @lisatomic5 one of the most important elements would be the ability to instantly sweep the desk clean, without losing old context forever, and to then attend to things one by one

aka my "tinder for tabs" concept:
https://t.co/4sgQuCklxO

2022-07-18 at 00:58:59: @lisatomic5 yeah, this ‚Üì feels related too

imagining an OS-sized version of complice, that is gently attentive to your state and your intention, and easefully guides you into reflection &amp; metacognition when that's the thing to do, or into action when that's it

2022-07-18 at 00:44:36: @DarbraDawn "trust as an unquestioning attitude" somehow seems relevant here, tho I'm not sure exactly how. but something about how you can have a confident external attitude without actually having a lot of self-trust or something

https://t.co/Yz0jaAzb3X

2022-07-18 at 00:36:44: to be clear I don't mean "attention management" software like focustime or pomodoro technique or a calendar

I mean something more like:
https://t.co/CrMw2OtIyf

2022-07-18 at 00:36:36: what about an operating system that naturally nurtures divinely inspired pathways of attention &amp; awareness?

(rather than throwing you to the sharks of scattered antagonistic chaos)

2022-07-18 at 00:31:05: @kalinh yup, but I still think that software could be that much better too

2022-07-17 at 21:49:53: @captain_mrs I also think about family/household economies!

2022-07-17 at 21:48:22: my medium-term plot involves becoming a guerrilla design/product consultant for companies that don't know how to ask "what if it were good tho?"

,. = etc.
., = etc,

this comes from Alfred Korzybski's Science &amp; Sanity / General Semantics, and encourages the use of language that recognizes that what it's saying is referentially incomplete

2022-07-17 at 11:45:56: @visakanv Synergetics by N Arthur Coulter has an interesting take that synergy between people requires them to regard each other with a kind of neutrality status-wise, or to each see the other as just slightly higher status

2022-07-15 at 14:57:12: @utotranslucence Maybe obvious but would these different sorts of people arrive having googled different stuff?

I guess otherwise part of the puzzle is how to not turn them off while you're still trying to figure out what sorts of things will resonate vs turn them off.

2022-07-15 at 14:55:09: @utotranslucence So far all I've done is basically be consistent‚Äîthe result is that Complice mostly just appeals to some types of people and not others.

So one pathway for you might be to just build out the product for one cluster, then make a different version, then add a sorting system.

2022-07-15 at 14:51:53: @utotranslucence Same problem tho‚Äîwhat reads to some users as profoundly friendly &amp; patient reads to others as obnoxiously passive aggressive, and neither group realizes that the other group/interpretation is possible.

2022-07-09 at 16:12:50: @rmbalt It's not *doing* extra.
You just go and log what you did that day, towards your goals or more generally. Often people do lots of goal-relevant stuff without planning it in the app, and this is very true for me.

= part of how Complice isn't just a "to-do" list. Also "btw, I did".

2022-07-09 at 16:10:30: @daemonhugger Not sure! Maybe I'd already been noticing my voice a bit

2022-07-09 at 16:10:07: @MasterTimBlais Asked out a couple gals on BART platform in 2013 while waiting for trains (two separate occasions). In each case: I met up with her later and hooked up, and she wanted to be dominated but it was weird. Useful learning experiences tho!

2022-07-09 at 01:02:06: @ben_r_hoffman @relic_radiation likewise, painfully-frequently-unfortunately, people often hear clarifying Qs as requests for justification

"so before we go out, you [said you] want to grab a snack?"
"yeah, I mean because I'm really hungry"
[I'm just confirming! no need to justify!]

(school ptsd probably)

2022-07-09 at 00:59:16: @ben_r_hoffman @relic_radiation I suspect a substantial amount of the apparent disagreement is due to differences on this level or similar levels

tho also a diff in mood. if I "don't feel like it", there are ways to inquire what I might feel like instead that don't have a justification energy

2022-07-09 at 00:55:44: @ben_r_hoffman @relic_radiation yeah this seems to me we'd benefit from specifying more detailed scenarios

if someone doesn't feel like doing something, &amp; you ask for reasons, there's usually a kind of tension/distrust there, vs letting them have their prefs unjustified

diff than "why step 2 in this recipe?"

2022-07-09 at 00:52:24: @piva_jonas hmmm

the original tweet is less of a metaphysical statement and more an attempt to correct a particular kind of error that people often make, which is sometimes known as a "should" or a "have to"

2022-07-09 at 00:50:55: @daemonhugger a bit rough, low but not super deep

2022-07-09 at 00:50:29: @utotranslucence This seems worth mentioning in a @slatestarcodex open thread or something... maybe someone'll pick it up! Either as a structured study or just more personal experience anecdotes to start with.

2022-07-08 at 10:00:59: @utotranslucence I was thinking about this a bit more

it might be worth considering a few specific situations in which there's a non-obvious high-value move you could point out, and how you'd figure out that the person's in that situation. build your tool around those, then flesh it out

2022-07-08 at 09:55:10: a popular myth is that people who are Very Meta have meta that works. nothing could be further from the truth. the Very Meta are capable of generating much more novel and fascinating ways to make meta not fucking work and exercise this capability wantonly

https://t.co/H34BQsPNTf

2022-07-08 at 09:11:25: letting other people make their own mistakes is a very basic and underappreciated form of respect

2022-07-08 at 09:09:30: @visakanv @selentelechia I'm not totally clear how this applies to things that will harm them but later

I think basically until they're able to understand why it's their problem, you should continue to treat it as your problem

2022-07-08 at 09:07:43: @visakanv @selentelechia relatedly, being really clear about "whose error is this?" seems VITAL for sane parenting

2022-07-08 at 08:20:12: @RichardMCNgo This then furthermore makes EA an anti-rational meme in Deutsch's sense, in that it colonizes its hosts and seeks to spread without accounting for their well-being or encouraging a conscious, sane relationship with the meme.

And any anti-rational meme is opposed to rationality.

2022-07-08 at 08:18:03: @RichardMCNgo Confused because it memetically seeks to be a source of meaning-in-life but is woefully inadequate for the task. Sure, it was not per se intended as such, but it ends up playing that role for lots of people, and this is sorta more evolutionarily fit for the meme than if it didn't

2022-06-25 at 19:51:57: One common pitfall in trying to create co-consciousness / IFS-Self-for-groups is having a single person (facilitator, leader, whatever) in the role of trying to ensure all ppl are heard. This is isomorphic to one part therapizing another.

Self is emergent.

2022-06-25 at 19:44:20: If "here we go with this again" triggers "should we end this?", that's a sign that people are in some sense in too far and/or in denial about what to expect. Promising themselves it'll be different this/next time when they have no ground to expect that.

2022-06-03 at 17:27:17: @visakanv @CompliceGoals part of the idea here is that Complice itself has a perspective, has opinions, has takes, that may not even exactly align with mine

and I can just have it speak from its own voice

@visakanv cracked up when I said this:

2022-06-03 at 08:03:48: @sashintweets eg @RoamResearch got huge because it questioned a bunch of assumptions about what links are, the meaning of "notes", etc

now a bunch of other apps are copying the new assumptions (&amp; seeing some new implications) but the next innovation comes from questioning yet more assumptions
