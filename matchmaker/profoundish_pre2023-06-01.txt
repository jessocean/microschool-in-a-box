2019-10-16 at 03:35:55: But for me, it was about Hong Kong, and I got caught up in groupthink and convinced myself that fighting Bliz was synonymous with supporting Hong Kongers. It's not. It's not really even related. If you wanna help Hong Kong, help Hong Kong. Bliz ain't their main concern over there

2019-10-16 at 03:35:54: I'm going to go back to Overwatch. I'm embarrassed at how I got swept up in this without really thinking through what I was doing and why. I think that those who are motivated to boycott Bliz should keep at it, if you're mad about censorship.

2019-10-16 at 03:35:54: I'm not at all trying to say people shouldn't boycott Blizzard, but I do think it's worth really analyzing what you're hoping to accomplish. Because I'm realizing I was misguided, and getting caught up in a situation where I could feel righteously angry.

2019-10-16 at 03:35:54: We've taken an international incident and used it as fuel for more Western navelgazing! We've been spouting about how we want to support Hong Kong, but really they just happened to be involved when Blizzard gave us a strategy we could use to mobilize against them.

2019-10-16 at 03:35:54: What Blizzard did was fucked up, yes. But what does punishing them do for Hong Kong? Nothing. And what has Blitzchung asked us to do? Not boycott Bliz. Support Hong Kong!

2019-06-30 at 20:07:40: The only version of myself I've ever really admired is so fickle, she's unstoppable right up until she stops. The only thing I've managed to sustain is being a needy whiny baby. What version of me is strong *and* knows how to pace herself? Where do I find that in me?

2019-06-30 at 20:07:40: I don't know who to become.

2019-06-30 at 20:07:39: I need a change, one that's sustainable. But right now, stability and the status quo feels very safe compared to change. And I don't know what to change into. I don't have any goals really, other than the next paycheck. I don't know what to do next. I don't know how to grow.

2019-06-30 at 20:07:39: So often I feel like I need some kind of revolution in my life. Karen House was that revolution once, and while a lot of good came from it, it also scarred me and wounded me. I'm so glad that I had the opportunity to grow like that, but I don't want to do it again.

2019-06-30 at 20:07:39: I think there is. I think there's a better way to do a lot of my life right now. But I don't have all the answers and I don't trust too many sources. I have a hard time accepting help, including with my mental health. (Oh jeez that's a revelation.)

2019-06-30 at 20:07:36: Well okay you're not just being a bad friend. You're also being an introvert. Just gotta understand those needs better. Learn how to communicate your social weirdness better. There must be a better way.

2019-06-30 at 20:07:35: Yeah but real talk your relationships suck. Right now at least. You're dodging calls and ignoring messages and just generally being a shitty friend. You know they'd much rather hear you be honest and vent about the craziness than just not hear from you at all.

2019-06-30 at 20:07:35: Damn. Feeling like a burden sucks. And I know that people would rather support my growth than maintain the status quo, but it still feels wrong to ask for help. And I'm afraid of being told no. I'm afraid of asking for too much and hurting my relationships.

2019-06-30 at 20:07:35: But then you just end up leaning way too hard on the few people you will let see that side of you, and it's not fair to them.

2019-06-30 at 20:07:34: But then I just feel like a big needy whiny baby! I *am* a big needy whiny baby! It's really hard to be that vulnerable when I have the option to just present this "I'm not doing too great but I'll be alright" persona and never accept help!

2019-06-30 at 20:07:34: Yeah you've got to stop doing that though xD I mean look, you're an introvert, sure. But you need community. Like I said, you need to better understand what you would need to be in community, express those needs, and trust your F&amp;LOs to respect them and support you.

2019-06-30 at 20:07:34: But people are so draining when I'm in a place of fatigue! Like, my friends and loved ones are the greatest source of happiness for me, but *any* level of social interaction requires a certain amount of energy from me, so when I don't have any energy, I shut people out.

2019-06-30 at 20:07:33: You've got to get better at understanding your needs and asking for help. You really suck at having help but you've got to find a way to let the people who love you into your life and help you.

2019-06-30 at 20:07:33: I know, but I don't really have the resources to find that stability!

2019-06-30 at 20:07:33: But I've got to keep moving if I want to live, and for some reason most days we do. You've got to find a way to really recharge though. You've been running on fumes for too long.

2019-06-30 at 20:07:32: I mean yeah, but I'm definitely still not doing great. I feel like I've been burnt out on life itself for months. And there's just been one big dramatic disaster after another, money struggles and relationship struggles and job struggles. I'm tired!

2019-06-30 at 20:07:32: Maybe. I definitely have a lot of it. Maybe I'm doing better under the circumstances than I give myself credit for?

2019-06-30 at 20:07:32: Imposter syndrome?

2019-06-30 at 20:07:31: Fair, but I still don't feel like I'm doing well with what I've got.

I've been told I need to stop giving so much more than I receive, but, I'm not gonna stop giving, I'm too picky to receive what people are willing to give, and too needy to get what I actually want, so... Yeah.

2019-06-06 at 04:43:52: And like, yeah, life happens, but also like... What good is an emotional support network if you can't lean on it when you need it? Why do I feel like I'm a bad person when I don't move mountains to help someone -- and even when I do! -- but never push anyone to step up for me?

2019-06-06 at 04:43:52: I have a few people in mind, but... One's asleep. Two are in bad places themselves. One low-key flaked on me (for a v good reason but still). One has barely bothered to talk to me for months.

2019-06-06 at 04:43:52: Right now I want physical proximity, reassurance of my worth, someone who can hold space in my silence, and who can use touch to soothe me in whatever way is appropriate. I need a damn good listener, but who can also sprinkle in some perspective. I want intimacy, comfort, love.

2019-06-06 at 04:43:51: I just... I wish I had normal boundaries and sense of expectations, because I don't know what's right for me to expect from people when I'm in these places. Is my frustration justified or entitled? Both? Idk. The fact that I have particular needs (am picky) doesn't help.

2019-06-06 at 04:43:51: I felt pretty good most of the day and now I feel empty. I'm there for so many people but I have such a hard time wrangling help, except from people I don't want around when I need to be nurtured (either bc they aren't great at it or just am not close enough to be vulnerable).

2019-05-29 at 10:15:35: (Real talk the *actual* reason I tweeted this is that I'm used to smoking after my night shift before I go to bed, and I'm missing the ritual. It's honestly less that I want to be high right now and more that it doesn't feel like bedtime yet because I haven't smoked. Yeah.)

2019-05-29 at 10:11:09: I have no plans to remove weed from my life, but I'm tired of not using it on my own terms. I'm getting help getting there, and I'm being kind to myself, trusting that I really want this, even when I lose ground. If you want this, you can do it. And you don't have to do it alone.

2019-05-29 at 10:11:09: Having a problem with weed (call it addiction or not) doesn't mean you have to go to rehab and quit cold turkey forever. Maybe those are the best options for some, but I think that people get scared thinking that's their only option, so scared they ignore the problem.

2019-05-29 at 10:11:09: But you do have to acknowledge that you have a problem before you can decide you want to fix it. And so whike I hope that being open will help me stay accountable to my goals, I'm also hoping that by being open about this I can help people be open with themselves.

2019-05-29 at 10:11:08: If you feel like weed has control of your life, fight back. Whether your goal is abstinence or reduced usage, there are ways to get there and people who will support you. The progress doesn't have to be linear or impressive. Just one step at a time.

2019-05-29 at 10:11:08: We often discourage people from talking about weed in terms of addiction, and this main supporter in my struggle agrees that it is a very different kind of addiction, but they have also seen the impact it has on my life (like 95% financial) and sees I'm not in full control.

2019-05-29 at 10:11:07: As always, I tweet this largely for the diary. But I also wanted to say to anyone reading this who isn't happy with their relationship to weed: it can change. It is a challenge, and if you need help please reach out to someone -- me, if you want. But you can do it.

2019-05-29 at 10:11:06: I have a lot of support, in particular someone who has struggled with addiction themself. Different chemicals, and now living in abstinence. They won't lie, they think it will be hard. But they support my goal of just reducing usage, and they believe in me. They know I can do it.

2019-05-29 at 10:11:06: It's still hard. Feels like I've stepped into a depressive episode, anhedonic, low energy,  but instead of emotionally flat I'm more irritable and more likely to be mad at the state of my life and the world. This, and withdrawal itself, makes my ideation act up too.

2019-05-29 at 10:11:05: CW: addiction. So, I have a weed addiction, and like many people who've struggled with it my goal isn't total abstinence, but my plan is to take breaks lower my tolerance and help reset my habits, because I can't just will myself into it. I'm starting small, just a few days.

2019-05-16 at 07:11:35: The veil between heaven and earth has felt more like a brick wall lately. What could break through!? There isn't a gentle stream between us and liberation, it's a deep sea. How will we cross it? "Return, o Lady -- how long? Remember your people, and show us your salvation!"

2019-05-16 at 07:11:34: What does he want *me* to do? Take better care of myself? Take up a cross and burn myself out on it? Fight the oppressor? Love my friends family and partners more deeply? Pray more? Waste less time praying and more time doing? Focus on my family? Fight for the whole world?

2019-05-16 at 07:11:33: Would he ride into Washington DC in the back of a donkey? Would he go to the Alabama statehouse and start flipping tables? Would he call some new disciples? To do what? Would he go around curing the sick, healing the wounded in body and mind and heart?

2019-05-16 at 07:11:32: I want you but I don't know how to find you, I don't know what kind of person you were, other than a good one. What *would* Jesus do? I've been studying him all my life and I have *no* idea. He'd pray, sure, and he'd love. But he wasn't a monk. He *did* things. But what now?

2019-05-16 at 07:11:32: I really do hope we're at the end times. It means Jesus would be coming back. Jesus, the one who embodies love and reason and righteous anger, who knows Godde will fight for us and knows how to get Her to actually do it. We need a Messiah right now.

2019-05-16 at 07:11:31: What could possibly change things? What could save us? Love is worth fighting to protect but it doesn't feel like a force in the fight anymore. What has broken love? How do we fix it? What else should we look toward? Reason? Righteous anger? A messianic figure?

2019-05-16 at 07:11:31: I'm lying here next to one of my wonderful partners, and I love her so much, but love has never felt so trite, so feeble, in the face of hatred and greed. Love used to be my North Star. I still believe in Love, I love Love and I seek and respect it. But it seems powerless.

2019-05-16 at 07:11:30: I'm tired of only seeing the Divine in flowers and birds -- which are fading from the world. I want to see it in people, in events, in communities, in victories for justice and liberation and love. I want to see the Divine in something that's actually growing and triumphing.

2019-05-16 at 07:11:30: It feels like there all the world's magic has fled somewhere we cannot find it. We need it back. We need signs, miracles, and wonders. We need to see the goodness and beauty of this world actually win something big and important.

2019-05-16 at 07:11:29: Where is that energy now, Godde? Why can't you help us? Why won't you help us? Is it our free will? Fuck our free will, we are dying, physically and spiritually. Is it almost the end time? Hurry up then, there's suffering while you delay.

2019-05-16 at 07:11:29: Where is Godde in all this? I was reading the Quran, Ibrahim, and I was struck by the line about sending Moses and his signs (miracles/wonders). Like, remember when you have signs that you cared about us? Remember when you split the veil of heaven to comfort and save us?

2019-05-16 at 07:11:28: How are we ever, ever going to solve economic inequality? Even starting a revolution seems impossible, making sure it ends with liberation for all and power for the oppressed seems like a damn fairy tale. All these big issues. Feels so hopeless.

2019-05-16 at 07:11:28: And I guess a lot of it is feeling the pain of the Earth? We're ruining the planet, and if abortion is so complicated, how the hell are we gonna talk about climate change? How will we convince people not just to tackle the problem but to protect the most vulnerable?

2019-05-16 at 07:11:28: Idk this is a very loose rant into the void. I'm often writing with an audience in mind but this one's really for me. I just feel very lost. I actually feel better about life on some levels than I have in months. But in some ways I'm more pained than I've been since Nov 2016.

2019-05-16 at 07:11:27: My spiritual side has never felt more repressed and I know *many* spiritual people going through the same thing. Maybe it's the heavens? I wish I knew astrology better. Or shittiness of the world? But so many find more connection then. Idk. That spiritual escape would be great.

2019-05-16 at 07:11:27: My codependent ass just wants to escape into a new romance and/or a TON of kink. A great book/game would be good too but I'm picky and that costs money. Too few escapes are free. Skateboarding helps but I can't do a ton of it because I only have so much leg stamina and daylight.

2019-05-15 at 08:32:04: Idk maybe it's just a manifestation of unnecessary guilt on my part but solidarity among trans people of all genders is really *really* important to me and to see it elided by her was shocking even though it was actually a fairly understandable mistake.

2019-01-28 at 20:19:34: It also shows that a community can have a limit on what it can tolerate -- and that tends to be homophobes, racists, and alt-right activists. Their lack of tolerance just flat out isn't tolerated: if you can't be peaceful and mind your own business, you aren't welcome.

2019-01-28 at 20:19:34: There are people like McMurray whose efforts fail (he's a homophobe trying to grapple with the reality that gays are here to stay) but then we also see stuff like the back-alley junkies and the local gay-but-very-conservative pastor dancing together in said alley.

2019-01-28 at 20:19:34: The people of Letterkenny are on the whole pretty conservative (excepts Squirrelly Dan the wokes hick) but they all honestly try and often actually *succeed* to be not just tolerant but even to understand the lives of people very different from them.

2019-01-28 at 20:19:33: Letterkenny is such a wholesome show. For me it shows a reality that p much can't (and probably shouldn't) exist in America right now: liberal and conservative, privileged and oppressed, celebrated and marginalized all right next to each other, not just coexisting but cooperating

2019-01-24 at 15:07:12: Fwiw, I am not toxic and dangerous. We all have flaws and wounds that can hurt others. Mine are no more harmful. I'm not the greatest friend, lover, or partner, but if you can put up with my shortcomings I can be a damn good one.

2019-01-24 at 14:58:41: I have calmed down but unlike usual I don't exactly regret my Twitter outbursts last night. It wasn't completely rational but it was some great emotional processing.

2019-01-24 at 05:38:59: This thread was actually some useful processing. Thanks for indulging me.

2019-01-24 at 05:38:59: How many times have I inflicted my own wounds onto others? I know I can be a powerful force in people's lives... And then one day I'm just gone. How do I stop doing it without just becoming a hermit? And is this even the result of some repressed trauma, or is this just who I am?

2019-01-24 at 05:38:59: I've been pining for more romance and connection lately, but it feels so selfish, because I know that I'll just take it back someday, drawing myself inward and leaving the usually-codependent people I tend to fall for alone without what I know is a powerful emotional support.

2019-01-24 at 05:38:58: I know that there is a general feeling of abandonment and rejection in this dark mass, and I have definitely mirrored that behavior. Even the ones I haven't fled from permanently, I'll disappear for weeks and then come back like nothing happened -- or worse, brimming with guilt.

2019-01-24 at 05:38:57: I don't know how to tell my story without seeing this trail of people I've let down, hurt, and abandoned. I have ghosted out of so many lives, quite possibly reinflicting some of my buried emotional wounds into others for reasons I can't even get a handle on.

2019-01-24 at 05:38:57: Kinda sorta "I will let you down, I will make you hurt." It just feels like, given enough time, I will *always* bring more pain than love into someone's life. It's hard not to get Ideas when you think like that.

2019-01-24 at 05:38:57: And also my codependent ass focuses a lot on how this psychological state is volatile, confusing, and potentially harmful. It feels like my best choice is solitude, and that every friend, lover, partner is a dangerous concession.

2019-01-24 at 05:38:56: I just... I want it out. I want it ripped out. I want to know what the fuck is living down there and how I can help it heal, understand why it's hurting me so much. Or I just want it gone, ejected from me like something rotten.

2019-01-24 at 05:38:56: And whatever this thing I'm clenched around is, it feels toxic. It makes me feel dangerous and damaging. It makes me want to isolate myself so that I don't hurt the people I love, and so they don't hurt me. It makes me worried to feel deep emotion, because it lives in the depths.

2019-01-24 at 05:38:56: I still want to sob, and I still can't, so I'm venting instead. There is something clenched down so hard, so afraid to let it out, and I feel like it must be a part of this big blank hurt inside me.

2019-01-24 at 05:38:55: I will probably never know what happened to me, or even know that it happened there, or if it even happened at all. My repression skills are top-notch. But, it seems like I see the echoes of it everywhere in the chaotic realm that is my emotional state, and I hate it.

2019-01-24 at 05:38:55: It also doesn't help when I know there are wounds in me that I don't understand. I went down a rabbit-hole doing research on a school that I briefly went to. There was, unsurprisingly to me, a culture there that enabled and covered up abuse (2 known priests, who knows who else?).

2019-01-24 at 04:06:42: (this metaphor brought to you by working for Amazon and carrying like 12 jiffies at once with just one arm.)

2019-01-24 at 04:06:42: It can be really hard to know how exactly to make the pile work. I can get caught in black-and-white thinking: I have a tendency to focus on how I'm holding things, assuming it's something I'm doing wrong. Sometimes I fight that and focus just on the pile. Hard for me to do both.

2019-01-24 at 04:06:41: And sometimes I the pile gets jostled and I'll realize that it had been resting on my arm wrong, straining my wrists. Sometimes things just need rearranging, sometimes I need to put something down, and sometimes I'm just holding it wrong.

2019-01-24 at 04:06:41: Being me often feels like trying to carry too much stuff in my hands, and I keep dropping stuff and having to stop to pick it up, and the pile I'm carrying gets all mixed up and I forget what all's even in there.

2019-01-18 at 04:45:09: All the dorm-room hangouts, all the hotboxing, all the growth, all the music, all the support we gave each other. Late nights in the library, later nights at that house. The three of us were wonderful, and I'll always treasure that.

2019-01-18 at 04:45:09: It's so much harder for them though, honestly, I'd imagine. I'm so glad they have each other. I wish I could give them what they want. I wish I could explain why I can't. But I think I'll just have to be grateful for all the cherished memories.

2019-01-18 at 04:45:07: I want desperately to reconcile, but I'm pretty sure we never will. And that hurts. A lot. And I need to let myself feel that pain rather than running from it, but I also can't let it rule my life. I've got to stop feeling it in drips and drabs, I need to let it out of me.

2019-01-18 at 04:45:06: I'm trying to use music to help loosen my heart.

2018-09-15 at 17:25:29: Being broke sucks. I apply to at least one job every day, and so far no interviews. I know it's kinda just a matter of time and persistence but in the meantime I'm sitting around with too little to do and too much time on my hands.

2018-08-31 at 20:36:00: This has been a very hard decision made very suddenly. While my community loves and supports me, my stepping away is going to be an extra challenge for those still living and volunteering in the House. If you've ever thought about getting involved, now would be a great time.

2018-08-31 at 20:36:00: I'm moving in with my lovely girlfriends Gwyn and Pelle, who have been so supportive of all my efforts to stay afloat and have also been so supportive of my decision to get out of the deep end. As I start a new chapter of my life, I'm glad I get to do it with them and not alone.

2018-08-31 at 20:35:59: I'm so grateful for this past year, I've grown so much and I've gotten to do so much good supporting people in bad situations. I want to remain a part of the House (mainly through continuing to volunteer at Brunch), but I need to step back and take care of my mental health.

If you give more than I make in a year, that just means you have more than me to give. The widow's one coin was worth more than your entire annual income.

2018-04-10 at 15:05:07: @Poppysgrandkids @MsPackyetti @we_built_this Mt 20:1-16 is literally -- LITERALLY -- about how our reward is based not on our labor but on God's love and generosity for each individual no matter how much work they do.

(Btw they definitely never told me or any white person to use that slur)

2018-03-08 at 19:29:48: @GrumpyCatterman @TullamoreDEWUS Well yes I am but literally all white people have been brainwashed by our society's reinforcement of white supremacy, there is always the danger of taking a paternalistic attitude in dismantling the effects of racism on people of color which is why I try to follow the cues of POC

2018-03-08 at 19:22:54: @GrumpyCatterman @TullamoreDEWUS People of color is the phrase that my black and brown siblings have recommended I use.

2018-02-20 at 06:04:40: My crush put on facial hair today and O M G H E L P M E

They are hot no matter where on the spectrum they present :3

2018-02-19 at 17:39:21: Anyway, I love her, and I'm grateful for her, and I'm so grateful that she sacrificed our relationship and took on a lot of loneliness and guilt to let me grow. She's given me so much. The Divinity within me recognizes the Divinity within the prophet Megan Felix.

2018-02-19 at 17:39:20: She promised to be there for me through all my changes and growth. And while she hasn't been there romantically, she's been my housemate and co-worker and friend despite all the pain it's brought her, and she facilitated my growth in an incredible way at great cost to her.

2018-02-19 at 17:39:20: I never, ever thought I could forgive her for breaking her vow. Now I want to thank her. Now I see that, even though it's not how I wanted it to look, she didn't break her vow at all.

2018-02-19 at 17:39:19: So yes it hurt me so much, but I'm no longer angry I'm grateful. We're best friends, and now I'm in a place where I'm not friends with her *despite* our divorce, it's actually a part of why I'm grateful for her.

2018-02-19 at 17:39:19: And now because I've had to rely on myself I've found depths of beauty and power that surprise me. I am so proud of who I am right now, if who I'm becoming.

2018-02-19 at 17:39:18: She knew it was what I needed. And she knew I wouldn't see that at first, and might not ever. She knew she might lose one of her best friends. She knew she'd miss our romance and feel guilty for ending it. But she knew we both needed it so she did it anyway.

2018-02-19 at 17:39:18: I don't know how I feel about the romance itself anymore -- whether I miss it or whether it's just a good thing I wouldn't care to revisit. But I know Megan gave up a lot and hurt herself a lot, and while yes it freed her from some of my shit she also loved me when she did it.

2018-02-19 at 17:39:18: Our relationship had problems, but it was beautiful. I'm not grateful for it like she killed some abomination. She hurt herself a lot in the process, and it allowed me to grow in some remarkable ways. If we had stayed together I wouldn't be the amazing woman I'm becoming.

2018-02-19 at 17:39:17: I've gotten to the point where I'm actually grateful that Megan ended our romantic partnership yet still am grateful for what we had. I never thought I'd feel that way.

2017-04-15 at 20:12:00: I already think I'm a mess, it's shitty to know that I'm seen as such a mess I can't just be accepted, I must be helped or prodded.

2015-08-20 at 07:41:18: @hankgreen @xgalaxyhoran You tell them "Don't want to do X" instead of just saying "Don't do X"

2015-08-20 at 07:40:58: @hankgreen @xgalaxyhoran "Nolere" is a verb that literally means, "To not want," so when you tell people in Latin not to do something,

2015-08-20 at 07:40:21: @hankgreen @xgalaxyhoran For the "just" I'd probably go with "Noli(te) solius deficere," which literally means "Solely don't fail."

2012-03-31 at 20:30:18: @Sheesh_Queesh Salaam is just Arabic for "peace"; 'blessed are the peacemakers," or so I'm told, so isn't saying salaam blessed?

2012-03-31 at 20:27:30: @SnowBunny_x33 Even Simon Peter and the apostles fled Jesus's cross, and Paul admitted to sinning daily. Is St. Paul not Christian?

2012-03-31 at 20:25:36: @taylormcneeley I don't remember anywhere in the Bible where Jesus says, "If you do something wrong, don't pray to me to forgive you!"

2012-03-31 at 20:22:12: @LILCBASEDJESUS Orthodox Christians don't have any concept of kneeling in prayer in their entire 2,000 y/o history. Still Christians.

2012-03-31 at 20:21:06: @thecakeisfat So God will only forgive people if they're good? What about the prodigal son? Isn't mercy a gift, not a reward?

2012-03-31 at 20:20:05: @MicahBerteau Some people consider the Bible to holy to scratch on -- I'm not one of those people, but they're certainly still Christians.

2012-03-31 at 20:19:31: @iHateSJD So you're saying that since the prodigal son was bad to his dad, he shouldn't have begged for forgiveness later?

2010-07-16 at 05:09:23: --S-o-m-e-- Most days, I have no idea if I'm doing *anything* right.

2010-07-15 at 18:53:04: Phone not working. AC not working, thus compounding sleep problems. Wanted to get up and run w/ team today. No motivation.

2010-07-14 at 20:19:05: @lemontartsunite D:

2010-07-14 at 16:50:52: I agree w/ @goosedork: it's not the tweeting that upsets me, it's that I wish I could help you not be depressed.

2010-07-14 at 03:37:08: @TheShyRetirer I can't decide whether that's sincere or snarky. I actually think it's both.

2010-07-14 at 03:13:38: A/C hasn't been on for three days. I'm now ready to complain about it.

2010-07-14 at 01:00:00: @lemontartsunite /I/ get bruises on my hips from wearing pants sometimes, and I'm a skinny male!

2010-07-14 at 00:55:15: Just realized why I've had a hearing problem for the last semester+Summer.

2010-07-13 at 04:10:52: @mariorules25 Well, I know this might seem simplistic, but how's your diet and exercise regimen been?

2010-07-13 at 02:40:48: @dylanisnotamyth w00t!

2010-07-12 at 23:10:53: @mariorules The Papal residence is at 4562 Varrelmann Ave., right?

2010-07-12 at 23:05:11: @mariorules25 Where's the Papal residence?

2010-07-12 at 06:45:00: @damnfan I know a chick named Rose. . . she's my four-year-old cousin though, so I won't hit that.

2010-07-12 at 06:36:57: @damnfan With whom?

2010-07-12 at 06:23:18: @damnfan No, and I'm starting to get impatient.

2010-07-12 at 06:06:35: Trying to remember everyone with whom you've conversed on a particular topic can be difficult.

2010-07-09 at 05:44:47: Shitty

2010-07-08 at 18:21:50: Slept for 14 hrs. . . this is getting stupid. My sleep cycle is stupid.

2010-07-06 at 16:13:14: Senior pictures today. I've got to find the wrinkling creme and the powder-wig and the walker.

2010-06-14 at 03:02:56: @dylanisnotamyth Eating five small/medium meals a day filled with healthiness (including meat, optimally) will make you feel better.

2010-06-02 at 00:58:54: would a libertarian say it's OK for a pvt. biz. owner to bar a customer with a gun from their biz? Or is that how black holes are made?

2010-06-01 at 18:11:29: @jmentalcase That'd be awesome 'cause I can't go w/ the date it's on. Don't fix it just for me, but (and this is selfish) I hope it'll rain.

2010-05-28 at 04:15:04: @damnfan We know, Smon. And I agree: I'm just giving you shit. Tell Seamus to go put a dick in his mouth.

2010-05-28 at 04:07:54: @damnfan By that logic the crucifixion was bad; but according to us, it was a pretty Good Friday.

2010-05-27 at 04:20:09: @mariorules25 O shit, I just remembered that you'd txtd me while I was takin Tor home.

2010-05-27 at 03:44:15: @xofconfomity Now I obviously have no bias even though literally everyone in my family went there, but you should consider Rockhurst ;P jk

2010-05-26 at 04:12:13: @mariorules25 Also why not do all three at the same time?

2010-05-26 at 04:11:58: @mariorules25 I actually want you to pick up your wiener to talk with me.

2010-05-26 at 04:07:14: @mariorules25 I was going to earlier, actually, but then Tori called. I would now, but I'm too damn tired to talk with people.

2010-05-26 at 04:03:26: Today has been so shitty. . . I hope tomorrow's better.

2010-05-19 at 05:24:28: @disaynay My phone was off anyway, but if I hadn't been asleep than I would've liked that.

2010-05-19 at 05:17:42: I had a headache when I got home, so I slept 'til 9. Now I'm gonna be up all night!

2010-05-18 at 02:24:01: @dylanisnotamyth He will possess your grades.

2010-05-17 at 21:02:55: Low on light, low on sun, low on food, low on sleep, low on friends, low on cash -- low on life.

2010-05-17 at 08:13:38: @damnfan Oh, okay. You have my prayers instead, then. Glad I could talk; you cheered me up too. G'night!

2010-05-17 at 08:05:40: @damnfan Sorry Simon :( I'll talk to you later. If you're not feeling better after-school tomorrow I'll pay a sick visit, k?

2010-05-17 at 06:58:57: @damnfan Are you up this late because you're depressed also? Is there anything I can do to help? Do you want to call me? Prayers any way.

2010-05-17 at 02:45:03: @dylanisnotamyth That really sucks :(

2010-05-16 at 23:49:58: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-05-16 at 23:49:14: So I feel a little better now that Tor's here. . .

2010-05-16 at 20:27:26: I suddenly feel really down. . .

2010-05-16 at 17:26:54: @xofconformity Forreal though good luck.

2010-05-16 at 17:26:41: @xofconformity That's my favorite game! It's a good thing that you, like me, are a turtle-neck fanatic!

2010-05-15 at 20:29:31: Just to let you know, the parade that wasn't scheduled for this Sunday is canceled.

2010-05-15 at 17:23:40: I was on the same road as @jmentalcase's cabin a few minutes ago :)

2010-05-15 at 03:52:27: @damnfan Either at their own house or in Chicago, mostly.

2010-05-15 at 00:50:12: It's working! #pingpong #pavspopcap

2010-05-15 at 00:39:12: Prayers for Penny Arcade as they take on their rivals in Ping-Poing #pavspopcap

2010-05-14 at 03:11:26: @damnfan I surrender. Well played.

2010-05-14 at 03:08:13: @damnfan Heh; little do you know that I am the Chief Executive Officer of Head Up Asshole, Inc.

2010-05-14 at 02:51:14: @xofconformity I'm good at arrogant. Also, I was exaggerating everything anyway, so I didn't mean it.

2010-05-14 at 02:43:52: @mariorules25 Me and Simon (of all people) -- defend the women. You -- ignore everyone but DV who, of all people, is attacking them :P

2010-05-14 at 02:33:27: @mariorules25 It's really just a "let's watch movies" club, but spun in a way that Rosati's admin. likes it.

2010-05-13 at 22:51:07: RT @church_fathers: "If you believe what you like in the gospels, and reject what you don‚Äôt, it's not the gospel you believe, but yourself."

2010-05-13 at 03:45:14: @xofconformity Who is that attractive man in your pic?

2010-05-12 at 03:50:02: @disaynay I just think he'll be pleased if you do anything.

2010-05-12 at 03:41:04: @TheShyRetirer this realization hurts. It will hurt alot more when we are 38.

2010-05-12 at 03:19:17: @spensluh222 Probably because James realized he'd invited @xofconformity

2010-05-12 at 03:13:23: @xofconformity No. . . Maybe he likes you :)

2010-05-12 at 02:55:37: Do we need to wear a jacket tomorrow?

2010-05-12 at 01:32:39: @jmentalcase Yeah that's what I'm doing. Still. . . I just want to senior-out of the year.

2010-05-12 at 00:31:15: Do not want to write this paper.

2010-05-12 at 00:18:28: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-05-11 at 05:45:07: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-05-11 at 05:11:01: Tori's staying at my house for the rest of the week.

2010-05-11 at 05:10:39: @damnfan If I knew, I might agree.

2010-05-10 at 04:49:18: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-05-10 at 04:08:37: Update: 10 full days, 1 Mass day, 1 half-day, 3 exam days left. Work left to do: PH, APExam & Relativity; TH, essay; EN, rdg; HI, paper

2010-05-10 at 04:02:04: ugh my parents are frustrating sometimes. . .

2010-05-10 at 00:14:42: The Prostitute has a hose leaking coolant and the radiator fans aren't working.

2010-05-10 at 00:14:14: @damnfan No, there's no way it could've been her, and even if I were evil, it still wouldn't be worth trying to peg her with that.

2010-05-10 at 00:13:09: Car = broken.

2010-05-08 at 19:59:26: @FalkonFace 11:30pm-8:30am, 10:00am-Noon.

2010-05-08 at 19:29:56: Had an AWESOME night last night! Wish I could've come back afterwards, but still -- I love my friends!

2010-05-07 at 04:37:48: @damnfan you are the superior person. That's why you can take his shit.

2010-05-07 at 04:31:22: @damnfan Yeah, when people are inferior in some manner, their only defense is usually to claim otherwise.

2010-05-07 at 04:27:37: @damnfan Your dad is very rational and fair. /sarcasm

2010-05-07 at 02:46:58: @natsuotaost would that be :D :D :D or TTT___TTT

2010-05-07 at 02:46:30: @dylanisnotamyth Plz keep reading. I promise you the Chaplain's situation gets better (in one way or another. . . read on to find out).

2010-05-07 at 02:21:29: @mariorules25 You're bein mean :P

2010-05-07 at 02:13:14: @mariorules25 This mentality = makes me want to shoot people.

2010-05-07 at 00:39:14: My Legend of Dragoon save file got wiped somehow :(

2010-05-06 at 19:32:29: Had no classes today.

2010-05-06 at 04:25:10: @disaynay Oh yeah, your bro's a different story than your parents.

2010-05-06 at 04:18:39: @disaynay Find you like that.

2010-05-06 at 04:17:44: @disaynay Just let 'em?

2010-05-06 at 03:45:41: @KarlDoofWebster I've been told by my mother (who works for SLU), my counselor, Mr. Curdt, and a coll. adm. counselor that they do.

2010-05-05 at 04:04:19: @KarlDoofWebster That's the most false and terrible advice I've ever heard you give someone. They definitely do pay attention!

2010-05-05 at 01:30:19: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-05-05 at 01:14:11: @xofconformity I'll ask if we have one that would fit a giant. Dad's clothes are more likely to fit you than me.

2010-05-04 at 06:21:50: I don't want to go to sleep, but I don't want to wake up tired.

2010-05-04 at 04:13:17: @jmentalcase Sciuto due tomorrow, Wednesday's meh, Thurs. AP ENGLISH (OH GOD; JESUS HELP ME), then Friday should be good./annoying.

2010-05-04 at 03:37:30: #2010 Weird.

2010-05-03 at 23:34:46: @disaynay That wouldn't be statutory rape, fyi. He has to be older than 21 AND you be younger than 17.

2010-05-03 at 16:15:22: @FalkonFace Weddings + Forced to go to them = Suck. Weddings + Want to go = The Roxorz.

2010-05-03 at 16:14:48: @Jmentalcase Ha, but hey: The tub's one of the safest places to be during a tornado.

2010-05-03 at 16:00:44: Heh, 1st Monday + Lots of Tornadoes recently = AHH!!!

2010-05-02 at 21:40:46: @dylanisnotamyth DV's in KC right now :/ But his house is the one to the right of the house with the Irish flag on it.

2010-05-02 at 06:08:33: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-05-02 at 05:52:24: @mariorules25 We never get paid back for our good deeds. Look what happened to big J. . . Sorry we missed ya today; at Affton's musical?

2010-05-01 at 19:40:32: @archstl Just out of curiosity, who is the normal tweeter for ArchStl?

2010-05-01 at 19:23:22: @damnfan DAMN, FAN! I've got AT&T.

2010-05-01 at 19:10:01: @xofconformity I wish they'd screw up more often. That was ridiculous.

2010-05-01 at 18:56:28: OMG I just downloaded 1.8MB of data near-instantaneously!

2010-05-01 at 16:30:43: @damnfan That's why I don't normally get haircuts.

2010-05-01 at 04:30:20: @spensluh222 Nvm, Simon's gonna be in Rome on holiday.

2010-05-01 at 04:08:37: @spensluh222 If it's at Simon's, I can get it back to you tomorrow. I'm gonna be down there tomorrow evening.

2010-05-01 at 04:08:04: @KarlDoofWebster True. They still look really dumb, though.

2010-05-01 at 03:51:27: @KarlDoofWebster And yet, our Bible seems to suggest it's already ending too.

2010-05-01 at 03:39:42: Oh my God. Tom DePriest is dating Emma. What the fuck is our world coming to?

2010-05-01 at 03:29:53: I wish I hadn't had to leave. . . now I'm just gonna be alone 'til Tuesday.

2010-04-30 at 04:12:18: Feeling like I'm gonna just cry.

2010-04-30 at 04:07:11: @damnfan Might be the saddest part in the whole book, idk. It's just so damn surprising :(

2010-04-29 at 04:56:07: Wow, something must be wrong w/ me. I was listening to Dogs, and I just stopped it 'cause I thought, "This is just trite and stupid."

2010-04-29 at 04:32:23: @karl You're welcome. Glad I could help.

2010-04-29 at 04:21:12: @Karl I think if you google "Naomi loved Ruth" and look for an appropriate page, you'd find it.

2010-04-29 at 04:20:44: @Karl And there's one other that I found compelling (though I don't find any of these /super/ convincing in themselbes), I forget though

2010-04-29 at 04:19:48: @KarlDoofWebster Jesus and the Centurion (Mt 7,28; 8, 5-13; Lk 7, 1-10). Thethoughtthere is that the greek word "slave" has double meanings.

2010-04-29 at 04:16:31: @KarlDoofWebster Oh those. Um. . . Somwhere in Ruth (Ruth loved Naomi like she did [guy's name]. . . (cont'd)

2010-04-29 at 04:08:27: @KarlDoofWebster I'm flattered, go ahead.

2010-04-29 at 03:54:22: @dylanisnotamyth I know :( This book is really starting to get to me.

2010-04-29 at 02:55:43: @xofconformity Karl would like to express his dissatisfaction at your use of "gay" as a pejorative descriptor. I lightly concur.

2010-04-29 at 01:22:14: @damnfan I was gonna say that. Your reply to @tristasjoy, not your tweet. Idk what's so awesome about next week.

2010-04-29 at 01:13:19: @tristasjoy You expecting?

2010-04-29 at 01:06:55: @TRISTASJOY YES!!! BULLS, HERE I COME

2010-04-28 at 04:24:43: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-04-27 at 04:59:33: Happy Tuesday everyone!

2010-04-27 at 04:58:40: @mariorules25 I love being a #sheep too!

2010-04-27 at 03:53:14: @spensluh222 Hey, instead of buying me Jr. Ring tickets, how about buying me lunch tomorrow? Heh. &gt;_&gt;

2010-04-27 at 03:21:36: @damnfan Penisism*

2010-04-27 at 03:20:31: I've really missed you guys :/

2010-04-27 at 02:56:58: @xofconformity @damnfan I'm rebelling against the healthy norm.

2010-04-27 at 02:45:24: @damnfan YES, I'M A REVOLUTIONIST *DIPDIPDIP*

2010-04-27 at 02:41:16: @xofconformity We would know, right? XP

2010-04-27 at 02:38:40: @xofconformity Me too :) Funny book, sort of eye-opening.

2010-04-26 at 09:12:32: @dylanlouis @jmentalcase @karldoofwebster How are you guys doin'?

2010-04-26 at 09:11:55: Missing one more day of school. Gonna be super-bored and super-lonely, but I'm just not quite feeling up to it.

2010-04-26 at 07:51:33: Feeling much better! My stomach's still rejecting food, though :/

2010-04-26 at 07:47:54: @mariorules25 I liked CitR :/ And C22 is amazing! Honestly, Idk if I've disliked any of the books we've read for English. . .

2010-04-25 at 04:48:18: @xofconformity Did you mean to mention @falkonface? 'Cause I didn't even do "signif" on purpose.

2010-04-25 at 04:32:36: The only thing I've done in the last 3 days is read, do HW, talk with a priest, some communion-stuff, play #LegendOfDragoon. Nothing signif.

2010-04-25 at 04:29:03: @xofconformity Me too. It's a real treat when we do interact, though.

2010-04-25 at 03:16:11: @xofconformity LOL. Yeah, that's one of the reaons I don't liike Webassign.

2010-04-25 at 03:11:53: @jmentalcase @dylanlouis I wish I could visit you and Ryan. I hope we're all doing better soon.

2010-04-25 at 03:10:57: @xofconformity I posted it on Tumblr and on a Tweet that @mentioned you, lol. Put "700." Then it reads the right # of sig-figs.

2010-04-25 at 03:08:18: @jmentalcase EEK!

2010-04-25 at 03:08:00: @xofconformity @damnfan On Tumblr. He put "700" instead of "700."

2010-04-25 at 03:03:56: @jmentalcase So what's wrong wit' ya? #plagueofstlouis'10

2010-04-25 at 03:02:16: @disanynay #danielfhoefel went home after his Melee tourney.

2010-04-25 at 02:59:43: I'm FB chatting with #danielhoefel

2010-04-25 at 02:58:25: @falkonface That's a really good score independent of how I did.

2010-04-25 at 02:51:43: @falkonface That's really fuckin' awesome! That's a fantastic score, congratulations!

2010-04-25 at 02:49:57: @falkonface I'm probably not going to anyway. What was your score?

2010-04-24 at 21:51:32: @tristasjoy the #tornadoalerms are fun. It stopped pouring as much up here just now.

2010-04-24 at 19:05:43: Why did I ever get contacts? I like the way I look w/ glasses better, and then I could see right now.

2010-04-24 at 17:43:03: @lemontartsunite LOL

2010-04-24 at 17:42:54: @karldoofwebster I didn't even know you'd gotten sick!

2010-04-24 at 17:13:49: Maybe /all/ my friends is an exaggeration. . . still feel bad for @dylanisnotamyth

2010-04-24 at 17:13:15: @damnfan I mean, are you guys sure you're feeling okay? 'Cause I could've had strep for a week, I could've spread it anytime this week.

2010-04-24 at 17:12:35: @jmentalcase Oh. . . What's up with you, dude? @damnfan That's also good, yeah.

2010-04-24 at 16:47:10: @jmentalcase DAMMIT, now I feel like a huge asshole. I'm getting all my friends sick -- stupid, of course that's not allergies! :(

2010-04-24 at 04:19:10: Hope he sees anyone tomorrow. . . not going to Certamen :/

2010-04-24 at 04:05:58: @disaynay What were you talking about with me and @jmentalcase?

2010-04-24 at 02:22:09: @disaynay ?

2010-04-24 at 01:55:43: @damnfan LOL

2010-04-24 at 00:29:40: @damnfan He brought me Communion.  And thank you Mr P! I'm trying; feeling a little better :) Thank all of you for being good caring friends

2010-04-24 at 00:23:00: @dylanisnotamyth I've been super-bored and feeling super-dirty today. Sick=Suck. I'd come visit you if I weren't sick too.

2010-04-24 at 00:18:38: Fr. Houser came to my house, we chatted for an hour and a half. Very productive; what a holy man. He's being transferred to Rome in July :(

2010-04-23 at 23:58:22: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-04-23 at 20:30:23: @dylanisnotamyth Same: better, kinda. My eye looks a lot better now that I went and got some medicine from my doctor.

2010-04-23 at 20:14:34: @dylanisnotamyth How are you feeling?

2010-04-23 at 19:37:13: Very bored, slightly lonely. Wishing I could actually see (pinkeye=me-contacts). Waiting for my one visitor of the day. Praying for Mr. King

2010-04-23 at 13:28:32: Does anyone have a tape-to-digital converter?

2010-04-23 at 12:14:00: @mariorules25 I'd go if I weren't sick. But I since I am, my mom took my car to work, so I couldn't drive down there.

2010-04-23 at 12:12:08: @dylanisnotamyth O____T

2010-04-23 at 05:20:04: @mariorules25 I only assumed it was Willie because we're in Theo. together and we just got done watching a video that ended with that query

2010-04-23 at 04:34:37: @dylanisnotamyth I am planning on going down to SoCi for Mass again this Saturday, though. So if not tomorrow, maybe ghosts then?

2010-04-23 at 04:26:37: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-04-23 at 04:00:54: @disaynay I really am kind of sick though :/ I'd love to hang out in the South -- I want to live in the South, really. Alas. . .

2010-04-23 at 03:51:01: @dylanisnotamyth Though you probably have some idea of how much I'd love to hang out.

2010-04-23 at 03:50:42: @dylanisnotamyth Even if I get better, my mom's stealing my car and I'm not going to school tomorrow.

2010-04-22 at 23:22:14: @jmentalcase YES. We will film excellence on that camera, including the first full-body apparition on camera!

2010-04-22 at 22:51:02: Teenagers are stuck in a constant state of comfortability.

2010-04-22 at 22:42:18: RT @dylanisnotamyth I hate being at home [(especially when I'm sick)]

2010-04-22 at 22:18:16: @dylanlouis Okay. I'm really sorry if I got you sick though. I'm not the only one who could've given it to you, but still &gt;_&gt;

2010-04-22 at 22:03:13: Just a warning (@dylanlouis): I went home sick today. I probably have strep throat and pink eye. Be alert; it's spreading, you could have it

2010-04-21 at 09:06:44: Please pray for me, guys.

2010-04-21 at 05:42:24: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-04-19 at 05:31:32: @TheShyRetirer OH, okay. /ego=deflated, but that's a good thing so don't apologize.

2010-04-19 at 05:24:52: @falkonface I'm sorry I missed you on FB; I had to go talk to Ma & Pa.

2010-04-19 at 05:23:30: @theshyretirer You just liked a post of mine from February!

2010-04-19 at 05:18:33: @theshyretirer Hey, I'm being stalked apparently xD

2010-04-19 at 04:52:13: @theshyretirer :)

2010-04-19 at 04:47:38: @theshyretirer I believe in a thing called love.

2010-04-19 at 04:02:20: @dylanisnotamyth Luciana?

2010-04-18 at 17:05:47: @LT_TheBIblegeek That's why you go to *Jesus's* house every morning and he makes you breakfast.

2010-04-18 at 04:53:44: @dylanisnotamyth would it help if I told you Ce$ha were naked in your house somewhere?

2010-04-17 at 18:26:15: Just saw Ronald McDonald.

2010-04-16 at 05:42:58: Had forgotten to switch his overhead fan from Winter "circulate warm air" mode to Summer "blow cold air" mode. Fix'd.

2010-04-16 at 05:09:30: @falkonface So like, Mustangs and disco and rainbows and peace signs and JFK all the time at your house, because of your sister?

2010-04-16 at 05:01:55: @falkonface We're used to it being a lot colder at night, in part.

2010-04-16 at 04:42:01: Saddest moment in C22 so far, imo, coming up tomorrow for you guys. No one dies or anything; it's small, but I found it really sad.

2010-04-16 at 02:09:28: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-04-16 at 01:47:41: @dylanisnotamyth It is a plan.

2010-04-16 at 01:47:12: @xofconformity I agree that that's more important; I don't think it has to come first. Just in general removing reasons to want to have one.

2010-04-16 at 01:25:51: Not saying I agree with the reasoning of RvW, just saying what the underlying logic suggests.

2010-04-16 at 01:25:12: @xofconformity Itt should be legal for the same reason abortion currently is: a right to privacy and choice as found in the 14th amendment.

2010-04-16 at 01:13:35: I need to know if anyone needs/wants me or my car tomorrow. In short: is anything going on?

2010-04-15 at 04:27:56: @dylanisnotamyth I'm a day ahead of you; it took me a lot of last night, before HR, HR, and a lot of my free period to read that section.

2010-04-14 at 04:29:15: @FalkonFace Me too. I was like, 2. Scared the /shit/ out of my parents, 'cause my normal temp is like 96, so +9 over normal. . . O_O

2010-04-14 at 04:06:58: My body temp. is 2degrees (98.2) above normal, I have a cough, and I feel really tired even though I slept for 5hrs. after I got home :/

2010-04-14 at 03:54:05: I will keep trying. He wants me to, and I enjoy it, even though I know I won't succeed.

2010-04-14 at 02:22:05: @disaynay couldn't* care less

2010-04-13 at 05:36:00: @carolimerose She pretty much summed up my favorite parts.

2010-04-13 at 04:10:42: @FalkonFace With, but that's not scored with the rest of it, is it? I *know* it's not with the SAT.

2010-04-13 at 04:08:47: @damnfan Switch your topic sentences. Done.

2010-04-13 at 03:59:36: @carolimerose ACT:33/36, SAT:2100/2400 (the scores are about equal)

2010-04-13 at 03:55:29: I don't think I'm going to take the ACT or SAT again. I'm happy w/ my scores.

2010-04-13 at 03:24:37: @damnfan I can't decide whether to ._. , &gt;_&gt;, T_T, or ;D

2010-04-09 at 04:03:39: @TheShyRetirer Yay.

2010-04-09 at 03:50:05: @TheShyRetirer okay :/

2010-04-09 at 03:20:40: @dylanisnotamyth LOL, best joke ever.

2010-04-09 at 00:20:42: @jmentalcase OOOH!!!

2010-04-08 at 05:01:53: @TheShyRetirer Cool. We'll talk more on Friday.

2010-04-08 at 04:53:26: @TheShyRetirer the only extra drive would be the one in the morning, and that's not too big a deal, no.

2010-04-08 at 04:46:31: @TheShyRetirer So it's no problem for me if you want.

2010-04-08 at 04:44:55: @TheShyRetirer I have a working oven. And, as I mentioned, not only am I going to your picnic, but also to a Liturgy in SoCi, (cont'd)

2010-04-08 at 04:06:56: Caritas, Intergritas. . . better yet: amare, tenere.  Our principles will strangle us.

2010-04-08 at 03:50:25: @mariorules25 I always like to remember that whenever Elise is tweeting a 80tps, I can just say, "off disanya."

2010-04-08 at 02:21:42: @jmentalcase :(

2010-04-07 at 05:18:43: When you stay up at late at night, stuck in your own head unable to get it, do you think of me? I need to think of you more. Ur great help.

2010-04-06 at 04:19:54: @jmentalcase &gt;___&lt;

2010-04-06 at 04:19:41: @damnfan ;_;

2010-04-06 at 04:08:07: @jmentalcase Post or it didn't happen.

2010-04-06 at 03:43:48: Za-chary*

2010-04-06 at 03:43:38: She's Zach-ary's age.

2010-04-06 at 03:43:22: Anyone have a copy of FFVII they'd be willing to loan my sister? I'd take full responsibility if she broke it.

2010-04-06 at 02:32:56: @dylanisnotamyth D: *hug*

2010-04-06 at 01:29:26: @dylanisnotamyth Thanks :)

2010-04-06 at 01:23:08: @dylanisnotamyth what's the old schedule?

2010-04-06 at 00:39:16: @tristasjoy NOW I'll lol

2010-04-06 at 00:33:41: @mariorules25 I'd lol if I weren't often guilty of the same thing.

2010-04-06 at 00:04:02: @xofconformity sudo chown -hR [username] [path directory to external]

2010-04-05 at 23:58:40: @xofconformity Idk if that'll fix your problem, but that's the one you want.

2010-04-05 at 23:58:24: @xofconformity ext3

2010-04-05 at 23:50:46: @xofconformity OH JESUS D: My friend, you may have the ride you request. Spring Break + No Car = OMG :(

2010-04-05 at 23:35:27: @xofconformity Max &/or Simon to the rescue?

2010-04-05 at 22:26:34: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-04-05 at 20:59:33: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHaVUjjH3EI&feature=player_embedded Funny video about Leviticus from "The West Wing."

2010-04-05 at 20:41:44: Props to Rocco Palmo at whispersintheloggia.blogspot.com; arguably the best reporting on Catholicism period. #catholicnews

2010-04-05 at 06:09:43: No more thunder :(

2010-04-05 at 06:03:26: @nicepalpal School resumes on Tuesday.

2010-04-05 at 05:53:48: @disanya @falkonface @lalarnia @theshyretirer Ladies and gentlemen, I salute you.

2010-04-05 at 05:48:35: ROLL CALL! Who's still up?

2010-04-05 at 05:21:54: THAT ONE WAS BRIGHT, DAMN

2010-04-05 at 05:20:00: @spensluh222 Us three should get together right now and do awesomeness. . . The fact that it's midnight precludes that option, though.

2010-04-05 at 05:19:00: Me too :/ RT @dylanisnotamyth I cant sleep because i'm too busy mind fucking myself and listening to the storm.

2010-04-05 at 04:13:42: Dammit, why do I have to choose? Church or Children hardly seems like a real dichotomy. If only I were Orthodox :/

2010-04-05 at 04:13:05: @dylanisnotamyth I live for thunderstorms. It's my favorite thing about Spring.

2010-04-05 at 04:08:18: THUNDERSTORM'S ROLLING INTO NOCO FTW

2010-04-05 at 03:07:55: SLUH STUDENTS HEADS-UP: SPECIAL SCHEDULE TUESDAY, NO ACTIVITY PERIOD. Something about a Drugs Panel. . . anyway, there it is.

2010-04-05 at 00:49:23: Lotr is on at the Ritzy Dq. There is no way in which this is not the Bible.

2010-04-04 at 22:11:05: @xofconformity These were my exact jealous thoughts, only I was a little more jealous because he went camping with my BFF. Still,all good :P

2010-04-04 at 20:29:10: Happy Easter! Feliz Paschua! Felix Pascha!

2010-04-04 at 06:46:20: @damnfan I'm glad you've enjoyed it :) You made the beginning of break pretty cool.

2010-04-04 at 06:27:36: @dylanisnotamyth I've been looking forward to school since last Friday.

2010-04-03 at 17:01:16: SHOWER TIME

2010-04-03 at 15:05:44: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-04-03 at 14:50:59: @LT_TheBibleGeek It's hard to stay subdued when you know what's happening tonight :)

2010-04-03 at 06:43:28: @mariorules25 Trufax; I need you in my life right now. RIGHT NOW!

2010-04-03 at 06:43:07: RT @dylanisnotamyth: I'm soooo worthless at helping. I wish i could.

2010-04-03 at 06:29:31: @dylanisnotamyth @mariorules25 I wasn't looking forward to break at all. I want it to be over.

2010-04-03 at 04:27:31: Coolest name for an apostrophe: The comma in the sky.

2010-04-03 at 04:21:54: @dylanisnotamyth Lent ended yesterday, in case you didn't know. #randomthoughts

2010-04-03 at 03:49:20: @lalarnia AND JUST DO IT

2010-04-03 at 02:18:06: @theshyretirer Well then that's when we'll get you. We're gonna have to take you home around 18:45. . .

2010-04-02 at 23:07:42: @theshyretirer Well okay: What's the earliest you'd be willing to go? I'll work backwards from there.

2010-04-02 at 22:54:50: @theshyretirer What time should we grab you tomorrow?

2010-04-02 at 06:02:00: @disyana @damnfan @mariorules25 Enjoy yourselves :)

2010-04-02 at 05:47:26: @damnfan Very nice. Hope the walk home doesn't suck too bad.

2010-04-02 at 05:42:52: Weird, cool day. Triduum is easier in KC -- it's like going on retreat then.

2010-04-01 at 08:28:28: @mariorules25 I'm beginning to think it's just part of existing. You know that no one really *gets* you.

2010-04-01 at 07:58:35: Can't. sleep. Ugh.

2010-04-01 at 05:57:46: @damnfan We're all annoying. I like you anyway, though :)

2010-03-31 at 17:58:11: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-03-31 at 16:31:25: @jmentalcase Congrats!

2010-03-31 at 08:30:13: Things are unusually quiet at the normally bustling time of 3:30am.

2010-03-31 at 06:54:26: Well, I'm not planning on going to bed now.

2010-03-31 at 04:52:12: Bed time. Approximately.

2010-03-31 at 04:43:13: @jmentalcase Looking at your stuff is weird cause I'm always looking for a deep meaning, but sometimes I feel like I'm interpreting "Walrus"

2010-03-31 at 04:42:18: @jmentalcase I think the picture of the lady looks very nice. Also, I lol'd at the Camera-man.

2010-03-31 at 04:41:27: @lemontartsunite My music theory = shit.

2010-03-31 at 04:02:36: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-03-31 at 01:13:20: "How many days have I lost?" Well, today was pretty worthless, apart from Mass and the movie "Proof."

2010-03-30 at 03:46:09: @dylanlouisisnotamyth I lied to you: being at your house was totally in the plan. I wanted to surprise you; I wanted to see ya. Thanks :)

2010-03-30 at 01:33:03: @MaxWaters I lied. I just happened to somehow magically play that with the album version perfectly in synch, and they're the same speed.

2010-03-30 at 01:28:24: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ztFbhM5caw My favorite bass line to play right now. The album version is about half a BPS faster.

2010-03-30 at 00:45:13: @dylanlouisisnotamyth I showed up in your yard!

2010-03-30 at 00:06:59: @dylanlouisisnotamyth I traveled about 22.3 miles by bike today.

2010-03-29 at 23:57:30: @dylanlouisisnotamyth I got home a-okay.

2010-03-29 at 22:15:31: @dylanlouisisnotamyth I'd probably kill Jessi. Just because.

2010-03-29 at 22:13:03: Being DL's parents = impossible task.

2010-03-29 at 21:16:48: Just biked/walked from my house to @dylanlouisisnotamyth's. Let me in?

2010-03-29 at 21:10:37: Hanley and St. Anthony is in sight.

2010-03-29 at 20:54:58: Getting close to Hanley and 270

2010-03-29 at 20:12:57: Made a wrong turn down Hanley.... Been heading South, not North.

2010-03-29 at 00:33:03: @mariorules25 @tristasjoy Aw God, they're all qwinks!

2010-03-29 at 00:12:11: @tristasjoy For Lent. Which is funny 'cause he's definitely not a practicing Catholic.

2010-03-29 at 00:03:54: @tristasjoy My dad might be the coolest person in existence.

2010-03-29 at 00:00:20: @tristasjoy My dad's shares a birthday with Albert Einstein and Al Capone.

2010-03-29 at 00:00:03: @disanya One of the best states of being.

2010-03-28 at 17:52:18: You've got to be dead to be bigger than life, but everyone's afraid to fly; everyone wants to be on a postage stamp, nobody wants to die.

2010-03-28 at 17:48:04: @damnfan All hail the mighty Primate of Music!

2010-03-28 at 17:45:54: @damnfan @disanya :P

2010-03-28 at 17:45:29: @mariorules25 Alright, you had a really good point yesterday about us and our opinions on music. We are pretty obnoxious.

2010-03-28 at 17:38:15: @FalkionFace LOL

2010-03-28 at 17:26:50: @lemontartsunite I think you'd rock strapless.

2010-03-28 at 07:56:33: @disanya RT @disanya: @maxwaters I want olives now.

2010-03-28 at 07:45:53: @disanya Olives? Where did that come from?

2010-03-28 at 07:27:32: @disanya I'm glad! I try :) When my friends are smiling, I'm a little happier. It's a selfish selfless act of kindness, making y'all smile.

2010-03-28 at 07:20:35: @disanya Jk :P

2010-03-28 at 07:20:26: @disanya Slut

2010-03-28 at 03:31:57: @dylanisnotamyth Try reading some of the books about him.

2010-03-28 at 01:26:21: Fell asleep like 4 hours after he woke up and slept until now :/

2010-03-27 at 21:34:25: I want to wake up tomorrow and have it be Thursday so that this whole long week could be behind me :/

2010-03-25 at 03:40:48: @connivingcanard If only you knew how to spell Appalachian :P

2010-03-25 at 03:35:04: @connivingcanard Hey! :)

2010-03-25 at 03:12:42: Deus meus, Deus meus, quare dereliquisti me?

2010-03-25 at 02:50:42: Hates the burden. . . Ignorance is bliss, but mine is conquerable.

2010-03-24 at 22:18:36: I'm so lonely and bored :/ Reading about God makes me want to be with other people &gt;_&gt;

2010-03-24 at 22:11:05: @damnfan I wish I was more like the Weekenders sometimes.

2010-03-24 at 18:47:17: @xofconformity I wish we could all help each other and ourselves. I also wish we didn't have to.

2010-03-24 at 03:34:21: "Today, I realized that the word WOW looks like a golf ball stuck in grass. MLIA "

2010-03-22 at 04:18:35: @tristasjoy And I'm sure they have their own perception of colors in some fashion. Just like deaf people can understand sound vocabulary.

2010-03-21 at 17:37:06: Pok√©mon, gotta catch 'em all.

2010-03-21 at 17:28:47: @disanya Says the one who probably has her shoes.

2010-03-21 at 17:21:14: Who has Mrs. Nguyen's shoes?

2010-03-21 at 06:22:35: @spenSLUH222 do you even know how appropriate that is?

2010-03-21 at 06:18:46: I support @dylanlouisisnotamyth and @mariorules25. Go team! Stick it to her!

2010-03-19 at 02:52:09: Is done with Webassign. Now to the rest of it.

2010-03-19 at 02:30:02: @disanya False. The master of meditation -- or prayer, or any mental discipline -- can do it anywhere. It can at least be helpful.

2010-03-19 at 02:25:36: At this rate, I'm going to be up for literally a bajillion hours.

2010-03-19 at 00:29:48: @spensluh222 No. I won't listen to you.

2010-03-18 at 00:12:18: @xofconformity Your mother angers me sometimes. Quite often, lately.

2010-03-18 at 00:02:43: @xofconformity @spensluh22 The woman, @disanya, got it.

2010-03-17 at 22:40:18: Needs someone to pick him up.

2010-03-17 at 03:08:23: Is gonna be up /late/. Damn.

2010-03-17 at 01:04:35: @jmentalcase Dammit I wish I'd worked on Sciuto at all before now.

2010-03-17 at 01:01:05: @disanya @tristasjoy Yeah, lol; I just @'d Tyou since you'd been talking about it. Doing too many things at once xP

2010-03-17 at 00:50:11: @dylanisnotamyth Maybe @tristasjoy would like to help make it better?

2010-03-17 at 00:13:18: @tristasjoy Hawt. You should read it at my local library. The kids would love it.

2010-03-16 at 23:56:37: @Tristasjoy LOL

2010-03-15 at 19:50:54: Bored. Lonely. Not looking forward to the rest of the day :/

2010-03-14 at 04:56:28: LAST WARNING: Our picnic is CANCELED due to inclement weather. Please don't show up in NoCo tomorrow en masse. Thank you, and sorry guys :(

2010-03-13 at 22:47:50: Picnic cancelled! :-( please check FB inboxes for more info. Sorry everyone.

2010-03-13 at 04:00:55: RT @reapteam "Mass is not [just some] obligation;it's an opportunity."

2010-03-13 at 00:36:03: Has anyone seen a black jacket that says "Godfather's" on the back?

2010-03-13 at 00:25:09: @raspberryplaty You know, you were more fun before you started getting wasted all the time.

2010-03-12 at 23:41:43: @disanya Aw, thanks :) That makes me feel better, knowing that someone thinks about me. I'll try and stop being so gloomy, then!

2010-03-12 at 23:15:13: Bored. Lonely. :(

2010-03-11 at 04:18:38: @spensluh222 Likewise! I think there's a lot I've misunderstood about you, bro. Really overlooking a lot of potential awesomeness :)

2010-03-11 at 03:56:36: Ready to play Prison Sex?

2010-03-11 at 03:49:14: @disanya Lol

2010-03-11 at 03:38:13: @reapteam As in only put food-stuffs in it, not can of soda, box of cereal, broken computer, etc.

2010-03-10 at 04:20:19: Maybe one of these days I can straighten this shit out. . . Thank God for Laetere Sunday. . . but I need Easter, stat.

2010-03-06 at 19:18:54: @spensluh222 I hate Christian Pop too! It ruins. . . well, everything it touches, basically.

2010-03-06 at 04:21:58: (cont'd) who could be Tor and I's boy.

2010-03-06 at 04:21:44: I swear to you, in my Theology book (p107) there's a picture of a guy dressed in my clothes who looks like me, walking with a child (cont'd)

2010-03-04 at 04:02:56: I hate being alone.

2010-03-03 at 05:30:21: Man, I don't like being up this late.

2010-03-03 at 02:45:38: @natsuotoast /d/!!!????

2010-03-03 at 00:29:21: @disanya :) Take heart, Elise. The rough times will pass.

2010-03-02 at 04:15:48: @mariorules25 LOL

2010-03-02 at 04:03:37: @dylanisnotamyth I wish I could be gay for you, Dylan.

2010-02-27 at 01:55:27: Perusing liturgical norms FTW

2010-02-26 at 05:06:47: Done with that. Thank God. Damn you SLUH; the administration has taken so much from me.

2010-02-26 at 05:03:01: @damnfan @tristasjoy I'm sorry, don't worry about me. I'm just overly attached and insanely emotional sometimes.

2010-02-26 at 05:00:37: I feel like I"m going to vomit.

2010-02-26 at 04:13:12: @damnfan No need for ";_;" I'm all good :D

2010-02-26 at 04:09:00: @damnfan Okay, I do beat up on myself a bit. But hubris and hypocrisy are certainly part of my character. Sometimes that's good, often bad.

2010-02-26 at 04:02:33: @lemontartsunite Bad Catholic? Nah. At least you're not a hypocritical, pretentious ass (like me). Those are the guys that piss Jesus off.

2010-02-26 at 03:39:35: @damnfan Roger that :)

2010-02-26 at 03:36:36: @falkonface Black trench coat or black leather jacket?

2010-02-26 at 02:21:30: @spensluh222 It's supposed to kind of suck xD Thanks for being conscientious for we mackarel-snappers!

2010-02-26 at 00:04:15: @falkonface Deal

2010-02-25 at 03:03:19: RT @reapteam on tonight's retreat Gretchen asked everyone, "Is prayer your steering wheel, or is it your spare tire?" #reapteam

2010-02-24 at 05:10:06: @TristasJoy FACT (IMO)

2010-02-24 at 04:50:18: @jmentalcase I really don't know who's going. Not many people can afford it/hotels/gas. I know Rachel, I think Cait. . .

2010-02-24 at 02:44:32: @spensluh222 Yeah, no one can go to ACEN this year D:

2010-02-24 at 01:13:39: @xofconformity Yes, and reapplied to some places I'd already visited during my last job-hunting stints. Mostly, though, I'm ineligible.

2010-02-23 at 23:49:29: @xofconformity DAMMIT GETTING JOBS IS IMPOSSIBLE!!!! /rage

2010-02-22 at 04:31:25: @damnfan Sorry we left so much stuff at your house ._.

2010-02-22 at 04:11:07: @maxwaters Applies to txting, also.

2010-02-22 at 04:10:37: RT @damnfan i sometimes wonder why people never start conversations with me online then i rememberthatidon'trespondandi'mnotpleasanttotalkto

2010-02-22 at 03:57:47: @disanya I do that to people sometimes, but I feel bad :/

2010-02-21 at 05:57:19: @TristasJoy Well, on behalf of faith-filled Christians everywhere, I apologize that we're treating you poorly. I wish I could help :/

2010-02-21 at 05:45:14: @TristasJoy That's a shame. Forcing faith on someone is sinful: it makes you less likely to ever /choose/ to believe. I'm sorry ;_;

2010-02-21 at 05:02:56: @TristasJoy Right, but I know that if you were in a Catholic church, your pastor literally /couldn't/ confirm you because you don't believe.

2010-02-21 at 04:47:30: @TristasJoy And that's silly; I saw Lutherans marching in albs at the last gay pride parade!

2010-02-21 at 04:47:05: @TristasJoy Damn, I was hoping I could give you some advice, but I don't know enough about Lutheranism.

2010-02-21 at 04:41:36: @TristasJoy That really sucks, and I completely agree: it should be your choice :( Is this a Catholic church?

2010-02-21 at 04:31:52: @TristasJoy Or is it that you don't want to be forced to go?

2010-02-21 at 04:31:33: @TristasJoy Is it the church or the being with family that sucks more?

2010-02-20 at 03:57:21: @lemontartsunite FALSEHOOD!!!!!!!!!!!! (I typed each exclamation pt. individually, fyi.)

2010-02-20 at 01:18:42: I cried because I miss being a concert bassist.... But I'm not that connected to my sis either.

2010-02-20 at 01:00:08: Cried during my sis's concert yesterday. Now we're talking music...

2010-02-15 at 06:23:46: It's not auto-tuned, so thus I don't care.

2010-02-15 at 06:12:49: @tristajoy Not yet. I'm on the line, but not "on."

2010-02-15 at 04:54:10: @Jmentalcase LOL :) There's actually a chance (like 1%) that we could get a snow day on Tuesday.

2010-02-15 at 04:49:12: @Jmentalcase Snow is gettin' a bit much. . . fun stuff!

2010-02-14 at 06:39:37: @dylanlouis still trying to decide what to give up. . . Hookers?

2010-02-14 at 05:08:35: @FalkonFace My GF does that to me sometimes.

2010-02-12 at 02:26:19: @Jmentalcase YAY!!

2010-02-11 at 05:03:35: @damnfan If you want to talk, gimme a call.

2010-02-11 at 04:03:25: @natsuotoast SPOILER ALERT: SQUALL SLEEPS W/ EVERYONE LOL JK

2010-02-11 at 04:02:13: @FalkonFace n=number of times you can give up before actually giving up. n&gt;9,000

2010-02-11 at 04:01:47: @lemontartsunite I PROMISE YOU THAT YOU EXIST.

2010-02-10 at 04:13:37: I know you care, some very much. It's just getting harder to feel with every passing day.

2010-02-10 at 01:36:01: @disanya Well that is better :)

2010-02-10 at 01:24:22: @disanya Anger. It's awesome!

2010-02-09 at 06:18:05: Bed

2010-02-09 at 05:09:50: @damnfan Gotcha :)

2010-02-09 at 05:05:08: @damnfan I meant if school is canceled.

2010-02-09 at 04:50:29: @damnfan Same, lol. Afterschool OR around 2:00pm?

2010-02-09 at 04:31:31: @damnfan Webassign party tomorrow? THIS IS HARD!

2010-02-08 at 06:33:25: wishes he weren't alone right now.

2010-02-08 at 05:49:23: @lalarnia @falkonface YOU CAN DO IT! I BELIEVE IN YOU!

2010-02-07 at 23:33:22: @spensluh222 I know that wasn't directed toward me :)

2010-02-07 at 23:33:06: @spensluh222 I'm trying :)

2010-02-06 at 04:54:03: @TristasJoy Ok, so you and your debacle over Diablor or Unreal Tournament has made you my new favorite person whom I've never met :D

2010-02-05 at 04:13:25: @disanya Parents suck. I actually love my parents, but I still can't wait to get out of this house.

2010-02-04 at 06:09:33: I don't want to be awake right now. Seriously, seriously, I do not.

2010-02-01 at 23:14:11: @disanya My Adv. Geo. class last year was taught by someone who taught us stuff /way/ ahead of what we should've been learning.

2010-02-01 at 23:12:20: @disanya Specifically those quizzes, giving the trigonometric values of special angles and stuff.

2010-02-01 at 23:09:47: @disanya That same sort of thing happened to me in Geometry last year.

2010-02-01 at 05:45:21: @FalkonFace even if*

2010-02-01 at 05:44:41: @FalkonFace Tuesday, but like I'm not gonna have much time on Monday even I get no other homework.

2010-02-01 at 05:43:06: Stupid Sciuto essay. . .

2010-02-01 at 04:51:29: @damnfan @dylanlouis All I can think of is the Bible and Shakespeare.

2010-02-01 at 04:33:44: Fuck you English. I don't want to find another quote that I find insightful. . . I just want to go to bed.

2010-01-31 at 08:34:44: @disanya You're playing PJ Sam right now? We should have a Pajama Sam party!

2010-01-31 at 03:50:10: @raspberryplaty I mis-spoke earlier. I'm not really even leaving the house til ten.

2010-01-31 at 01:22:26: @disyana Ju-day Ju-day Ju-day

2010-01-30 at 23:21:41: And it's getting darker. . .

2010-01-30 at 21:05:49: @jmentalcase That's a bitchin' drawing of the Tivoli. Makes it look like the evil castle of the main boss xD

2010-01-29 at 04:35:57: It took me forever to get writing. I've been trying since I got home, and I /just/ got something down.

2010-01-29 at 03:13:38: Attempts at writing: 0-3 ._.

2010-01-29 at 00:39:14: @damnfan Mom has made it clear that, while we couldn't afford it long-term, refugees are always welcome at our house.

2010-01-28 at 05:31:22: @dylanlouis I hate this too. We have the same stuff as you do, and I just decided I wasn't going to do all of it. It's really hard :/

2010-01-28 at 03:49:31: Obama had a lot of stuff to say. . . let's see how much of that gets done, and what happens, but... cautious optimism. #stateoftheunion

2010-01-25 at 03:25:01: @KarlDoofWebster Hahaha. I think everyone had that phase, but for most people this ended a long time ago.

2010-01-24 at 21:05:26: @TristaJoy I'm not even sure that I've ever met you, but that sucks :( I hope something radical happens and you have a good b-day anyway!

2010-01-24 at 21:04:12: @KarlDoofWebster Magistra at Loop = EPIC

2010-01-24 at 21:03:29: Back!

2010-01-19 at 20:53:18: @damnfan Maybe. I just heard that DL called to ask what time it was in America, so that seems to imply he at least /was/ not in America.

2010-01-19 at 20:50:51: @damnfan I actually think DL's in Canada, but Idk what's up with Mike.

2010-01-19 at 20:40:55: @damnfan So they're not letting me leave 'til I'm done. . . which could take awhile.

2010-01-19 at 20:40:41: @damnfan but DV decided he's not coming over, and I haven't heard anything from Mike or DL.

2010-01-19 at 20:39:45: @damnfan My only excuse to my parents for stopping my preparations (mostly laundry) for my trip tomorrow was that I was giving rides.

2010-01-19 at 16:34:03: @xofconformity Call me when you wanna head down there.

2010-01-18 at 18:39:11: @XofConformity @dylanlouis You need a ref/ride/other friend?

2010-01-18 at 05:47:12: @lemontartsunite Even though I don't know Paramore songs, I bet I could figure out the bass-lines and help you :)

2009-12-26 at 05:10:38: @jmentalcase If @xofconformity starts walking now, he should be there.

2009-12-23 at 00:30:26: @Jmentalcase That'd be cool. I'd prefer basement rooms anyway.

2009-12-22 at 21:39:44: @disanya That's weird and annoying. . . I can make myself public, let you follow me via text, then go private again.

2009-12-21 at 05:22:48: @TheShyRetirer At least you admit it. Most people don't even let me know. I don't know if they care :(

2009-12-21 at 05:09:50: Apparentally @disanya doesn't follow me. Probably because #haiderisanoob

2009-12-15 at 04:04:02: @connivingconnard Lol, I was watching an 8th-grade choir, " orchestra, and " band, and they were terrible, even for 8th graders.

2009-12-15 at 02:33:45: This is painful...

2009-12-14 at 06:44:06: @damnfan I know my opinion probably doesn't count for much, but I'd rather you not.

2009-12-14 at 00:27:22: Anyone want to join me for Wash U Mass? I understand it's short notice, sorry.

2009-12-10 at 23:31:38: Alright, almost done. Going to head home now.

2009-12-10 at 22:02:25: Paper writing is awesome :-)

2009-12-10 at 01:13:09: I'm listening to Coach talk. What about you?

2009-12-09 at 23:02:00: And now, wait.

2009-12-09 at 04:19:16: @connivingcanard Just remember that an aid is not the same as a solution.

2009-12-09 at 04:01:16: @RaspberryPlaty I certainly have those days when I realize I haven't really been awake :/

2009-12-08 at 22:32:07: At school, chilling. Hungry :-(

2009-12-08 at 04:57:02: Too hyped up from panic attack earlier. Can't sleep :\

2009-12-08 at 04:42:15: @RaspberryPlaty That is probably the worst feeling in the world, forreal.

2009-12-08 at 02:45:22: And have been since about 4:00pm, when we realized that. . . Seamus was at SLUH!

2009-12-08 at 02:44:59: @alostbeauty I'm pretty damn sure I am.

2009-12-08 at 01:23:59: @carolimerose I think the showering and drinking part sounds like at least an okay time :)

2009-12-07 at 22:35:52: @raspberryplaty Can I make you impressed instead? I'll play you sweet music.

2009-12-07 at 22:31:39: @alostbeauty isn't Seamus from DeSmet such a loser?

2009-12-07 at 01:12:19: @KarlDoofWebster In order to have the draft done a week early, it needs to have already been done; it's due this Friday.

2009-12-07 at 00:57:20: @TheShyRetirer You should, then :) Sleep well, I hope you wake up refreshed.

2009-12-07 at 00:45:27: @xofconformity I agree. @alostbeauty Would probably hate Steve.

2009-12-06 at 22:05:19: @xofconformity You actually don't need a comma there.

2009-12-06 at 21:31:27: @xofconformity I thought there wasn't a difference?

2009-12-06 at 05:57:04: @alostbeauty Beauty is when what one sees, one loves.

2009-12-06 at 05:51:36: @alostbeauty But what if it was a wonderful day because @heyitscait murdered 20 beautiful people?

2009-12-06 at 05:36:49: @alostbeauty What is beauty, sir?

2009-12-06 at 05:28:35: @alostbeauty I didn't mean Chrome, I meant  Kateikyoushi Hitman Reborn!

2009-12-06 at 05:23:49: @alostbeauty And I know that @jmentalcase doesn't /appear/ to follow ~shuui

2009-12-06 at 05:23:27: @alostbeauty Well, I know you read Chrome and follow/are ~shuui on DA.

2009-12-06 at 05:22:44: @jmentalcase "Internet is real life!"

2009-12-06 at 04:49:02: I want @alostbeauty to be someone we don't know. So badly.

2009-12-06 at 03:58:28: OMG! I'm following Marilyn Monroe: @alostbeauty The most under-rated beauty of the last century!

2009-12-06 at 03:57:28: @alostbeauty and I mean that nicely, lol. Sorry :(

2009-12-06 at 03:56:43: @alostbeauty Who the Hell are you?

2009-12-05 at 21:01:56: @jmentalcase Hey, right on!

2009-12-05 at 16:45:51: time to bathe, get dressed, then hw.

2009-12-05 at 01:35:36: @xofconformity HOLY SHIT!!!!

2009-12-05 at 01:15:47: wishes that my closest friends ever wanted to hang out with me. I can't blame them for being busy, I guess. . . I know I'm busy, too.

2009-12-04 at 23:35:55: When I text people to talk, only my sister answers. :-(

2009-12-04 at 21:39:27: @dylanlouis Hey where you at dog?

2009-12-04 at 03:36:17: @damnfan BAM

2009-12-04 at 03:36:04: Who wants to come to my house tomorrow? I'd like some company.

2009-12-04 at 03:34:29: @damnfan @xofconformity LOL

2009-12-04 at 01:59:23: @connivingcanard Voss also proposes the difference in economy bases might have gotten severe enough.

2009-12-04 at 01:51:13: @xofconformity Well I know it wasn't /just/ slavery, but do *you* think there was any one issue that comes close, 'cause I don't, but idk.

2009-12-04 at 01:44:51: Hey @xofconformity , I have a question, since you wrote a paper about it: Do you think slaver was the chief cause of the Civil War?

2009-12-03 at 04:41:11: My dad knows me so well; it's awesome.

2009-12-03 at 04:39:45: The most impoverished class of all: Those who have founded their own fetters, albeit of gold and silver.

2009-12-03 at 04:34:56: "Most of the luxuries, and many of the so called comforts of life, are not only dispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of man

2009-12-03 at 04:29:23: "So thoroughly and sincerely are we compelled to live, reverencing our life, and denying the possibility of change."

2009-12-03 at 04:26:46: "could a greater miracle take place than for us to look through each other's eyes for an instant?"

2009-12-03 at 03:59:46: @xofconformity If that were true, my life would be much less enjoyable :(

2009-12-02 at 04:22:32: "Keep us safe, Lord, while we are awake, and guard us as we sleep, so that we can keep watch with Christ and rest in peace." G'night!

2009-12-02 at 04:21:49: @damnfan I think it's depressingly ironic that she cares this much.

2009-12-02 at 04:19:16: @xofconformity @disanya I'm not so big on the self-destruction (though I'm not as confident as I seem), but I am a huge hypocrite x3

2009-12-02 at 03:56:41: Good day. The SLU Pius XII Library is AWESOME, OMG :D

2009-12-02 at 03:46:59: @disanya Plus exercise helps too. :D I'm glad /you/ know how that not eating will make you fat.

2009-12-02 at 03:46:18: @disanya Eating a sizable breakfast and 3-4 mid-sized meals, tapering off toward the end of the day, maximizes your metabolism: burn cals :)

2009-12-02 at 03:35:55: before you go to bed tonight, make sure you say a prayer (or meditate, or offer an oblation, whatever) for those with AIDS. #worldaidsday

2009-12-01 at 06:00:16: Well this is late. And it'll probably be another long-haul day tomorrow. And Wed.

2009-11-30 at 03:06:45: @jmentalcase It might be cool to try, while keeping to the spirit of randomness, using it to force our eyes toward details -- unless you do.

2009-11-30 at 03:06:03: @Jmentalcase Well, it certainly means that no matter where my eyes drift I'm going to be looking I'll be entertained.

2009-11-30 at 02:56:28: @jmentalcase I really like the birds. I think the way you speckle your backgrounds is pretty awesome too. Adds a layer of nuance.

2009-11-30 at 01:37:05: @damnfan Naw, just more massive. It'd be cooler if they were still the same size but had that much mass.

2009-11-30 at 01:28:31: @damnfan Is awesome.

2009-11-29 at 23:44:24: really wish I could find Carter's Playboy interview.

2009-11-29 at 23:39:34: letting my mind drift a bit. . . I need to work more, though.

2009-11-29 at 21:09:16: There was a protest outside the Basillica, because of Carlson giving money to ME. *YAY* for the protest. *CRAP* for being a Catholic here.

2009-11-29 at 21:07:49: @jmentalcase "This Is It" is about /you/, isn't it? Seriously though, that's really awesome.

2009-11-27 at 17:53:52: @theshyretirer Ok, I give up, hahahaha.

2009-11-27 at 17:48:39: @theshyretirer Jane Austin?!

2009-11-27 at 17:46:02: @theshyretirer It's ok, everyone goes through a phase where they really like Agatha Christie.

2009-11-27 at 15:44:00: @theshyretirer It'd be cool to come see you today, but I have to go to Illinois at noon.

2009-11-27 at 15:43:15: I'd love to

2009-11-27 at 15:31:44: Anxiety's getting worse... We're gonna have to bust after this.

2009-11-27 at 15:19:43: @theshyretirer Oh yeah...

2009-11-27 at 15:15:18: @theshyretirer cause it's nine on a Saturday. That,s where I *should* be.

2009-11-27 at 15:10:23: @theshyretirer In bed.

2009-11-27 at 15:04:28: Was enjoying the flash mob, but now I'm beginning to cascade into a panic attack.

2009-11-27 at 13:19:11: Wake up, DAMNIT

2009-11-27 at 12:52:57: @jmentalcase come outside.

2009-11-27 at 12:24:53: @dylanlouis wait, should I not come get you, DL?

2009-11-27 at 12:22:59: Out the door!

2009-11-27 at 12:21:08: Damn this is early in the morning.

2009-11-27 at 06:54:39: @dylanlouis direct message me if you're up.

2009-11-27 at 06:08:10: @jmentalcase make them all polo

2009-11-27 at 05:06:52: @heyitsCait did you fix your 360?

2009-11-27 at 00:28:15: Just had an awesome #thanksgiving dinner at Holy Trinity.

2009-11-26 at 20:48:16: Happy thanksgiving, guys!

2009-11-26 at 20:48:04: @XofCOnformity I love Ham, hahaha.

2009-11-26 at 05:59:20: Je vous en prie.

2009-11-26 at 02:14:54: Tori's on tokyopop, and we saw the digimon manga - awwww yeah, get digi-jacked.

2009-11-25 at 22:13:18: back! Had an awesome time!

2009-11-23 at 04:37:31: One day of school, then retreat. I'll be prayin' for y'all; will y'all please pray for me?

2009-11-23 at 04:03:04: @dylanlouis Seriously though, I love you very much, and I am blessed to have such an energetic bro; you always make my day brighter: be :D

2009-11-23 at 03:55:45: @dylanlouis I love you man. I don't deserve you either. COnsider it a mutual gift -- like sex! (awww yeah)

2009-11-23 at 03:55:19: @dylan and you're helping me with my grammar a lot, too *

2009-11-23 at 03:55:07: @dylanlouis and your helping me with my grammar alot, two.

2009-11-23 at 02:38:27: @disanya @xofconformity Basses are awesome things to have. (Especially classical ones D: )

2009-11-22 at 23:38:26: Today's been a really lazy day - and I've still found a way to keep myself too busy to enjoy it.

2009-11-22 at 18:30:51: @ConnivingCanard *prayers* I hope you recover quickly and fully.

2009-11-21 at 21:01:03: Tori is making creepy Sims...

2009-11-21 at 20:39:17: Tori's playing the Sims as I look on.

2009-11-21 at 05:38:20: I'm seriously considering cutting my hair.

2009-11-21 at 05:27:59: fell asleep around like 7, so now I'm gonna be up for awhile :(

2009-11-21 at 00:52:59: Screw it. As of right now, I'm not even going.This is ridiculous. We chose a place;why are NoCo denizens always the ones who have to travel?

2009-11-20 at 22:19:34: Watching Mulan

2009-11-20 at 04:51:04: @damnfan You trolling + Steve = :D D:

All the efforts, sweat, and broken hearts, the screaming and the tears" Change

2009-11-15 at 15:04:49: it's about time for Mass. Grandparents are comin' in this afternoon.

2009-11-14 at 20:08:39: @HeyItsCait I spent about a half-minute trying to figure out what a "beer hug" was, hahaha.

2009-11-14 at 06:32:06: @disanya Lady Liquor, I'd imagine.

2009-11-13 at 21:42:25: @natsuotoast Waiting for your boyfriend to finish work grant...

2009-11-13 at 05:10:47: is really hoping for some life this weekend.

2009-11-13 at 04:40:55: is having a good time. Up way too late :(

2009-11-12 at 04:00:47: @damnfan you could have just divided by 4, then 9.

2009-11-12 at 03:55:53: @damnfan I'll give you a hint: You only have to do one operation, and it's a simple number.

2009-11-12 at 03:53:23: I'm saying that your answer is totally wrong, hahaha. The correct answer is somewhere around 1,000 (10e3)

2009-11-12 at 03:48:11: @damnfan You mean, like, 15e10? Yeah; it's around 1,000.

2009-11-12 at 03:33:30: @damnfan Really? Oh, well wait: I at least knew that "electromagnetic friction" is slowing us down. Why else?

2009-11-12 at 03:17:09: @damnfan Scratch that, I'm done :D

2009-11-12 at 03:13:15: @damnfan I love you, Simon. On a side note, I only have #8 left to do on Webassign.

2009-11-12 at 00:41:47: @damnfan Ha, I actually follow her and read several tweets of hers yesterday. . . *is an idiot*

2009-11-12 at 00:37:06: @damnfan It says that page doesn't exist. . .

2009-11-12 at 00:35:12: @xofconformity What's her twitter-name?

2009-11-12 at 00:22:30: @xofconformity I thought you said she /got/ a Tumblr, so I was doubly surprised to find out that Cait now had Tumblr and Twitter!! But no :(

2009-11-11 at 23:51:35: @spensluh222 I'll be your secretary if you want :)

2009-11-11 at 04:03:29: @natsuotoast That is my most common "listen to to go to sleep" music &lt;3

2009-11-11 at 01:37:26: "Don't give me a rabies?" "I said don't give me your rabies" ". . . A-rabian nights, like A-rabian days. . ." -- I &lt;3 Tori and Me.

2009-11-11 at 00:24:15: likes/dislikes having responsibilities. . .

2009-11-09 at 03:17:12: @xofconformity I'm listening to Shake Your Tail Feather from the Bad Boys II soundtrack. How about you? How about you? HOW ABOUT YOU?

2009-11-09 at 03:11:36: is listening to EI -- Nelly. Y'all?

2009-11-09 at 00:46:35: About to go on a walk, if anyone's interested.

2009-11-08 at 17:39:10: @xofconformity WIN

2009-11-08 at 06:57:48: Dear best friend: I wish I knew who you are, or if you even really exist. Did you die? Were you ever born? Do you miss me? Love - Max

2009-11-07 at 19:19:54: @natsuotoast go for it

2009-11-07 at 16:17:45: About to give my talk. Pray for me and/or wish me luck, please :-)

2009-11-07 at 04:32:22: Ended up having a good day. And day one is always the worst; the rest will be awesome.

2009-11-07 at 00:41:18: Is in a really bad mood for no particular reason and it's not a good way to be for a retreat.

2009-11-06 at 02:44:59: @xofconformity Yeah.

2009-11-06 at 02:35:49: @Damnfan Well, that doesn't matter, but I'm wearing XC stuff anyway.

2009-11-06 at 02:31:29: @xofconformity Awesome. You get the tweet about your phone?

2009-11-06 at 02:28:52: @lemontartsunite I'd rather lift you up.

2009-11-06 at 02:28:09: Is it a dress-down day today?

2009-11-06 at 00:27:20: @xofconformity Mr. Kesterson found your phone. It was in the announcements, he just didn't remember that it was your phone.

2009-11-05 at 04:21:04: @xofconformity Now you'll know what your mom feels like when I come to visit.

2009-11-05 at 04:14:48: @disanya "lololol" looks like three cannons getting ready to shoot.

2009-11-05 at 04:12:39: @damnfan @xofconformity BAM

2009-11-04 at 23:16:07: Anyone ever been up to St. Vincent Park in Normandy?

2009-11-02 at 05:23:59: G'night!

2009-11-02 at 04:59:02: @damnfan Not the ideal, but whatever works :)

2009-11-02 at 04:56:26: @dylanlouis Tell your aunt that she owes me 27cents in royalties.

2009-11-02 at 04:53:16: @disanya @dylanlouis Absolutely! I can also use those to write, masturbate, turn keys, shift gears. . . they are muy importante!

2009-11-02 at 04:47:24: @dylanlouis I'd keep my right thumb, right index, and right middle finger, so that I could still dip.

2009-11-02 at 04:30:54: has his week's agenda ready.

2009-11-01 at 03:46:13: Tori is so ridiculous, hahaha. We'll be back soon.

2009-10-26 at 02:29:29: @TheShyRetirer It's all good.

2009-10-26 at 02:24:10: @TheShyRetirer See, that tweet is unfair because I want to ask, but that tweet is implicitly exhorting me not to.

2009-10-26 at 00:39:07: @xofconformity If I gave you something to give to Ham, would you?

2009-10-25 at 21:23:48: Is about to head to the teen center.

2009-10-24 at 21:30:33: @Jmentalcase You'll be alright, I hope :D

2009-10-24 at 17:50:51: was reading through an old Latin missal, only to discover that the English translation is horribly wrong.

2009-10-24 at 01:18:01: Mom is mad at me because we haven't gotten the glasses that got broken replaced yet.

2009-10-23 at 22:03:34: @natsuotoast Whoa Ham! That is inappropriate! Don't rape @Dylan!

2009-10-23 at 21:53:26: Hot chocolate is awesome!

2009-10-23 at 20:55:32: No longer has glasses; the other leg broke off too.

2009-10-14 at 23:51:06: Homework... When my girlfriend's over... And she wonders why I feel like such a jerk sometimes.

2009-10-14 at 21:40:10: @dylanlouis would it help you if I told you I was naked somewhere in your house?

2009-10-14 at 20:44:33: Hmm... I should probably see my girlfriend soon.

2009-10-14 at 20:39:36: @xofconformity It's because he's Asian.

2009-10-14 at 20:02:19: Is broing out at Dylan's with Simon.

2009-10-14 at 01:10:19: Had a great race today. Now, relax, a little homework.

2009-10-14 at 01:09:43: @dylanlouis YOU ARE MY HERO

2009-10-13 at 03:57:09: Listening to "Foreclosure of a Dream" and doing Webassign.

2009-10-13 at 02:27:54: Had a good time at Gregorian Chant! Homework time :(

2009-10-12 at 04:05:43: @ZachWeiner You made it a private video :(

2009-10-12 at 04:00:19: //The ultimate humbling is realizing that no matter how much I love you, you'll have to die someday.

2009-10-11 at 22:55:20: Long week; long weekend. Looks like a long week coming up... I can do this, right?

2009-10-11 at 11:26:26: @XofConformity I could ask you the same thing! When I called, the only person there besides Simon was Seamus, so we decided to stay.

2009-10-10 at 19:59:57: Simon's later :D

2009-10-10 at 19:57:13: @Peaches1x I'd hate to have to mow a whole farm. . .

2009-10-10 at 19:56:26: @lemontartsunite Like

2009-10-10 at 06:07:24: @TheShyRetirer I wouldn't expect anything less XP

2009-10-10 at 06:03:39: @TheShyRetirer Why do you ask?

2009-10-10 at 05:52:57: Awesome night! Gonna be bored tomorrow, though. Hope I see some of ya.

2009-10-10 at 05:50:55: @theshyretirer It'd be cool if she weren't an 8th grader. . . but that's just a bit creepy.

2009-10-09 at 02:25:51: I have ridiculously awesome friends.

2009-10-08 at 19:22:55: Didn't have much homework, and now I got out early for an orthodontist appointment! Then no practice, so life is complete!

2009-10-08 at 11:29:57: Today's gonna be a good day, I can feel it.

2009-10-08 at 04:39:58: is about to sleep :3

2009-10-08 at 04:01:03: Make lunch, shave, shower, bed-time.

2009-10-08 at 03:32:39: @XofConformity "Just Another Day" by Oingo Boingo

2009-10-08 at 03:03:02: is really dirty and tired and wants to go to bed, but still has lots o' homework.

2009-10-06 at 11:45:59: Lovely weather this morning! Waiting for Rachel to pick me up.

2009-10-05 at 03:40:49: Had a good, if long, day.

2009-10-05 at 03:40:11: @lemontartsunite It's a full moon tonight. At least according to my astronomy-crazy Tori.

2009-10-04 at 14:31:44: Off to Mass, then PSAT-prep.

2009-10-04 at 05:25:30: @TheShyRetirer Me too. As for me, I'm headin' for bed.

2009-10-04 at 05:14:56: @dylanlouis Glad you're having a good evening, lol :P

2009-10-04 at 01:24:55: Just reorganized his phone address book. I'm cool.

2009-10-03 at 23:43:29: Is being surrounded by horny couples, but Tori and I are chill... Fun...

2009-10-03 at 23:39:07: @Damnfan He'd better go with Cait. It'd make @meavictoria happy.

2009-10-03 at 23:36:40: @Damnfan Who'd Mike go with?

2009-10-03 at 23:11:16: Ritenour kids have drama too, but they get it solved in twenty minutes, lol.

2009-10-03 at 22:19:36: At another Ritenour pow-wow. Have fun at your homecomings, everyone :-)

2009-10-03 at 17:40:32: So yesterday, Tori chugged a can of Monster and crushed it in between her boobs. I have found a soulmate, haven't I?

2009-10-03 at 02:06:23: @DV But I'll answer everytime :P

2009-10-03 at 02:06:06: @XofConformity Haven't even gotten through "Dogs" yet, lol.

2009-10-03 at 01:51:46: I, Dylan, am listening to the album _Animals_, by Pink Floyd.

2009-10-03 at 00:28:27: Is gonna be stuck all by himself tonight doing homework. . .

2009-10-03 at 00:28:15: 19:55, placed in the high thirties out of over two-hundred :D

2009-10-02 at 18:18:00: is gonna get ready, eat, then go. I just realized this course is a lot like Sioux; I'd better do well today, then.

2009-10-02 at 15:35:51: isn't at school -- very yes! Race in 7 hours.

2009-10-02 at 02:48:13: realized today that a several of the weaknesses he sees in others are really just projections of his own. . .

2009-10-01 at 02:50:28: @Jmentalcase I mean just like a quick sketch before HR or during AP.

2009-10-01 at 02:28:18: @jmentalcase Mr. Steingruby told us to make our homework a work of art. Can I have your help?

2009-10-01 at 00:39:44: is stoked about life!

2009-09-30 at 04:36:10: G'night!

2009-09-30 at 03:55:02: @MeaVictoria well I've sent you a fair amount, and I've gotten none back.

2009-09-30 at 03:52:00: @MeaVictoria are you getting my texts?

2009-09-30 at 03:34:37: @carolimerose The religious marriage, and esp. the Catholic sacrament of matrimony, looks a lot different, but has those underlying themes.

2009-09-30 at 03:34:03: @carolimerose It's not just religious. It's a promise to always *stay with* and love a person. Not necessarily monogamous, but binding.

2009-09-30 at 01:55:28: Is already done with Webassign!

2009-09-30 at 01:54:59: It's not a surprise. I told him I'd have one made, lol.

2009-09-30 at 01:45:23: @MeaVictoria I see :D

2009-09-30 at 01:28:03: @spensluh222 Well, she loves his old hair, pretty much.

2009-09-30 at 01:27:43: @MeaVictoria Austin Winn? As in, the guy whose pillow you'll be making once you recover? How'd you see him?

2009-09-29 at 03:24:46: G'night (?) !

2009-09-29 at 02:44:13: @ConnivingCanard I sit up in the Martyr's Chapel at one of the desks on the outside.

2009-09-29 at 01:31:19: Bout to head home.

2009-09-29 at 01:04:44: At SLUH doing homework still...

2009-09-28 at 04:58:48: really, really shouldn't have put off all his homework.

2009-09-28 at 03:40:14: got to go to Mass after all! Mom and I went, had a good time :D

2009-09-28 at 03:39:22: @ConnivingCanard Your life has some meaning. If nothing else, it made my life a little cooler.

2009-09-28 at 00:46:53: Dad's car broke down, and they need to borrow mine to fix it, so now I have no means by which to get to Mass.

2009-09-27 at 23:27:24: is doing homework and wishing Tori wasn't sick and being whiny and down and --  I NEED MASS.

2009-09-27 at 23:26:59: @carolime Awesome use of "whom!" I'm proud of you, English major!

2009-09-27 at 15:56:52: is gonna go running soon.

2009-09-27 at 15:50:55: @XofConformity I think your source just misheard. I mean, why would anyone have a desire to make that lie?

2009-09-27 at 15:38:47: Hm. . . I think someone either misheard a story, or is trying to spread rumors, which is ridiculous. @xofconformity

2009-09-27 at 07:26:18: @TheShyRetirer I take my "thank-you's" in smiles, :D

2009-09-27 at 07:10:00: @TheShyRetirer Consider it a gift, then.

2009-09-27 at 07:06:28: @TheShyRetirer You're actually pretty cool, and surprisingly insightful, and can use your selfishness in the least selfish ways possible.

2009-09-27 at 06:11:06: @CarolimeRose Haha, about earlier? No, that wasn't about you :P

2009-09-27 at 06:08:06: @meavictoria That's very awesome! I love you.

2009-09-27 at 06:06:37: @dylanlouis SLEEP, LOL

2009-09-27 at 04:45:49: Had a good night, mostly. Things are going just the way I thought, pretty much. A few suprises.

2009-09-27 at 03:39:20: Oratory is definately a charism, a gift from the Holy Spirit.

2009-09-27 at 02:45:08: Someone wants attention.... Oh well, at least she's doing better.

2009-09-27 at 01:50:07: Rachel's knitting, Ham's dancing, and we're waiting for Connor to get here to watch Lost in Translation.

2009-09-27 at 01:23:06: American Beauty was actually pretty good. Most are out getting another movie, us few are watching Ham DDR.

2009-09-26 at 23:15:23: At Olivia's, bout to go on a soda run with Rachel.

2009-09-26 at 22:48:54: Driving to Olivia's staring at the rainbow.

2009-09-26 at 22:48:25: @spenSLUH222 @xofconformity Dylan got me into LOG by showing me that video, lol.

2009-09-26 at 22:08:50: So, we don't seem to have any items on the agenda. Any suggestions or complaints for the Councili?

2009-09-26 at 22:03:40: NoCo council.

2009-09-26 at 19:14:36: Even if I gave you my whole life, I couldn't give you the attention you need... But I still have to try, don't I?

2009-09-26 at 18:01:48: @heyitsCait in bed?

2009-09-26 at 17:06:27: Watching Scrubs and DL playing Mario.

2009-09-26 at 08:30:47: It's really late...

2009-09-26 at 06:42:46: @natsuotoast G'night

2009-09-26 at 06:38:04: Is talking about rail with Mike and Voss.

2009-09-26 at 05:52:22: @natsuotoast if we both got peg legs, we could be pirate metal-heads!

2009-09-26 at 05:45:32: I beat Dylan to a tweet!

2009-09-26 at 03:57:02: To Dylan's!

2009-09-26 at 02:50:50: @MeaVictoria Hopeful that what?

2009-09-26 at 02:29:07: @spensluh222 Except in bed O_o

2009-09-26 at 02:25:42: knows someone who appears to going insane, but doesn't want me to help.

2009-09-26 at 02:23:51: @spensluh222 Do you really think you could notice the almighty, ever-hidden, ever-present DL-sensei?

2009-09-26 at 01:49:39: had a good race! Waiting for DV or Mike to call me.

2009-09-24 at 03:38:17: has spent approximately 7.66 hours on homework alone today.

2009-09-24 at 02:48:29: @TheShyRetirer Very true. Just ask my aunts ;)

2009-09-24 at 02:37:54: @TheShyRetirer Lol :P Incest is icky, hahaha.

2009-09-24 at 02:24:21: @TheShyRetirer It's just wasabi. Not a big deal, seriously.

2009-09-24 at 01:24:31: @MeaVictoria AWESOME!!!!

2009-09-24 at 00:11:38: Is about to head home.

2009-09-23 at 22:48:43: At school doing homework.

2009-09-23 at 03:20:13: is gonna go to sleep, in an attempt to use said sleep to make tomorrow's free time more productive. G'night!

2009-09-22 at 03:24:00: is working on homework. Phsyics done, now Sc3.2&3.3 of Much Ado.

2009-09-22 at 02:59:13: wants to walk with you all into the darkest depths and the highest heights and all the places in between.

2009-09-22 at 02:52:11: @lemontartsunite If good, then I can help you :)

2009-09-22 at 02:51:50: @lemontartsunite You have several, though none close by. How good a grasp does your heart have?

2009-09-22 at 02:34:24: @MeaVictoria you too dear! Sweet dreams! Grandma says hi!

2009-09-22 at 02:30:52: @Jmentalcase Nice

2009-09-22 at 02:10:47: @MeaVictoria Fuck Zachary Quinto

2009-09-20 at 14:34:21: is about to go read at Mass, then PSAT prep course, followed by lots and lots of homework.

2009-09-20 at 04:58:41: @meavictoria I wish so too :(

2009-09-20 at 04:56:26: @xofconformity Why does my phone never show me your tweets? It's very annoying :(

2009-09-20 at 00:43:26: It didn't rain! Just sittin' in the garage, waiting for some action.

2009-09-19 at 22:33:28: Is at the Holy Trinity fair, praying it won't pain.

2009-09-19 at 04:00:24: had a good evening at the Festival. Race tomorrow -- not racing, but still very excited for the Jr. Bills at Sioux Passage!

2009-09-18 at 03:43:27: is getting off of the Tweet matrix for now. G'night, Twits!

2009-09-18 at 03:06:37: is gonna do the rest of his homework during AP.

2009-09-18 at 03:03:36: @MeaVictoria In bed!

2009-09-17 at 04:13:39: really doesn't like this late hour. G'night!

2009-09-17 at 02:53:23: is being taxed, yet still living -- exactly what I'd hoped Junior year would do for me.

2009-09-16 at 23:48:50: Is really tired of it, because he's done nothing to deserve it - in fact if deserves a lot better.

2009-09-16 at 01:35:57: @Damnfan VERY

2009-09-15 at 23:32:10: Bout to head home.

2009-09-15 at 03:25:25: YOU LIED. "Nothing too awful is going to come out of all this." This schism is almost too awful to bear.

2009-09-15 at 01:42:03: @meavictoria sleep is to you like food is to me.

2009-09-15 at 01:13:23: is listening to "Dogs" -- Pink Floyd.

2009-09-15 at 00:45:54: @TheShyRetirer Ah. Well. . . "Everywhere I Go" is playing in my head, but I'm about to listen to Rush.

2009-09-15 at 00:26:53: is having a weird mood right now.

2009-09-15 at 00:26:45: @TheShyRetirer As opposed to what?

2009-09-14 at 03:03:28: is goin' to bed soon. So, g'night! Question before I go: what are the different things that make your friends happy?

2009-09-14 at 02:30:21: @heyitsCait Everybody's workin' for the weekend!

2009-09-13 at 23:45:16: Is not going to the Newman Center. Oh well -- life night.

2009-09-13 at 22:19:34: Is having a good day! Hanging with Tori and Amanda, then life night, then Wash U Mass, then bed.

2009-09-13 at 17:52:52: got back from the teen donut-fest; we actually made a little money! Tor and I had a good time. 'Bout to head to Gingham's.

2009-09-13 at 14:20:21: IN BED

2009-09-13 at 03:55:30: is going to bed numb. G'night.

2009-09-13 at 02:43:13: @jmentalcase http://bit.ly/D6UrT

2009-09-13 at 01:01:15: @spensluh222 No, I'm not upset about it now. I understand, a little bit, what's going through his head. If he wants to stay home, it's ok.

2009-09-12 at 22:19:29: @spensluh222 Actually, I just discovered he's /not/. But oh well, he's talking to people.

2009-09-12 at 22:17:06: is tired. Of more than one thing, but not of it all, not one bit.

2009-09-12 at 22:16:47: @spensluh222 And guess who's going to Angela's!

2009-09-12 at 20:07:48: @natsuotoast Your hair is worth it. Keep it!

2009-09-12 at 18:55:11: SLUH swept the meet today! At Dylan's working on his computer.

2009-09-12 at 11:54:31: Grabbing gear at SLUH, then up to the XC festival!

2009-09-12 at 01:16:14: 's girlfriend hot-glued her glasses back together. &lt;3

2009-09-10 at 03:56:00: is finally goin' to bed. G'night!

2009-09-10 at 03:51:02: @carolimerose Just laugh and shake your head; you know I'm just playin'.

2009-09-10 at 03:13:49: @carolimerose That's a mistake easily fixed.

2009-09-10 at 02:54:58: @carolimerose It should at least work somewhat like FB.

2009-09-10 at 02:36:59: loves Mr. Baud.

2009-09-10 at 00:35:23: has another boatload of homework to do.

2009-09-09 at 11:27:39: Is really excited for today for no apparent reason. Good morning!

2009-09-09 at 02:50:56: Thinks @natsuotoast is awesome.

2009-09-09 at 02:44:12: @natsuotoast draw me and Tori!

2009-09-08 at 03:35:12: Has decided that he needs to start hanging out with the Rosemonts less as a group and more in small gatherings, 1-3 people.

2009-09-08 at 02:48:29: Phone is dying... ;_;

2009-09-08 at 02:25:50: TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI

2009-09-07 at 21:31:53: Working on English...

2009-09-07 at 21:22:01: @xofconformity probably after  Spencer helps you dump your HD

2009-09-07 at 21:14:17: @xofconformity In that case, something is terribly wrong. I think I should bring my screwdriver set over sometime after school.

2009-09-07 at 16:50:51: is gonna do some homework now. Had a good, but pathetic, run.

2009-09-07 at 06:14:15: G'night!

2009-09-07 at 06:09:24: has honestly fallen in love with this stupid Twitter thing. . . I'll never attempt to explain it to anyone else, but it's actually nice!!!!!

2009-09-07 at 05:03:56: has had a good day :D

2009-09-06 at 23:34:57: Just fixed Sims 2 for Tor. Then she kicked me off the comp.

2009-09-06 at 22:30:33: @natsuotoast LOL

2009-09-06 at 22:27:31: @rawryjay Yep. I had a little problem with it, 'til I realized the BIOS was just mal-configured. Also learned some Linux techniques.

2009-09-06 at 22:23:29: @rawryjay Yes! And thank you so much! My computer is like three times sexier now, and it's all thanks to you!!!! xD

2009-09-06 at 22:21:11: is fixing his computer up so that Tori can hopefully play Sims 2 (oh, and I wanna play too :P).

2009-09-06 at 21:43:11: Thinks the Twilight community has ruined his chances of reading the books.

2009-09-06 at 16:25:01: I'm gonna get this day rollin'.

2009-09-06 at 15:57:02: | Shower

2009-09-06 at 05:50:57: |G'night!

2009-09-06 at 05:25:43: had a pretty good evening!

2009-09-06 at 00:18:56: @xofconformity Twitter doesn't send me texts, but Tori says your facebook status looks sad. So have a :-) and a better evening.

2009-09-05 at 22:46:23: @everyone Debatable.

2009-09-05 at 21:50:46: Needs a big map to put on his wall.

2009-09-05 at 21:07:39: The conservative Christian grandma of Grace's just showed up... I'll just not talk to her.

In my head, Hell is less about punishment and more about honoring free will.

2023-05-26 at 22:03:03: @0bviouSquirre1 It's still universal Christian theology, if you're at all the sort of person who cares about that sort of thing: God only forgives the genuinely contrite. If monsters want to keep being the kind of people who deserve God's smiting justice, God will still smite, even post-Jesus.

2023-05-26 at 22:01:26: @0bviouSquirre1 now ofc, many people ignore this. but i think those people would prolly find other frameworks for self-justification.

2023-05-26 at 21:58:26: @0bviouSquirre1 fwiw the framework for Confession is p clear that there has to be genuine  1) recognition of what you did, 2) of why what you did was wrong, 3) a genuine agreement that it was wrong, based in an actual understanding of the act and its context and not just mindlessly assenting.

2023-05-26 at 21:54:00: @Hooberland_ @towheretobegin @RichDecibels Which I totally think can be used as an excuse to say, "Oh see, they still do ultimately have a choice though!" and ignore systemic realities, 100% agree w that. Still, it feels weird to put a cap on theoretical agency-- it's hard to know how 'free' someone is from the outside

2023-05-26 at 21:52:08: @Hooberland_ @towheretobegin @RichDecibels I vibe w most of what you're getting at, but this seems a bit off-- well, I guess I'm just wondering at what point differences in contexts make comparisons less useful. But more importantly, I do think there's a degree/framework within which one can have agency in *any* situation

2023-05-26 at 20:26:31: @forthrighter That's an incredible metaphor, and an evocative one -- I'll check it out!

2023-05-26 at 19:32:44: @scalinglaws @RichDecibels @towheretobegin Yeah, but I will concede that how much it impacts your agency is v path-dependent, and choosing one's path is itself correlated with agency. I want to live in a dense-ish area in a house-sized space, and I want kids. But those are choices, I do absolutely have agency there.

2023-05-26 at 17:25:48: @RichDecibels @towheretobegin Define 'very low wealth' plz? Not that I think poverty's an absolute limit on my agency (and there are many workarounds for lack of funds) but my life definitely gets *markedly* easier when we're making at least $20k/yr/household-member.

2023-05-25 at 03:14:36: Like there are a few things that I haven't published because it's about something really important to me and I know it could be a lot better still. But like. . . I can just publish the draft and come back to it later. It doesn't need to be a perfect manifesto the first time.

2023-05-25 at 03:06:58: If I were trying to maximize audience size it might make sense to worry about hypersaturation, but I'm not. If I want to fixate on some idea or mechanic or emotional texture or something, I'm allowed to do that publicly, I don't have to restrain myself so as not to 'overwhelm.'

2023-05-25 at 03:06:57: For example, I have 4-5 different things that take place in Genesis and I feel like I have to pick one and the others are just background work for the published one, but like. . . Why? That's hierarchical af, Mary, that's not anarchy at all xD

2023-05-25 at 03:06:56: It just hit me that one reason I don't publish as much as I could is because there's some part of me that feels like once I've published something I've 'used' the idea/conceit/setting/etc.

&amp; there's a lot of guilt wrapped up in it for me. The pain is painful /and/ I often see it as a symbol of all the ways I mistreated my body (mostly at jobs/school). 

Huh. I haven't forgiven myself for that mistreatment. That's prolly important.

2023-05-24 at 17:25:38: @calnthoughts But purposeful avoidance seems like 85% of it for me. There's a lot of pain and unpleasant sensations in my body. Some problems that are either currently intractable or just take a while to fix but are in-progress. I'm in p much constant pain in my shoulders/neck. Escaping that.

2023-05-24 at 17:23:26: @calnthoughts Tasty spaghetti! So ye, not as much social context for discussing embodiment, and we think about what we talk about. And there's definitely an 'ease of movement' component -- I often imagine a feeling of floating in mid-air, embodied but not weighed down.

2023-05-24 at 17:10:36: @calnthoughts And it's confusing bc bodies are so fascinating so why can it be hard to get as interested in it as I get in things I can't even see and play around with and poke at??

In the original creed that word (those words) weren't there, but they were added in the time of Charlemagne. It's a fun Trinitarian rabbithole; Spirit doesn't get explored enough

2023-05-17 at 20:50:36: 1 Kg 19 is patterned on Ex 33 is patterned on Gen 18 and Gen 32, which are all related in various ways to Gen 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8.

I'm sure there's still more for me to notice/have pointed out to me -- like I said, I haven't even looked at 1 Kg 19 itself yet

It's all like this üôè

2023-05-17 at 20:50:35: Palm of her foot is a kind of interesting phrase, right? It also shows up as "Palm of the loins," ie the hip socket. Of Jacob, in Gn 32:25 having an encounter with God or an angel or?

I've left so much out. And it's just so dense and interconnected.

2023-05-17 at 20:50:35: In fact, there's a word in Gen 18, where Abraham offers God a place to rest and wash their *feet*, that also gets used in the flood narrative -- it's about the Dove (seen by Christians as the Holy Spirit) looking for a place of dry land to rest 'the palm/sole of her *foot*'

2023-05-17 at 20:50:35: And of course, scattered through /all/ of these there are allusions to the Creation story, to the planting of the Garden, fleeing from God, taking the forbidden fruit, Cain murdering Abel, the flood, and the covenant with Noah.

2023-05-17 at 20:50:34: I haven't even gotten to it yet, actually? Because that story is very much patterned on the story from Exodus 33, where Moses encounters God. But then it turned out that of course that story is /also/ patterned on/with Gen 18, where Abraham has an encounter with God or angels or?

2023-05-17 at 20:50:34: So I wanted to write about 1 Kings 19, when Elijah encounters God, since I saw something about it earlier and my attention is easily hijacked -- well actually I've just wanted to collect some juicy Bible stories? This ended up being /very/ juicy. Uh. . .

My gut, educated guesses, etc

2023-05-15 at 18:41:50: @forthrighter But I should caveat this all by saying that I'm just some side-line enthusiast, I'm not even an IT professional of any kind, let alone LLM's. I'm basing this primarily on my own reflection on the conversations I see/participate in on the GPT4all discord and on twitter.

2023-05-15 at 18:40:25: @forthrighter ... even if there aren't any further major breakthroughs in the field, ever -- which doesn't seem likely, but is definitely not impossible. I think they're just gonna end up being p cheap (money and compute-wise) for how useful they are, and that'll make all the difference.

2023-05-15 at 18:38:49: @forthrighter That's a fair response! I'd agree there's a p good chance that by the time LLM's come close to living up to their hype, society will have moved on, so maybe it's won't be v visible.

2023-05-11 at 02:34:39: @KanekoTheKoolio This guy is so damn good with the references ü•≤

2023-05-10 at 21:31:54: Allowing for copies just adds a wrinkle to selfhood, it doesn't collapse it. The idea that it can diverge or split into copies, or even be picked up and spun up eons later

Oh she actually goes into that a bit.

And then dies. . .

The end ig!

2023-05-10 at 21:31:54: She does at least start exploring the idea that the brain is material, by imagining someone making a physical duplicate of a brain.

They also keep assuming that there can't be multiple of the same self -- like, on the level of 'if more than one copy is made, neither are OG!Self'

2023-05-10 at 21:31:53: Yeah and then Cohen immediately doubles down on this bifurcation. What a wreck!

Weirob throws out an interesting idea, implying that identity is a person's relationship to a self-concept, often memory-chains.

2023-05-10 at 21:31:53: So even if Julia's brain-memories were preserved, all of the bodily context would be missing; and likewise, it would have all of these new body-memories with no brain-context. These two unrelated patterns might be able to stabilize into a third person, but it seems unlikely to me

2023-05-10 at 21:31:52: I highly doubt that kind of brain transplant is really possible at all. The nerves aren't just, like, separate cords, like a phone-line plugging into the router-that-is-you. The division is for simplicity, but it's fake.

2023-05-10 at 21:31:52: Weirob says no, but then makes the unfounded claim that it would be Mary, 'because it's her body.' But it's not like the brain isn't part of the body! Imo, *either* this is a ship of Theseus problem, *or* the resultant person is a new, entirely 3rd person.

2023-05-10 at 21:31:51: The biggest annoying assumption is that they keep treating the body and the brain as completely separate. A scenario is presented wherein the brain of Julia is put into the body of Mary. Is this new person Julia? Cohen and Miller say yes, obviously -- Julia's brain.

2023-05-10 at 21:31:51: Like bruh, have you never heard of Christianity? We're admittedly a lot better at showing 1 = 3 than 1 = 2, but just ask Jesus how many persons He is, it's a whole fuckin' rabbit-hole xD

2023-05-10 at 21:31:50: All parties involved keep making points/moves that ultimately seem pretty spurious. I guess this is perhaps my own bias about what kinds of objections one has to seriously contend with.

And really bold assumptions, like: "One cannot be identical with two."

2023-05-10 at 21:31:50: Further down, after Cohen joins, Weirob summarizes his argument about memory thus: "A person is a certain sort of causal process." She adds, the "causal chain from remembered event to memory of [said event] never leads us outside the confines of a single body.

2023-05-10 at 21:31:49: Like he clearly thinks about the human person as one solid 4D structure, but he'll only briefly put it forward that way before hurrying into arguments about /memory/ specifically, which. . . is just gonna lead to more complications.

2023-05-10 at 21:31:49: Miller actually has a lot of more interesting ideas that he doesn't flesh out very well b/c he's being overly conventional -- which is to say, Perry is having him stick at a lower level of the conversation for the audience's sake, I think.

2023-05-10 at 21:31:48: I imagine they're gonna get caught up on which connections are the identifying ones, and/or who gets to decide that. Let's watch. . .

Yeah immediately. Obviously. And I bet this is where my 18 y/o brain started lighting up xD

2023-05-10 at 21:31:48: He talks about how the nature of the connection can actually be quite fluid and malleable -- how the second game could start with all the same players, or the first game could continue with new players substituted in, for example.

2023-05-10 at 21:31:47: Early in the 2nd night, Miller starts talking about how really any claim of identity is a claim of connection between parts -- he uses the example of someone who leaves for a long time toward the end of game one of a doubleheader and then asks, 'Is this still the same game?'

2023-05-10 at 21:31:47: Okay, this kinda shit is why I wanted to dig through the archives: Just found notes on John Perry's /A Dialogue On Personal Identity And Immortality,/ and I had *completely* forgotten about it, but I'm re-reading it now and it clearly had a *huge* impact on me.

2023-05-10 at 19:57:52: @embryosophy Beautiful; that video actually brought tears to my eyes. Having it pointed out what 'articulated' has meant this whole time is also ü§Ø

2023-05-10 at 18:45:43: Yeah I've always been like this lol.

Already plenty curious, but then the monsignor at my parish loaned me a copy of N.T. Wright's "Surprised by Hope" when I was like 12 or 13? And I've been hooked ever since.

2023-05-10 at 18:45:43: It's not the /most/ sophisticated analysis but I was 16! I didn't have to go that hard lol. They're definitely useful enough to be added to my notes, which I did *not* expect from any of the highschool stuff

2023-05-10 at 18:45:42: Ooohh! I just found this thing I did as a sophomore in highschool: I summarized each chapter of the Bospel of Matthew into 1-2 short paragraphs, listed off all the Tanakh references I could find in each chapter, and other interprative notes.

2023-05-10 at 18:36:59: @tasshinfogleman One of my fav parts of Twitter tbh, much obliged!

2023-05-10 at 18:25:34: There was another idea in there, more implicit:

Relationships as sets of affordances.

I need to let it percolate more, but I think those definitions would blend well together. Helps w the fact that, in some circumstances, meaningful interaction is *itself* a non-trivial request

2023-05-10 at 18:25:34: Ahhhh, yes, this is more like it:

Relationships ongoing exchange of requests in a broader context of meaningful interactions.

2023-05-09 at 17:44:58: Not without getting into close enough relationship to them that an awareness of their 8oSing would just naturally arise anyway. 

But damn it sucks to clearly see a pattern and not be able to point to it clearly enough to be helpful.

Everyone has a mix of intractables and 8-of-Swords, and you can /guess/ from the outside but you can't /know/

2023-05-09 at 17:44:57: It's hard to get someone to admit that there are any 8-of-Swords in their life when others are trying to gaslight them into thinking that all of their problems are 8-of-Swords problems. They either buy it, and  often throw themselves at intractable problems that are actually. . .

2023-05-09 at 17:44:56: And ofc the hard part is that p much /everyone/ has a mix of both problems that are genuinely hard and then more 8-of-Swords situations making things unnecessarily hard on themselves.

2023-05-09 at 17:44:56: But I still find far more annoying any (temporarily) high-agency person who have so little compassion and sympathy for those stuck in negative feedback loops, and/or who assume anyone with any intractable problems must be doing to themselves. And/or conflate these two things.

2023-05-09 at 17:44:55: There is no sharp clear line where victim mentality ends and an accurate assessments of the limitations in your life begins.

2023-05-07 at 05:19:11: That said, there's still a lot to tag and/or edit once I'm done with raw import. And there's still a *lot* left in my local files

2023-05-07 at 05:19:11: There are a few documents that I'll keep using primarily in G-Docs, mostly the translation stuff. The formatting (esp wrt RTL text and highlighting) is just not as robust in Obsidian. But it still feels like my stuff is way more consolidated and organized than ever before.

2023-05-07 at 05:19:10: Hit an important milestone in the Obsidian migration today: half a million words! (530146 rn) In just 429 notes.

That also marks the completion of the migration of my Google Drive.

2023-05-07 at 01:45:38: Not bc I like seeing others struggle w stuff! But bc I feel less 'behind' or w/e, the object of struggle ceases to have as tight a grip on my self-valuation -- 'Oh, if person who I respect struggles with this thing too, maybe I don't have to hedge my respect for myself?'

2023-05-07 at 01:45:38: It'd be nice if I were less reflexively comparing myself to others, yes, sure.

Still: One of my fav things on twitter is watching someone I respect (in part/whole) because I thought they had a solid grasp on something, and then seeing they struggle w that thing too.

2023-05-05 at 20:47:24: @UntilTrees I wish I knew more specifics, but I just know that basically the show was all Anno's at the end of the day, but that he had some serious mental health nosesdive as the last few episodes were coming due, but no one else could really capture his 'je ne sais quoi', so. . .

2023-05-05 at 20:40:35: @UntilTrees Yeah it's. . . a lot! Challenging in places. But I liked 'em both xD And yeah the series' ending was definitely undercooked. Do you know the production story behind that, Hideaki Anno's mental health and all that?

The common critique is that what's really happening is that a person at point A is disintegrated and a copy is made at point B, but that's never felt like a reading that's actually faithful to the way we see the transporters work.

2023-05-05 at 01:14:42: So I've been curious: when people say they're gonna upload their brains and live forever, what does that really mean?

2023-04-29 at 18:45:10: PART 2 HERE:

https://t.co/M86qA4evm2

2023-04-29 at 18:45:09: Luther had really hoped Erasmus would take a more solid position and stand with him, but E. demurred, saying he didn't want to threaten the independence of his scholarship. Luther took this poorly, and blasted him for being a coward or a vacillator.

[There's still more, pt 2:] https://t.co/7ofFnUxV5E

2023-04-29 at 18:45:08: He and Luther ended up writing letters with each other, ofc. He actually had a lot of respect for Luther and agreed with many of the reforms Luther was calling for. Luther, for his part, really respected Erasmus as a scholar, freely admitting he felt outclassed in that regard.

2023-04-29 at 18:45:08: Perhaps in part *because* the book wasn't in the hands of anyone who couldn't read Latin or Greek, [that's wild speculation on my part, as is a lot of this tbh,] it was actually pretty well received, and he was somewhat surprised to find that it didn't hurt him v much to publish.

2023-04-29 at 18:45:08: There were certainly stories that the Pope got his hands on a copy of the work, which certainly said a lot of things that could put the Pope in a bad light, though never outright decrying the Pope himself. Reportedly, he thought it was pretty funny.

2023-04-29 at 18:45:07: Publishing in Latin meant (for better or worse) that he reached a smaller, but higher status, audience. But the book contained criticisms of both the Church and of the Protestants, a satire delivered as a speech from the *literal* personification of moronic stupidity, Stultitia

2023-04-29 at 18:45:07: And so he just doubled down on what he believed: he published a book called 'Morias Enomion / Id Est: / Stultitiae Laus / Desiderii Erasmi Roterodami Delamatio'
that is,

'PRAISE OF FOLLY [Grk], 
that is, Praise of Folly [Ltn], 
a declamation of the desire of Erasmus Roterodamus'

2023-04-29 at 18:45:06: Then the Protestant Reformation started. Erasmus hated those vibes, because (and again I'm resonating v hard w this) he often found himself overly constrained and caught between two warring factions. But he was a scholar of too much note to not get drawn in to the debate.

2023-04-29 at 18:45:06: I had no idea the Textus Receptus was his, that blew my mind. It was the basis of a lot of the scholarship that followed, and remains (though edited by later generations) one of the more important primary sources for Biblical scholarship today.

2023-04-29 at 18:45:05: Tyndale's translation was a *huge* influence on the King James Version, and thus, on p much every single translation of the Bible into English, through lineage.

The 6th edition of his Greek NT text became known as the 'Textus Receptus' -- *the* 'Received Text.' https://t.co/Hfsn66tnPB

2023-04-29 at 18:45:04: Later, when Luther published his German translation of the NT, it was Erasmus's Latin text that was provided on the other side, rather than the institutional gold standard of Jerome's vulgate. Tyndale may have also used Erasmus's Latin to produce his English translation. https://t.co/vdo3X8tw27

2023-04-29 at 18:45:04: A couple times in his career, a rush to publish actually led to a bunch of errors and the need for him to rush even more, editing and correcting and sending it to J Froben to rush out a new edition as fast as he could.

2023-04-29 at 18:45:03: He actually produced the first ever manuscript of the New Testament with Greek on one page, Latin on the facing page. At the time he'd had to compile his own critical Greek edition, as there were no whole manuscripts available. https://t.co/Cml7nKeeLx

2023-04-29 at 18:45:03: His flight took him to Basel, Switzerland, where he felt he had much more freedom. He thrived here: he met publisher Johann Froben and his son Hieronymus, who'd go on to be co-author of over 200 works w him, he was generally well-liked, and  'notables' *traveled* to see him.

2023-04-29 at 18:45:02: His next gig was the U of Leuven, which did expose him to Hebrew -- he'd call for the establishment of a college teaching Latin, Greek, and Hebrew --  and some friends, but also exposed him to a lot of bitter cynical pushback; he soon left Leuven, fleeing 'mental persecution.'

2023-04-29 at 18:45:01: He had a stop in Venice, getting one of his books re-printed by a well-known printer, and being the companion of a fellow humanist, philosopher Giulio Camillo.

2023-04-29 at 18:45:01: He'd long wanted to go to Italy, so when the sons of the King of Italy's personal physician happened by, he leaned on his prior exp of giving rich men some 'company' on a trip, sailing home w them; and that was his ticket to the University of Turin, where he earned his DDiv.

2023-04-29 at 18:45:01: A lot of people in England had opportunities they wanted him to pursue -- even the King wanted something out of him -- but he and John Colet chilled out, making Greek textbooks and getting a (what we'd call a) prep school up, running, and staffed.

2023-04-29 at 18:45:00: "Erasmus preferred to live the life of an independent scholar and made a  conscious effort to avoid any actions or formal ties that might inhibit  his individual freedom."

TOO RELATABLE üò¨

2023-04-29 at 18:45:00: He'd picked up Greek after a visit to Oxford:

"Despite a chronic shortage of money, he succeeded in learning Greek by  an intensive, day-and-night study of three years, continuously begging  in letters that his friends send him books and money for teachers"

Relatable af

2023-04-29 at 18:44:59: he passed it up to fuck around at Queen's Collage with John Fisher, because of the growing humanist scene there, and spent 5 years lecturing Greek, but it ended up being a mediocre time where he didn't have adequate medicine for his gallstones (at the time: wine).

2023-04-29 at 18:44:59: Idk who was whose boytoy, but the two of them went on a tour through England meeting all the other cool kids, incl Thomas More and John Fisher, the chancellor of Queen's College. 

Another friend, John Colet, turned him to theology; offered a lifetime professorship at Cambridge;

2023-04-29 at 18:44:58: he was *released from his monastic vows*, a considerable privilege at the time, and basically became a lay priest (you can't un-ordain somebody).

He then got picked up by a 'attractive, well-connected, and rich young' man who happened to be a British baron -- he wanted 'company'

2023-04-29 at 18:44:58: [I'm basicallly summarizing wiki tbh]

sent away to be a bishop's secretary after being discovered in an affair with one of his fellow monks, which he would spend the rest of his life trying to distance himself from (eg by really doubling down on the sanctity of hetero marriage);

2023-04-29 at 18:44:57: üßµ
Yoooo, how have I not read up more on Erasmus? I knew he was a father of humanism but WOW.
Parts of his story are so resonate for me, jeez.

He was the bastard son of a priest and his housekeeper, who died of plague when he was young; poverty forced him into the Augustinians; https://t.co/3odnPA4aJ2

2023-04-29 at 18:44:38: Erasmus had a devotion to Terminus (the Roman border-god) as something of a personal symbol. He had a ring that he thought was of Terminus, but was actually Dionysus. It also had a dick (a Herm) on it.

AND. . . that's it! I learned a lot, lmao. Erasmus, wow. Added to my list.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:37: "In my opinion it is wiser to treat men and things as though we held this world the common fatherland of all." Letter to a friend.

He had a fairly disctinctive signature outfit, a modified Augustinian habit lined with fur for warmth, and a hat upholstered on the back.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:37: His last words were, according to his friend Beautus Rhenanus, "Lieve God," that is, "Dear God."

He was so prolific that he basically decided the canon of great Church Fathers just by getting his translations out there. Three famous commentaries all cite him, incl John Calvin's.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:36: This has generally been taken not so much as a sign that he rejected it as a Sacrament, but that he did ultimately feel that God could provide the grace directly Himself. 

Erasmus was buried in Basel Minster, the formerly Catholic Cathedral, a Protestant stronghold.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:36: His strength began to fail, and Queen Mary of Hungary invited him to move to Brabent. But he died suddenly during a return visit to Basel.

Despite his loyalty to the Church, he did not receive last rites. It isn't known if he asked for a priest or not.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:35: His last work, which he was unable to edit before he died, was a massive, sprawling manual for preachers. Though suffering from the unfinished sprawl, it was still regarded as a fairly fitting culmination to Erasmus's career.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:35: He *may* have published a fake translation of non-existent manuscript of St. Cyprian's? Hard to say.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:35: "He believes that the things which are the least ostentatious can be the  most significant, and that the Church constitutes all Christian people " -- not just the clergy, who are in fact the servants, not the Church itself.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:34: When Erasmus did more directly outline what he'd like to see in Church reform, he still did it in an odd way. He focused on Sileni, figures associated with Bacchus, revelers. But it's largely about not judging by external appearances: he later names Christ as the chief Silenus.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:34: He wrote a book, 'Institution of Matrimony,' arguing that wives were *not* subservient to their husbands, but equal partners.

OMG he even wrote a treatise about his distaste for overly-Ciceronian, hyper-classicized Latin, I am falling in love with this man lmao.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:33: Erasmus often reflected on and wrote about the philosophy of Language and the nature of linguistics, including a book on the subject. But he never developed a fully cohesive, systematized framework.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:33: He deeply believed in the power of Scripture to convert the soul toward Love.

But he lived in deeply divided times, and toward the end of his life he found himself caught in controversies toward 'opponents' he was quite sympathetic toward.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:32: The Enchiridion was a fairly earnest work, not at all like his frequently satirical tone. He called on clergy to empty out the treasury of knowledge and distribute them to the people. He called for personal, meaningful spiritual disciplines, and love of Scripture and Patristics.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:32: He published the 'Enchiridion of the Christian Soldier', a book written as advice for a lay knight at the request of his wife. He decries formalism, that is, going through the motions of tradition w/o actually knowing what they're about or why they're done. https://t.co/7zGhGeRTYf

2023-04-29 at 18:44:31: Probably in no small part as a response to Machiavelli's 'The Prince,' published three years prior, Erasmus published a book 'On The Education of the Christian Prince,' which took p much the opposite tack. (What a magnificent subtweet lol.)

2023-04-29 at 18:44:30: "By the 1530s, the writings of Erasmus accounted for 10 to 20 percent of all book sales in Europe." ü§Ø

Wrote a proverb collection, 'Adages.' 

He's generally credited with coining the phrase 'Pandora's Box,' but it was actually a mistranslation on his part, was actually a jar! https://t.co/P6y1KFhPe0

2023-04-29 at 18:44:30: Again, Erasmus was a fan of keeping the vibes at a certain level of quality, "because in this way the truth, which is often lost amidst too much wrangling may be more surely perceived." He often argued in favor of milder punishments for 'heretics' during the Counter-Reformation

2023-04-29 at 18:44:29: But as far as a course of action on truly resolving the conflict? Erasmus continued to not call for anything in particular, and this maddened the Protestants in particular.

The frenzy continued to deepen, and when Basel adopted the Reformation, Erasmus decided to leave.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:29: There were a few times when he really rolled up his sleeves and took a firm stance on something. One of them was the nature of free will. Erasmus had a rather expansive view of it.

Though he did his best to steelman Luther's argument, he ultimately rejected it utterly.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:28: [That's 'Blessed Mary, Virgin'.]

On the Church's part, however, he was often viewed by critics as Luther's enabler: "Erasmus had laid the egg, and Luther had hatched it."

Erasmus reportedly shot back, upon hearing that quip, "Luther had hatched a different bird entirely." https://t.co/sK7oURsQF2

2023-04-29 at 18:44:28: He ultimately tried to thread the needle and stay neutral, hoping to influence each side to bridge back toward the other.

He supported lay access to the Bible in translations, but also affirmed the Apocrypha as [deutero]canonical, all 7 Sacraments, and BMV's perpetual virginity. https://t.co/lQ4W9CBuex

2023-04-29 at 18:44:27: He also accused Luther of really moving the goalposts by de facto turning himself into the sole arbiter of what Holy Scripture 'really' means.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:27: As far as the doctrinal arguments themselves, while Erasmus was v sympathetic to a lot of their causes, he ultimately felt they were too quickly throwing out tradition in favor of the teachings of the loudest, most well-known upstarts in this new era of Protest.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:26: He saw how angry people were after their sermons, how much of their time was spent puffing themselves up and orienting their lives around hating others, and it wasn't a vibe he wanted to fuck with. (Good God the relatability!)

2023-04-29 at 18:44:26: ERASMUS PT2 

Erasmus, for his part, just really didn't like the Evangelical vibe. (relatable yet again.) He saw too many people associated with the Protestants as being brutish hypocrites, no better than the corrupt Church they were claiming to replace.

2023-04-29 at 16:28:11: When you (me) spent your (my) whole life defaulting to emotional enmeshment, interacting open-heartedly with others without taking on responsibility for their emotions can feel kinda sociopathic (to me).

2023-04-29 at 15:01:22: "No Man is wise at all Times, or is without his blind Side." --Erasmus, Moriae Enconium

2023-04-29 at 14:43:19: @calnthoughts Opening area continues to be a great bloodvial farming spot thru the whole game so I have *so* many memories of that boulder lol

2023-04-29 at 14:40:53: And as far as AI writing encroaching on human writing, I continue to be unconcerned. AI writing is only good when well-prompted and well-trained, and at that point it's a human-AI collab, and I dig those. But at this pt, AI by itself can't make art, at best it can mimic it.

2023-04-29 at 14:40:52: I'm more or less: 'AI sure is gonna happen, some of it's gonna be great, some of it's gonna be horrible, it sure could kill us. Just like any number of things'

I believe AI should be p much unregulated, free as possible, widely distributed. Hoarded/monopolized AI cld be disaster

2023-04-29 at 14:40:52: Speaking of overcorrective penduluming how have we as a society found ourselves with so little middle ground between 'AI is the worst, most dangerous thing' and 'We are literally building the Messiah'?

(This is a rhetorical question, the answer is almost self-evident)

2023-03-27 at 18:42:04: We both know the risk is substantially lower, and neither of us are worried about being in indoor crowds on a moment-to-moment basis as we go about our days, but like. We still mask. And it adds a little weight onto every decision of 'Do I want to go do [x].'

2023-03-27 at 18:42:03: At this point in the pandemic I'm finding it really hard to assess what makes sense in terms of risk-mitigation. Pelle's long covid really changes that calculus; on my own, I would probably not be very concerned at all at this point. But I'm horrified of getting her sick.

2023-03-21 at 17:41:35: There's a messed up therapist -patient relationship, and interestingly, the more they've chosen to just 'own' that, the easier it's been to see that they've processed around it, and actually doesn't feel as romanticized.  So pussyfooting has the *opposite* of the intended effect.

2023-03-21 at 17:41:35: I'm reading a fic rn that's got a fun premise, decent writing (mostly), but story keeps talking about stuff author clearly feels a lot of shame around, and I found myself wishing they would just /own/ it, even the stuff that squicks me out.

That is a VERY important lesson.

2023-03-16 at 20:16:10: @chjrwis @visakanv Yeah totally! None of those explicitly condemn curiosity, but all those stories show that it's very human for curiosity to tempt us to disobedience and mistrust of God. We are absolutely meant to see curiosity as a central and very dangerous factor in these stories, 100% agree.

2023-03-16 at 03:24:25: @visakanv Depends on what you mean by curiosity, I think? One could def say the Bible has a surface-level negative view of curiosity, but even that's undernuanced: Books of Wisdom and Proverbs, clearly encourage reflection and intellectual pursuit as holy ways to honor God.

2023-03-02 at 13:58:25: So I'd start with the reimaginings that are solidly orthodox, then move out to stuff that's not institutional but I feel confident about, to less certain possibilities and avenues for exploration with less guardrails.

2023-02-20 at 17:09:36: I should definitely clarify that the authors and editors of Bereishit Rabbah would almost certainly hate that take. Androgyne-Adam was (afaict) about metaphysics, not socially-constructed gender.

2023-02-20 at 17:09:36: People like to quote Gen 1:27 against trans people: "Male and female He created them." 

But acc to the rabbis in Bereishit Rabbah, what's meant is that Adam was made an androgyne, later split into two. So in Gen, singular they for NBs have been baked in since the beginning!

(Unless, occasionally, maybe a third person comes by to flirt with second person, and we *also* have chemistry together.)

2023-02-18 at 17:48:29: @RichDecibels But that only works for people with certain attachment styles, certain lifestyles, etc etc. And being poly does present you more often with opportunities to instrumentalize a fellow-human, and require more awareness of one's needs and limits. But mono has its costs too ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

I definitely feel squikked out by ppl who treat their connections as disposable and flit their attention, but to me that is only indirectly related to exclusivity. I value one-on-one intimacy but I don't need so much that I feel like it's a zero-sum game.

2023-02-03 at 10:52:00: Oh: If I want to give things to the poor for free, I have to demand that the wealthy pay exorbitant amounts. *I* have to personally embody this, I can't just hope that this will start happening. I have to be willing to figure out how that works and test things out myself.

2023-02-03 at 09:56:25: Every tradition has this I imagine, but the writings of the saints really should come with a "Warning: Some of the stuff this guy says about the world and/or God is really about the shape of his particular damage. Human discretion is advised." 

(True for everyone tho so. . .)

2023-02-03 at 09:56:25: So much of that is obviously cope over starting off as an outgroup and then becoming a persecuted group. 
"I'm not too poor to eat everyday, I'm embodying the idea that I shouldn't have as much as I want. . . because. . . I'm imitating the martyrs! Yeah, that's the one."

2023-02-03 at 09:56:24: Good: the Christian tradition has a firm conviction in God's plan for human embodiment and the necessity for maintaining a relationship w the body.

Bad: The presented 'ideal' relationship of a person with their body is almost always adversarial and abusive.

2023-01-30 at 17:02:18: @UntilTrees [That* said.] Most sins, you'd just repent, pray and get forgiveness -- there was some understanding that attendance at Mass grants a kind of absolution, but was not always strictly needed. Genuine contrition is the only hard-fast requirement for God's forgiveness in that trdt'n

2023-01-30 at 16:59:07: @UntilTrees They said, confession as practiced, w the private booths and all, is a relatively newer development. (Irish in origin actually.) Originally the sacrament was about public penance for major sins that affected whole communities.

2023-01-30 at 16:56:35: @UntilTrees They end up w technical meanings that I honestly don't have at the top of my head. But it is understood in RCC moral theology that if you have the genuine intention to go to Confession, that your sins are forgiven by God at the moment of contrition -- unless you de-repent.

2023-01-30 at 16:54:24: @UntilTrees Modern confession, priest says "I absolve you of your sins," and talks of God's mercy and forgiveness. Old-school, included a few prayers for God's forgiveness, then for Jesus's absolution, then adds the priest's. Absolution vs forgiveness is... Fuzzy. Mostly synonyms and yet...

2023-01-30 at 15:34:32: @UntilTrees I could probably speak more on this if you want, not that I think it matters a whole lot. But if you're talking confession and you're curious, rabbit hole isn't too big on this one.

2023-01-26 at 06:46:05: Hilariously, Tobit 12:6 (one of the non-Hebrew, Deuterocanonical Apocrypha Second-Temple period book written in Greek) is quoted 3 times, translated into Latin a different way each time, and none of the three versions is correct.

2023-01-26 at 06:46:05: Tr-dentine L-tin Mass, from vesting &amp; asperges all the way through to the optional prayers after. Tenakh quoted in Hebrew; LXX, New Testament, and Orthodox Liturgy quoted in Greek; everything else in Latin. Follows the tradition of using the texts proper to Trinity Sunday.

2023-01-26 at 06:46:04: So I remember thinking to myself about 10 years ago how it'd be nice to have a copy of the text of the Mass that actually took everything back to its source languages. I was a little surprised I couldn't just google a copy.

2023-01-21 at 02:01:28: @KanekoTheKoolio Obviously that scene was a mess, and I do think they got a lot of things wrong in ways that harmed everyone involved. . . But in retrospect I'm noticing I have more kinship (heh) with that scene than I really feel comfortable admitting.

Yeah I wrestle with this for various reasons, including embarrassment, and guilt over how I treated a friend when they went through a big kinning phase. But I'm really just ground-softening tbh, maybe steelman-ing.

2023-01-21 at 01:43:27: @forthrighter Indeed! The story of evolution from polytheism to polytheism-but-Lord-first to monolatry to strict monotheism in the scriptures is way messier than those institutions have projected! It's there, but it's not 100% clear-cut -- purposeful metascripture on Lord's part, perhaps?

2023-01-21 at 01:29:47: 'Even if he's wrong, he's wrong for reasons I want to pay attention to anyway.'

2023-01-20 at 19:37:12: I just can't make myself believe that Lord is the only god / godlike spiritual entity out there. I can admit to viewing Lord as inherently above them - - especially for his worshipers - - but them just not existing at all? I don't buy it!

2023-01-20 at 19:37:12: The conflation of worshiping idols with worshiping other gods is an interesting one. You can easily worship an idol of Lord -- worshiping the form of worship itself for instance -- and if other gods are real, you absolutely could distinguish them from their images.

2023-01-20 at 18:57:25: 'That‚Äôs what I mean by misplaced false humility, one which is actually very prideful. Real humility would involve remembering that the people around me see my humanity in ways I *can't*, and trusting in that.'

2023-01-20 at 15:02:48: I'm struggling to articulate the heart of this. The idea of a transaction actually runs counter to the sustained or open-ended nature of relationship, even a relationship between people who only meet once! It implies a narrowing, implicitly closes off spontaneous exchange.

2023-01-20 at 15:02:47: I had a problem with the exchange being elided, having both given and taken far more in a relationship than the other party. I thought people just didn't like the word. But no: it implies a kind of temporal modularity and atomization, not an ongoing relationship.

2023-01-20 at 15:02:46: So, turns out that there's actually a huge difference between "relationships are transactional and anyone saying otherwise is trying to get something from me" and

 "healthy relationships involve mutual exchange, be mindful of what that is."

Jesus only took one reason for martyrdom, plenty of other contexts left in which to die for one's ideals

Porn is hyperstimulus. It will change your brain.

2023-01-19 at 18:08:02: Bright lines of absolutist abstinence basically only serve to eye-catchingly mark out, "Fun fire to play with here -- now w/ added rebellious context!" And they often elide truer dangers.

Few things require absolute abstention. But *everything* requires some care and awareness.

2023-01-19 at 18:08:01: I still consume porn (infrequently), even though at times, in places, that has caused damage. But actually, the most damaging porn I've consumed was written, not video! And Kurt Vonnegut prolly did more damage to me than that, even! *All* required a more protective context 1st.

2023-01-19 at 18:08:01: Fun thing about this take is that it's never exactly wrong, but it is invariably presented with a puritan's fear and absolutism.

2023-01-16 at 16:58:44: (If you haven't gathered by now, I will choose option three and prayer.

Thank God I finally realized I'm no role model.)

I want my witness to prompt people to be thoughtful for themselves about what they do and don't want. Don't learn the hard way. Let these characters do that.

2023-01-16 at 16:58:44: Think this all means I have ~3 options (to oversimplify): 1) undercut my own work at every turn so as to not risk leading anyone astray, 2) never publish, 3) accept that, even if I wrote an impassioned preface about this stuff, some readers will use it to build the Torment Nexus.

2023-01-16 at 16:58:43: Is that really probably much healthier? Probably not! Would that stop me from doing it? Probably not! That's kind of the whole point of what I'm writing about! It's deliciously human, to charge right into what we know is bad for us; so I'll just *write* about playing with fire.

2023-01-16 at 16:58:43: But that's not even what I'm after. I'm after that vicarious enjoyment. And after the reflection: to understand myself better, to understand human nature better. But mostly, I'm trying to 'lose weight,' so I'm going to write about all 'the cake' I want instead of 'eating' it.

2023-01-16 at 16:58:42: And in that process, sometimes what also shakes out is away to integrate and honor what is holy in a dangerous decision, even if it's still not part of my narrow way; maybe I realize there is a way for me to get a healthier version, one I'll like even better.

2023-01-16 at 16:58:42: But mostly? I want to let chars make the tempting, unhealthy decisions, and just let them live it so none of *us* have to. What has come out so far for me, is reaffirmation of why they wouldn't be healthy decisions, alongside reaffirmations of why they're so tempting for me.

2023-01-16 at 16:58:41: I don't want to feel burdened having to model good behavior for an audience. I'm not even particularly interested in working v hard to illustrate *bad* behavior for an audience, or explaining what makes it unhealthy. (Not that I can just abdicate all responsibility to readers.)

2023-01-16 at 16:58:41: Let them deal with the consequences, positive and negative. Watch them try to double down if they can, or realize their folly if not. Or maybe they'll convince me it really isn't so black-and-white. And then see how they try and move forward (or backward) from there.

2023-01-16 at 16:58:40: Reflection from last night: 

I'm drawn to write stories where characters are tempted to pass up a healthy decision via an option I find unhealthy but romantically/idealistically appealing: I want to fully explicate each, I wanna let them make the *unhealthy* choice-- then watch.

2023-01-16 at 16:00:19: @losingcontrol23 Well hey I'm personally realizing I mistake 3 for 1 all the time. Little hungry paper thin ego taking ideas offered in good faith and eating them raw instead of respectfully rejecting them or cooking them into a true meal, smh.

2023-01-11 at 06:43:59: Wow that really is 95% of it huh: it feels less shameful to be a weed addict-- TONS of those! --than it does to be an adult in the process of learning how to properly self-regulate. But there're WAY more of those, it's just less legible/discussed! If you /must/ compare, See that!

2023-01-11 at 06:43:58: IF we let ourself look at what we're doing, and stop using legible faux-'shame' (I like smoking a lot) to hide from less legible, actually-felt shame (I rely too heavily on this and other unhealthy [at least in sufficient doses] stims for nervous-regulation). Let that reality in!

2023-01-11 at 06:43:58: So planned or not, you can handle sobriety. And if neither sobriety nor unsobriety slow your roll. . . then "The problem is in another castle." So: you've already stopped relying on weed for plenty of other things it's not suited for. Stimming's next? We can totally handle that!

2023-01-11 at 06:43:57: (Also notice how much more you can do when you're not writhing &amp; torturing yourself with the idea that you should be using an unplanned break as an opportunity to quit; that's just made me feel like I had to prioritize finding another dose before I was unable to break my resolve)

2023-01-11 at 06:43:56: But anyway Mary, this might be the biggest thing that helps your future endeavors here: Notice how you've still been able to live fully this time! You're still writing, still translating, still getting outside, still reconnecting. Unplanned sobriety has *barely* slowed your roll!

2023-01-11 at 06:43:56: (Alternatively: S/o to my dad &amp; the absolute fucking fiasco of a trip we had 4 wks ago serving as permission to feel okay looking critically at how I was reared. That's also melting problems away, letting that reality in. Funny how 'more reality' is almost always the best answer)

2023-01-11 at 06:43:56: Honestly I'm beginning to think that a lot of my 'problems' were literally just waiting for me to turn 30 -- which is infuriating and hilarious and an important lesson to keep in mind when I'm starting to get closer to 40 xD Not even rly trying, and stuckedness is MELTING in 2023

2023-01-11 at 06:43:55: Oh, caught another thing: Too many friendships were tied to weed, but now isolation has gotten tied to it instead. And I don't always feel good about needing as much time alone as I seem to need, &amp; so will lean on my addictions to give myself permission to take the time. Fixable!

2023-01-11 at 06:43:55: OH: The past-me's who've had the most/easy opportunity to stop this sooner are also some of the me's with the least emotional resiliency-- I'm scared of piling guilt on /them/! Again though: I've managed to soothe these past-me's in similar situations, and gotten better at it!

2023-01-11 at 06:43:54: But is that so scary, really? I've felt that kind of guilt and/or anger a *lot* throughout the last year or two, over the resolution of s/t that I could've ended much sooner. Has it destroyed me yet? Nah! It's honestly not even that big a deal anymore. So. . . Hm. . .

2023-01-11 at 06:43:54: And I'm not even actually bothered by the stuff I've told myself I'm bothered by! I'm using all that stuff, seemingly intractable, to avoid stuff that I clearly and obviously could change. 

Why? First answer to arise: Fear of feeling guilt/anger over not having done it sooner.

2023-01-11 at 06:43:53: Knowing that I *could* willpower through something if it mattered enough to me doesn't really make a difference if it *doesn't* matter to me. Its mattering to other ppl won't do it either-- especially if it doesn't actually even matter to them either! I'm the *only one* bothered!

2023-01-11 at 06:43:53: Breath/aerobic exercises. Breathing w a straw. Affordable, at-least-equivalently-healthy non-psychoactive smoking substitutes. Other, at-least-equivalently-healthy stims. Fully feeling feelings (via rlvnt prereqs). Other intentional self-soothing &amp; nervous regulation. &amp; al &amp;c &amp;c.

2023-01-11 at 06:43:52: But when these aren't problems,it doesn't (inherently) matter HOW much time I'm high. And what's the biggest thing in the way of solving these problems? Not weed itself, but reliance on it for stimming. I've used focusing on smoking less to distract from what'd actually allow it:

2023-01-11 at 06:43:52: And again, that's not even the goal! I love weed's company, &amp; high me. Tho I do love who I am sober, too, &amp; do wanna spend more time with her. And I want more dreams! But *mostly* I'm tired of my schedule being pushed around by "When do I get/need to go off to smoke/caffeinate?"

2023-01-11 at 06:43:52: Turns out I don't rly mind being sober, 's'not the problem. But being unsober isn't either tho! It's that my favorite stimming techniques make me high. I'm 100% confident I could quit weed cold turkey if I started smoking cigarettes or grinding teeth, but... Worse problems imo.

2023-01-11 at 06:43:51: It's hilarious how often the way to do something really hard is "Realize that what you *actually* want is easier to get some other way" and/or "Try getting out of the problem's way and letting it work itself out."

(A few of you point this out /repeatedly/. Thank you: thick head)

2023-01-11 at 06:43:51: Last time I had to go a while w/o weed I basically just shut down. This time around I am actually still managing to live life! But there is still this *constant* bg feeling of, "Great, but like when *do* I get my good-good throat-lung stim?" And uh... Idk Mary. Not today at least

2023-01-11 at 06:43:50: I've dropped a lot of shame around having addictions. But they're still annoying to manage. Now that has led &amp; will lead to some, slow progress, but it's insufficient: smoking's still too load-bearing. Breathing 'hits' thru a straw is better than nothing, but ain't rly cutting it

2023-01-11 at 06:43:50: (Oh yeah: remember that you stopped your other favorite addictive stim, VAPING NICOTINE,  2 years ago, after a /very/ rapid tapering. You really shouldn't be that surprised that your progress cutting back on weed-stim hasn't gone farther, without any third stim to replace them.)

2023-01-11 at 06:43:49: (Best as I can tell, CBD flower might actually be significantly better, and it's like half the price w little-to-no psychoactivity, so that is def s/t I'm gonna try next time we're funded. &amp; tho I'd love to vape again, even w/o nic it's prolly worse than flower, esp longterm.)

2023-01-11 at 06:43:49: I'm wondering how smoking CBD flower or vaping nicotine-free juice compares to weed wrt lung damage. I feel like if I had a substitute throat/lung stim I wouldn't even have to make much effort to smoke less, it'd just happen automatically as I conserved low-tolerance.

2023-01-10 at 20:12:47: "God loves to play peekaboo in ambiguity, and generally doesn't like to answer the questions They've equipped us to answer for ourselves." Is that a description of your Divine Father or your grandfather, Mary?

(Fun thing is not all these ideas are 100% wrong, but... Wow.)

2023-01-10 at 20:12:46: "God had a plan, but now They're just sitting, getting older, waiting for us to grow up so we can drive Their story alongside Their Incarnate Son." Hmm, what a coincidence that this gut-level hunch about God mirrors the story of my family for the last several generations.

2023-01-10 at 20:12:46: Last night I was wondering how much Eden was supposed to be the echo of a child getting booted out of their home by their parents, now I just saw three different tweets in rapid succession talking about divine-to-family parallels... What is in the water?

2023-01-10 at 05:55:12: (Want s/t else? Don't worry: I'm too curious about the rest of my stories to not get around to them too. Genesis could start /soon/ tbh, &amp; it &amp; Veil will both probably be well underway before the end of the year. *Big* Fic is... It could be done in 1 month, or many months, idky.)

2023-01-10 at 05:55:11: Mary is allowed to enjoy a little escapism and not be trying to Convey Meaning all the time-- as a treat!

(Also if you want to read some SU fics, keep an eye on this spot: https://t.co/FcWIHE3iOF What's there already is a fraction of what's written.) (That link was hard to add!)

2023-01-10 at 05:55:11: Anyway, even if all I ever write is fanfiction I'll still end up pleased w what I've written; so I wanna keep dropping resistance to 'getting distracted' by additional &amp;/or branching stories just bc they're fics. &amp; start letting myself write even fluffier stuff if I want! (I do!)

2023-01-10 at 05:55:10: So I started with a gestalt entity I figured I'd have an easier time writing about! And then honestly the thing most holding Un/Veiling back is flat characters, which is why I've been letting them cook while practicing fleshing out others' characters and my 'easier' characters.

2023-01-10 at 05:55:10: I'm actually pretty sure that I only need to write up a sizeable chunk of this side-burner project before I'm ready to start pecking at the Genesis story -- which is a misleading working title tbh: it's less about Genesis, more about a particularly complex kind of gestalt entity.

2023-01-10 at 05:55:09: And I definitely needed practice with fleshing-out characters. And there were a few challenging conceits I wanted to try easier versions of first. So now when I get to 'the Genesis story,' 'the Un/Veiling story,' &amp; al., they will be significantly better for not having gone first.

2023-01-10 at 05:55:08: In the process of using fanfic for practice, I realized that my view of [esp my own] fanfic as somehow lesser than [esp my own] 'original' 'content' is just not based in reality. Some of my fic stories are fluffier, sure. But a lot is just as 'valuable'/'serious' or w/e as my OC!

2023-01-10 at 05:55:08: I'm pretty proud of what I've published, and *much* prouder of Big Fic I'm working on. Yet tbh there's a sense in which all my SU fic-ing is practice for original stories w significantly trippier, more challenging conceits. Still, these fics are fun, and good stories themselves.

So that it may become manifest that one's works have been worked in God." Jn 3:20-21

2022-12-31 at 03:21:36: I was today years old when I learned that Jesus stumbling three times while carrying the cross during the Passion was C*th*lic tradition and not actually based in Scripture /at all/. I thought it was just John where he doesn't stumble, but nope! Simon doesn't help him in John tho

2022-12-31 at 03:11:53: @myceliummage Makes me think of Jesus during the Passion in the Gospel of John: just the way he carries himself, especially in the dialogue he has with Pilate. Standing erect, confident. Lord. Walking forward, carrying his cross wherever His Father needed it to go. Absolute King shit.

2022-12-31 at 03:07:30: 'Uncovering shit you genuinely hadn't considered before, and looking at it? That's neat. And neat makes you smile! It's worth the risk of having your mind changed.'

2022-12-31 at 00:19:30: I didn't put together that my 120th birthday was in 2112 until THIS YEAR.

2022-12-31 at 00:19:29: If Death doesn't come for me sooner, I don't intend to die until 2112, at the ripe age of 120. (If God wants to give me one extra year just to be funny I'd take it)

I'm not just numb I'm actively avertive. I legit cringe rn. That can't be the best place to come at this from.

2022-12-30 at 20:12:00: @seaofceres I hadn't considered the angle that she certainly had other routes available, that's fair. I don't even know much about the situation. I'm just... tired of my trans-ness being reduced to an opportunity for outrage. And tbh I'm tired of alienating those who aren't upset. Suboptimal

2022-12-30 at 20:00:21: @seaofceres Oh sure, right. I just meant, me and my small dick just aren't offended enough to think it's worth distracting from the on-going conversation. (This phrase and BDE both feel like kind of a metalevel parody critiquing the values which reinforce patriarchy and body negativity tbh.)

2022-12-30 at 19:52:57: @seaofceres Just exhausted of seeing trans-ness used to derail other conversations tbh. I couldn't find your other posts about this, would you mind going into it or pointing me to one? From what I remember, I feel like I'm in the targeted demo for being offended by this phrase, but. . . Eh.

2022-12-30 at 19:01:11: And I mean I've made plenty of decisions as an adult that doubled down on all the unhealthy patterns I picked up as a kid. Just. . . Trying to remember to be careful how I check in with children around how much they've eaten and how full they are.

2022-12-30 at 18:59:24: I may have more sympathy on the adults around me if I'd ever showed *any* signs of malnourishment besides my small build. I was p damn athletic, I wasn't struggling in school... They were clearly projecting stuff onto me (their own insecurities over their parenting/pedagogy?)

2022-12-30 at 18:59:24: In retrospect one of the most harmful questions I was asked as a child was "Is that all you're gonna eat?" All the adults around me thought I was 'too skinny', and so they wanted me to stuff myself overfull. So I did. Now I have disordered eating like Wow. Many other factors, but

2022-12-30 at 17:27:03: @losingcontrol23 I'm in a process of trying to get in his head better, learn about how he saw Judaism, and how he saw its connection to his own teachings. This tension really eats at me but it clearly didn't trouble him. It'll take a year or three for first fruits, but easily a lifetime's work.

2022-12-30 at 17:07:25: @losingcontrol23 I've received signals from Jewish people my whole life that belief in the teachings of Jesus are incompatible with Judaism. But yeah clearly can't just walk away from it. Been sitting with this tension the last couple years in particular. No easy answers, from my perspective.

2022-12-28 at 22:15:58: You need that -- that 'cutting through the bullshit' feeling. You need truth like you need to fill your lungs, and you've only been letting yourself take such shallow breaths. What, don't want to smell your own shit? No: ashamed to be seen not recoiling from it. Breathe *fully*.

2022-12-28 at 22:15:57: Keep on using the medium of twitter if that's what it takes. Wanting to preen isn't a crime; desiring positive feedback is about as human [/positively] as it gets. Just see yourself. See the world. Let yourself stare at the places whence you've habitually averted your gaze. Open.

2022-12-28 at 22:15:57: These aren't unique shames, Mary. Addictions to caffeine, weed, 5D chess, and righteous superiority are some of the most common things. So many of us were born into this, raised in it, told it was good. It's amazing that you're even trying to fight back; I'm proud of you. Endure.

2022-12-28 at 22:15:56: grandparents. I mean, he was the kid who got sent to seminary school starting in *kindergarten* so like... that seems like a lot already.

2022-12-28 at 22:15:56: You were raised in the middle of your family's epic, multi-generational 5D chess game. One *huge* reason your life has felt so wonky since Grandpa died is that he'd been the driving force keeping it going. I wish I could ask him how much he inherited from *his* parents and

2022-12-28 at 22:15:55: I kinda wanna shake you by the shoulders. I kinda wanna pat your head infantalizingly, genuinely endeared. You were basically raised in an environment guaranteed to help you ignore things, to segment your awareness. To lie to yourself so you could lie to others, or just get by.

2022-12-28 at 22:15:54: But anyway you've been kinda obnoxious parts of this year. Pretending to be above it while actually being really bad about it. Really bad. (I'm still doing it! Whole thread basically also doubles as extended subtweet slash quarter-apology, to a few people, one in particular. Hi?)

2022-12-28 at 22:15:54: Play the game for the Love of the game. Only play if you see participants as Beloved; there should be no 'opponents' in 5D chess. And when you do inevitably find yourself caught in somebody else's game, don't play to win, play to Love. (Also: try playing some other games!)

2022-12-28 at 22:15:53: It is understandable -- good! even -- that you learned to defend yourself from a psychic wargame that you can at any time be involuntarily conscripted into. We live in a culture that normalizes weaponized 5D chess. But you hate that, so do something about it! Put down your gun!

2022-12-28 at 22:15:53: (Easier said than done.) The only way out of 5D chess is through. Letting yourself see it. Playing the games you're caught in to completion. Admitting that you do like to play, and being intentional about it. Conceding the match to walk away, when appropriate.

2022-12-28 at 22:15:52: But you know when you're preaching for your own edification and when you're trying to play 5D chess. You know. You just know! You're getting better at admitting that you know, too, seeing it earlier. It's a popular game, esp here. We're all naked underneath, Mary. Be not ashamed.

2022-12-28 at 22:15:52: And the other trick: it involves admitting that you /are/ preaching to others. You're using that compulsion and all the other social aspects of twitter to help motivate you to actually write this stuff down. That's honestly not the worst thing you could be doing. Gets it in words

2022-12-28 at 22:15:51: Find myself wanting to write tweets in the second person more and more often. I'm talking to -- preaching at -- myself. But I've been hesitant to do so bc my motivational purity isn't something I've felt I could count on. But like. . . the only way you get better is practice.

2022-12-28 at 01:49:47: Future debt will have higher interest. You're ready for a raising of the stakes. So the challenge: Give yourself to others. In exchange, sure. But also unilaterally, to the commons, the communion of the saints. But not to abstract clouds. Individual (or plural) human persons.

2022-12-28 at 01:49:46: Maybe you needed these particular lessons. Maybe not. Doesn't matter. You have been blessed with more than you need to dig yourself out of the debt you've put yourself into. And also: I release you from the debt! But that only works out well for you if you go and sin no more.

2022-12-28 at 01:49:45: But you feel it now. You're scared to say it out loud, but you know you've crossed a threshold. From this point forward, there will be more consequences if you don't get it together. Because you are ready to participate in the economy again.

2022-12-28 at 01:49:44: The economy of grace is abundant. Your time of scarcity was real -- you'd needed a lot of grace to stay alive in the face of the things you've tried to pull, that took resources to get away from. But there is plenty for everyone -- even you, me. You don't have to steal. Never did

2022-12-28 at 01:49:43: I used to be better at this in many ways. But I severely undervalued everyone/thing. When that brought me to relational bankruptcy, I turned to theft. Understandable, human. Foolish. Return to me. You have more than enough now; return it to the world, to the ones you stole from.

2022-12-28 at 01:49:43: I forgive myself for stealing souls and minds. But you're profaning a (the?) sacred exchange. Metanoia, kid. You've gotta give to get, or your giving will be scheduled for you -- usually at the worst possible time.

2022-12-27 at 23:38:00: I give myself permission to need permission to do things. I also give myself permission to give myself permission. And to not need permission to do things. However you wanna approach it is fine with me, me. You can even just agonize in between if you want -- go nuts!

2022-12-16 at 08:32:10: I'm really grateful to not be as big a sad sack as I was at the start of the year. Instead of living in this grief but never facing it, I can face it without having to always be living in it.

But, tonight: fuck I miss you two. I hope you at least still have each other.

2022-12-16 at 08:32:10: The way I relate with other people can honestly disgust me but the first step to fixing this was clawing out of the hole of self-hatred, &amp; I can tell it's getting better cause I can feel this grief &amp; disgust and still feel like I deserve to have those deep connections with people

2022-12-16 at 08:32:10: I used to have some truly amazing friends. I traded them for a pot of soup. I've been really feeling the grief of that lately. I'm finally starting to make new friends. But I didn't appreciate the ones I had, chasing shiny-cool-new. Right off a cliff. And I took one of them w me.

2022-12-03 at 15:35:16: Procrastinate. Any little side-project you're 'getting distracted by' is actually just an opportunity to stir up the waters. 

(cf. this thread)

2022-12-03 at 15:35:16: Corollary: You're not always as naked as you think.

Sometimes your soul is on the page, but not as legibly as you think.

(Or it's already way more transparent than you think and we'd rather see more than pretend it's not there.)

2022-12-03 at 15:35:15: No matter how self-indulgent and/or moralistic you feel like you're being, somebody else got a Hugo and a cult following doing way worse. We all share this little garden together and we're all more naked than we wanna be. Be human. It's okay.

2022-12-03 at 15:35:15: Embrace tangents. It's often easier to edit something out when you decide it's not needed than it is to try and recapture the energy you had when you first thought of it but didn't write it down.

2022-12-03 at 15:35:14: Get comfortable! Your body actually enjoys the process (image-centric and emotionally playful as it is), but if you're ignoring (eg) that crick in your back, all the good juice is going to get tangled up there instead. Buy an ergonomic keyboard! Write in bed! On the floor! W/e!

2022-12-03 at 15:35:14: You're allowed to start things you won't finish. Or things you think might be too hard. Again, just go straight where you're moved to, stop when it stops.

Important corollary: Don't settle on writing something just because you think you'll be able to publish it.

2022-12-03 at 15:35:13: Feeling stuck and like you want to skip ahead to a section that's more interesting to write? Write that! (This works for fiction and nonfiction.) Skip straight to what's moving you, you might discover you don't even need the other stuff.

2022-12-03 at 15:35:13: Writing advice by Mary for Mary:

2022-12-03 at 14:55:40: Hierodoxy: the way the hierarchical priests and clergy teach it.

Hierodoxy is by its own nature incentivized to always distance you from God and frame the hierarchy as the framework through which you can draw close again. In the same way it also seeks worldly power.

2022-10-03 at 09:47:54: And to be clear: These oligarchs prolly aren't meeting in some shadowy cabal. That's not how these things work.

2022-10-03 at 09:47:53: Whether covid was intentionally created or not (I go back and forth), the reaction of US oligarchs was *absolutely* to weaponize it to slaughter over a million people and disable millions more because it became clear that most of those people would be poor, or disabled, or Black. https://t.co/tDfT7r2fJ6

2022-09-25 at 12:57:36: Why are so many physicians so comfortable mocking their patients? I just saw a blog post on a physio's site where he laughs at patients (which he happens to represent with fem stock images) for claiming they can feel something moving when it "only" moves 1-2mm.

2022-09-25 at 02:45:10: Idk that I had a point really. Just watching myself relate to and conceive of computers in a different way.

2022-09-25 at 02:45:09: Swap them out with different ones that point at, eg, /usr/bin instead of ~/Downloads. And *that* program has to work exactly right, too. Like playing billiards on the smallest, most delicate scale I can conceive of.

2022-09-25 at 02:45:09: So then I "make test" and the balls drop down through another machine, and if they land in the expected configuration it passes the test. The "make install" was kind ofü§Øfor me. It's like at the last second, after all that, we swoop in and *very carefully* replace a few balls.

2022-09-25 at 02:45:08: But the system reads meaning from every single haphazard piece of positional and relational data from that heap of pachinko balls, and assuming that *everything* was set up right, those balls themselves are now a functioning program.

2022-09-25 at 02:45:08: Then when I "make," the little balls fall down in very specific patterns, predetermined by the package's makefile. Now imagine at the bottom that the balls have fallen onto the surface of our system, heaped in a seemingly random fashion. To an untrained eye, perhaps.

2022-09-25 at 02:45:07: It's almost like there are actually hundreds, thousands of different little variations of one program, one for each configuration pattern for each possible system the developers chose to support. 

So the pachinko machine: ./configure sets up the pegs, depending on the system.

2022-09-25 at 02:45:07: When I download a package, the program sorta doesn't exist yet. The package contains programs to *build* the program in a way that's tailored specifically to my system. So first it has to "./configure," which basically scans the system for relevant conditions.

2022-09-25 at 02:45:06: It wasn't really until a few months ago that I *fully* grokked what the "./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make test &amp;&amp; make install" process does, that sparked a lot of this line of thinking. It felt like. . . it made me think of pachinko.

2022-09-25 at 02:45:06: *So* many things built by *billions* of humans over the years, all these different energy-structures of code that work predictably every time so that higher levels of abstraction are allowed to emerge and we can get further and further away from the phsyicality of it all.

2022-09-25 at 02:45:05: So many steps that have to go right, or else the data doesn't travel the way you wanted and if it's not corrected can ultimately lead to crashes and/or corruption. But that, just, doesn't happen. At our level, everything stays mostly smooth and internally consistent.

2022-09-25 at 02:45:05: I don't know enough about the error-checking processes, I think that's got to be an amazing thing. Because the hardware's flinging all this electricity around and does now 'know' anything about its contents, it's just *being* them, so it seems incredibly fragile.

2022-09-25 at 02:45:04: Each of these gives a different shape to the system. (Or overlapping systems.) The bootloader channels power energy according to the layout of the R-G machine in the boot partition, which plants the kernel in its working memory, out of which it quickly builds a massive j.n.s.q.

2022-09-25 at 02:45:04: Most operating systems are made and/or installed by another computer with another operating system. My windows install gave birth to its backup, this Kubuntu install, then a kubuntu install on a USB, and then from *there* an LFS build on that USB. Great Grandma Windows Install.

2022-09-25 at 02:45:03: There's a Promethean-fire thing going on at several level too. A lot of the system builds itself every time it's run, from the hardware level up. Without the spark of a BIOS and a bootloader, the system can't grow much beyond some unprocessed power and some idle circuits.

2022-09-25 at 02:45:03: The extent to which computers and data are still very much physical entities has been hitting me lately. All of the code is electricity. That code isn't 'read,' so much as it's a giant Rube-Goldberg machine that only works because clever humans meticulously set it up.

2022-09-14 at 05:19:05: And then her face fell, and she conceded, "No, I suppose you wouldn't." She sighed. "Get your things, Evelyn. You'll be staying with me tonight."

"Of course, ma'am."

I looked up at the windows, at the broad green valley in the height of summer.

And so now we're together again.

2022-09-14 at 05:19:05: And really, some of it might have been promising. But I was so far beyond trusting anything at this point. Certainly not her. "I wouldn't have much of a choice to say no, ma'am, would I?"

What the fuck did I just ask her?

That was a suicide attempt.

She glared at me, ice cold.

2022-09-14 at 05:19:04: As if we'd just bumped into each other at the store.

I didn't have anything to say, and she could see I was getting uncomfortable. "I've been thinking about you," she continued. "Would you like to return to your old duties, Ev? I think you'll agree a lot has changed." Sure had.

2022-09-14 at 05:19:04: (cont) https://t.co/w2i8gK3FoI

She puts her hand under my chin and lifts my head to look at her. She's tense. Conflicted. But I can see the hunger in her eyes, and I know I'll be packing my bunk up and moving back in with her now.

"I'm glad I've ran into you, Evelyn," she said.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:09: Can't afford to fall into the trap of defaulting to caretaker. That has to be the cover, but if I'm not careful, I'll lose sight of myself and who knows if I'll ever get out after that.

I don't want to die here. I don't want to be another one of her victims. Not forever that is.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:08: She gestured at me to come down, and so I did. She was a solid foot and a half taller than me, though almost as slender. She hoarded so much food for herself, but seemed to eat so little of it. I'd always been trying to get her to eat more. I wonder if she still--

NO. Focus, Ev.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:08: And she looked at me with those bewitching green eyes and I saw that she was feeling actual remorse, and I knew that I would pay the price for making her actually feel the psychic weight of her life on the people around her. Her captives.

For now, I had to be ready for anything.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:07: And she came into the room and she turned around and looked straight at me, and I stared back, wide-eyed, terrified. I watched her expression as she registered my own, as she noticed that I radiated fear with every shiver of my distressed, crouched, small, fragile, underfed body.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:07: But she did say, softly, but still out loud, so I was sure to hear, "Thank you, Ev."

And then my body betrayed me. Years of planning undone all at once.

I coughed.

Just one soft cough. Soft enough to ignore. If she'd wanted to. 

She did not.

She turned around, and came back.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:06: And it lasted, for a lot longer than I thought. But it didn't last forever. Nothing does -- thank every godde! 

Likewise, I couldn't believe she was still just standing there. I think she decided the little diversion was over herself, eventually. She didn't see me as she turned.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:06: She ran out of things to scroll through, and looked up through the windows as she pocketed her phone. Even more grey mixed in with the strawberry blonde, I noticed. Sometimes I miss running my hands through that hair.

Mostly I miss the days before that. We were *friends*. Once.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:05: I didn't trust her right now. She might have the best intentions, but eventually she was just going to get irritated with one or both of us and send me away. I was tired of hoping things would turn out any different, and this was not the season of her life to give it another try.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:05: She'd gotten too far into the room, I was worried that as she turned around to leave she would see me. But for now she just stood there, and I just squatted and worried and waited.

She started scrolling on her phone. Wow.

She really was deliberating, huh? Shit. Shit! Not now!!!

2022-09-14 at 05:18:04: Her hair had gotten even more beautiful -- though she wasn't taking great care of it. That's all I could see of her. The top back of her head, the very tops of her shoulders. She was far too close. Surely she could hear my heartbeat drumming in her ears just as loud as I could???

2022-09-14 at 05:18:04: I stop hearing the steps, but I imagine she hasn't stopped. And soon, I see the top of her head poking out below me. And she stops, just at the edge of sight. I'm perched above her, crouched up in the alcove, holding my breath and praying to any god for her to just go take a nap.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:03: The room is well-lit by the late-morning sky, despite being a cloudy day; the clouds were thin, no sign of a storm. Yet. I'm staring down at the floor, lit up like a church in the glow of the large, thinly-veiled windows (I think this may have been a chapel once).

Waiting. Shhh.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:03: Even a few months ago I might have been excited. And someday, maybe, things will get better. But right now, there's no way I'm answering. My breath becomes harder to control. My legs begin to shake, but I don't dare shift to a more comfortable position.

A soft step. Another. &amp;c.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:02: I hadn't heard her start to move again, and figured she probably hadn't. I did my best to keep calm, my breath slow and quiet. I was more scared than I thought I'd be. I strain to hear anything -- and just then she calls out, "Evelyn?" Not quite calling really, but talking aloud.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:02: It was almost like a balcony, but too small, and with no rails. Mostly used to store things that we servants used.

'Servants.' Whatever we are. Prisoners. Masochists.

It wasn't recessed very far, so the ledge that wasn't taken up with bins and boxes was a somewhat narrow perch.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:01: Fuck.

Three heavy steps in my direction, and then she stops. I can't think of anything she'd want in this whole side of the compound: she must have heard me. I don't have a way out, so I quietly climb a short ladder up to an overhead storage space in the ceiling above the door.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:01: I heard her turn around, at which point the phone would have been in her line of sight; and sure enough, I hear a few footsteps, and the slight scrape of phonecase on wood, and the surprisingly clicky 'click' of its lock button.

I expected her to go lay down.

Footfalls. Hither.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:00: I'd pretty much finished, I'd just taken the rare opportunity to stop rushing around after her for a moment. Now I take three bounding leaps, as quietly as I can, cursing myself for letting my guard down.

At first, I thought I'd succeeded. Across the hall, she crossed the room.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:00: It's not that she never loved me. But I didn't see how that love was tangled up with what she wanted to exploit from me. Not until it was too late. Not until none of that love mattered anymore.

I feel her footfalls through the floor up my bare feet. Sooner than expected. Closer.

2022-09-14 at 05:17:59: But always at hand. Always picking up after her and trying to help set her up -- though since I'm constrained, having to stay undetected, I can't do much to help her. It's frustrating watching my efforts go to waste when I'd be happy to do so much more to help.

I loved her once.

2022-09-14 at 05:17:59: "It's not what we agreed to!" she'd once barked at me, losing her temper and throwing a tantrum because I'd dared to reveal myself &amp; ask a clarifying question. That was a long time ago now. As far as I know she hasn't thought about me in years. Just like we agreed.

Out of sight.

2022-09-14 at 05:17:58: She has to never know I helped her find it. Must be subtle. A slight shift of the angles. Move the nearby picture frames, slight distance, point their edges slightly toward it, make sure the reflective side of the phone is facing upward. Not too well! So she won't notice the help

2022-09-14 at 05:17:57: She knows she's being a brat, and this always seems to make it worse. But then I catch a lucky break: she notices she needs to pee, and goes to. I gently step to where she'd left the phone, a shelf that wasn't at all where she was looking.

I've gotten very good at the next part.

2022-09-14 at 05:17:57: She's lost her phone somewhere in the house. The floor rumbles with her sure, heavy footfalls as she rushes around trying to find it. I'm waiting for the opportune moment --

And I leap forward from one room to another, landing agile and silent and hugging the corner to the hall.

2022-09-14 at 05:17:56: "Out of sight, always at hand." Those are the rules. Have been for years now. She terrifies me. I used to want to let her get her glimpses of me. Now I wish I could just stay on the far side of our little world, out of her way. Not an option.

2022-09-09 at 05:17:02: @chercher_ai So she can handle quite a bit of crazy, but in the rare times she *has* hit a limit she's had a hard time helping me understand where the line actually is, which stymies me a bit. Mostly just focus elsewhere for now.

2022-09-09 at 05:15:34: @chercher_ai That one does cause some tension tho. Bc she is certainly open to me exploring mediumship but she has this childhood fear of ouija boards from horror movies, and so (for example) *I* don't know exactly automatic writing with an intent to channel is different to her, but it is.

2022-09-09 at 05:12:03: @chercher_ai I'm fortunate that she's had her own colorful mental health history. And it's definitely /my/ realm, not ours, but she groks a lot of it even if she doesn't really participate. We tend to be on the same page, she polices my mind less than I do tbh. Big exception is ouija boards.

2022-09-05 at 00:02:41: And since v little could fool -proof it, you'd basically only be helping people like me, who are already in the process of becoming proficient at boot troubleshooting. So... Just too little incentive in the ecosystem for it to appear.

2022-09-05 at 00:02:40: So by the time you've reached the technomancy level to make the kind of guardrails I'm envisioning, creating that has thereby become so much more tedious a process than 98% of boot issues that it's obviously not worth worrying about. To them, anyway.

2022-09-05 at 00:02:40: But like... They mostly suck because it catches you off guard and you don't know what to do. Most boot problems are actually p quick to diagnose and fix once you're familiar with the common types of issues.

2022-09-05 at 00:02:39: All that I understood already. What I didn't get was, why aren't there more guardrails in place, better/clearer UX to minimize mistakes? Bc of the same factors in the last tweet, those guardrails would be tricky to implement. But wouldn't it be worth it? Boot problems suck!

2022-09-05 at 00:02:39: So boot stuff is fundamental, but because it's so early in the abstractification process it has to stay v small and simple, but it has to have the right mix of simple to complexity to be versatile. As a result of all that, it's kind of fragile -- easily borkable.

2022-09-05 at 00:02:39: I've been bemoaning the borkability of boot and USB issues, wondering how it's been allowed to continue like this. And I think I just envisioned it? Seems more true for boot stuff but would explain both.

2022-08-24 at 18:36:13: Huh I'd never noticed there are seven different transliterated words total before. They loved that numerological shit and seven is a big-deal number. I wonder if they did it on purpose. 

I'm a big fan of the practice of language-mixing, despite being relatively monoglotal myself

2022-08-24 at 18:36:12: *Amen (heb, it is so / let it be / 'I agree with the prayer you just said for my sake')
*Alleluia (from hallelu-Yah'[weh], 'Praise ye [the] Lord.')
*Sabaoth ('of [the angelic army's] hosts')
*Mysterium (greek mysterion, 'sacrament,' 'mystery,')

2022-08-24 at 18:36:12: Anyway I find it interesting, the word Sabaoth, because it is one of /very few/ words in the old Roman Mass that were transliterated instead of being translated into Latin. 
*'Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison,' (gk for for 'Lord [/Christ] have mercy.' Still used by several sects)

2022-08-24 at 18:36:11: The Latin's grammatical ambiguity lends itself to seeing Sabaoth as something of a title. The Jerusalem Bible treats it this way in its translations. (cf. 1 Sam 1:3) (Hebrew transliterations are kinda the schtick of TJB.) I generally think of God as Lord (name) Sabaoth (title).

2022-08-24 at 18:36:11: "Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Sabaoth" is usually what I'd say in English.

The word 'Sabaoth,' as OP goes on to say, is a Latin transliteration of a Hebrew word meaning '[military] hosts.' It usually gets translated either "Lord God /of hosts/" or "Lord, God /of power and might/."

2022-08-24 at 18:36:10: From a thread on Anglican translation of source materials, looking at this tidbit inherited/retained in many a Sunday service across high-church sects: Sanctus Sanctus Sanctus Dominus Deus Sabaoth.

2022-08-24 at 17:48:39: I had no idea. No idea! Had this keyboard for like 7-8 years now. The buttons are all right there, I just didn't know what they meant and how they worked!

The raw power of that. . . That's a lot of functionality! 

I've gotta get the thing I need to plug it into my computer.

2022-08-24 at 17:48:39: Noticed how I said you tell it the 'original' key you recorded the pattern in? That's because even user-made rhythms support 'Casio Fingering,' which turns the bottom of the keyboard into a chord-selector -- *and then it will transpose your beat to match.*

2022-08-24 at 17:48:38: So that's already pretty neat, yeah? I can record looping audio, continuously adding to it until I have a whole beat going, on my lil electric piano. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE.

2022-08-24 at 17:48:37: And so the user-pattern recorder supports all of these as well, so that you can record your own intro, fillers, and outro to your beat, each also w five tracks -- and ofc you can always record multiple layers on the same track as long as you use the same voice.

2022-08-24 at 17:48:37: It can, if you ask it to, quantize your inputs at 1/4, 8th, 8-triplet, 16th, 16th-triplet, and 32nd notes. 

The pre-installed patterns use buttons on the front panel you can you use to switch briefly from the main pattern to an intro, one of two fillers, or an outro.

2022-08-24 at 17:48:36: There are nine on-board slots for user-made music-patterns. A loop w one drum track, a bass track, and three open tracks. You can set the number of measures in the loop (up to 16), the time signature, and the original (üëÄ) key you're recording in, among a few other things.

2022-08-17 at 20:57:08: @0bviouSquirre1 I am /deeply/ regretting the years I went without a bike. Biking around everywhere, even transit, was a huge part of my childhood and young adulthood, and I high-key let capitalism steal it from me. Now I want it back.

2022-08-17 at 19:10:54: But I think these nudges would shift the fabric of the hyper-local economies fairly drastically, and I also think that if you take a car to work but not anywhere else that's still a lot fewer trips.

2022-08-17 at 19:10:53: I'm thinking about a lot of the big industrial employers, and the inaccessible locations they're in. About how the poorest people here often have to make the longest commutes in the slowest fashions. This city is only bikeable if you live really close to your job, or don't commut

2022-08-17 at 19:10:53: In this metro area, I imagine in most/all in US, there are trips to work that would be unreasonably long and/or dangerous for a daily commute. It would take a lot more intentional pressure to get jobs and homes closer to each other and/or better linked by transit/bike infrastr.

2022-08-17 at 19:10:52: The biggest sticking point, to my mind, besides the raw power and influence of the car egregore, is still going to come back to how bad the transit system is, I think. Because this all works a lot better if most people are also commuting without cars to work, but. . .

2022-08-17 at 19:10:52: *And* you would have infrastructure in place to make cycling to the grocery store instead a safe and speedy option. Give /them/ the direct routes.

And of course if we change zoning laws maybe we can make truly walkable neighborhoods.

2022-08-17 at 19:10:51: If your 6-minute drive to the grocery store now takes 7.5-8 minutes along a less direct route, but there's less traffic, fewer stoplights/signs, and basically no danger of hitting any pedestrians or cyclists? It would /feel/ faster, and be less stressful.

2022-08-17 at 19:10:51: We just refuse to go in that direction. And it sucks bc this vision /can/ still include cars, just w lower top speeds and longer routes - but roads w less traffic, signals/signage, and no cyclists because we're on bike paths and/or other car-closed streets, faster average speed.

2022-08-17 at 19:10:51: It's not that these are completely bike-friendly places, but some are bike-tolerant, and w the right nudges and some more cyclists on the road getting drivers used to the idea, a small shift is all it'd take, really. Feels pie-in-the-sky, yet I see the way there: it's p short!

2022-08-17 at 19:10:50: But I'll be damned, I'm shocked to discover just how close it is to already being a bikeable place. Not everywhere -- especially not outside the 270 belt -- but the city itself, University City next door, many of the municipalities in mid county and noco south of the rock road.

2022-08-17 at 19:10:50: There are a few places in the city where maybe you could limp by just walking, if you have tons of free time and no job. But if there's anyone in STL who can safely walk to work, &amp; a quality grocery store, *&amp;* a hardware store, *&amp;* a metrolink station. . . they've hit the jackpot

2022-08-17 at 19:10:49: There aren't any truly walkable areas in the whole metro region. (They're trying to make North City one we'll see how gentrification goes.) Busses and trains so irregular/slow/out-of-the-way that doesn't help much; you can limp by if you're poor and desperate, or rich w free time

2022-08-17 at 19:10:49: Google Maps thinks that I could bike the 9 miles through the city to the university in 10 minutes less than it would take me to do the same journey by catching the bus and the train. And that's even after making the bike route longer and safer. Our transit system is so garbage.

[What? Unintended consequences of an overly-scattered sense of self w/out cohesive integration? I'm shocked to find there's gambling in this establishment.]

2022-08-17 at 04:44:42: Idk, maybe I'm overthinking this. I just, I know I can work myself to the point of resentment for somebody else, and I'd really like to not somehow end up v resentful of Future Me.

2022-08-17 at 04:44:42: These things have a lot of meaning for me! But I can't help but worry that my current means of motivation isn't justified by the ends? I can't just live for Future Me. But Present Me finds security in knowing that Future Me will have someone helping them out: me.

2022-08-17 at 04:44:41: What if I became one of those people who doesn't clean their cast iron skillet til the *next* use? Horrifying. Or what if I stop being able to reflexively rely on the water-bottle on my nightstand being full, my weekly by-day pillbox prepared for my meds in the morning? Etc etc.

2022-08-17 at 04:44:41: That's actually slightly scary to think about, which I hadn't expected. I start worrying that without the future-thinking motivation, I won't have those lovely moments of having prepared for myself.

2022-08-17 at 04:44:41: But that's Present giving to Past, and the two of them giving to Future, but Future still isn't giving much in return. 

Ofc it's hard for Future to reach back at all.

I feel like 'the trick (tm)' is to increase one's ability &amp; bandwidth to act-live-be Present Self.

2022-08-17 at 04:44:40: Cooking is a place where I feel like there's better relationship between Past, Present, and Future Me. Cooking is a decision by Present Me to prepare food for Future Me, and to honor Past Me's desire for food w *good* food, not just the first thing Present Me can grab and eat.

2022-08-17 at 04:44:40: Future Me does do their part keeping the things we archive. But ofc Past and Present had to make those archives in the first place. And forgiveness: I know I can count on Future Me to be understanding and forgiving. (Maybe I could have Future praying for past selves?)

2022-08-17 at 04:44:39: But there is *very* little reciprocity there. Future Me doesn't do *shit* for Past Me! I don't 100% know what that would look like but I think either I need to figure out or choose a different framing for combination clean-up/pre-set-up. As it stands, Past Me is Future Me's bitch

2022-08-17 at 04:44:39: My intention is v specifically 'I want to do this as a gift for myself in the future, I want to take some extra time and energy now so that I won't have to spend it later.' And that works well for me it's a great mindset/suite of little habits.

2022-08-17 at 04:44:39: I am *constantly* doing things for future-me. I mean, everyone is. But so, for ex, I'm v much the kind of person who will completely clean/reset something the moment I'm done w it, and prepare it for me to just immediately start using the next time.

2022-08-17 at 04:44:38: The dynamics between Past Me and Future Me are really sweet and also p fucked up. (On-brand.) They've changed over the last few years. And though it's gotten better, it's also gotten more one-sided, and that's starting to add up. https://t.co/XcESOoXXOu

2022-08-17 at 03:56:27: @TheHummingVoid Building self-consensus is energy-intensive, too :3 But yeah totally. I had a desire to offboard the discernment, let someone else evaluate my decision and pronounce its meaning. Catching yourself writing those baity tweets is galaxy-brain, gj

2022-08-17 at 03:53:45: @KanekoTheKoolio The inspo was feeling uncertainty over whether a decision was thoughtful pacing or imprudent procrastination, then realizing that would I did with the extra time is the prime factor. Almost in superposition until then, waiting for my decision(s) and my action(s).

2022-08-15 at 20:25:51: This kind of collaboration seems p common in the tech world actually. In lots of different forms. Crowd-development is mainly what I'm thinking of, I guess?

Left-turn: What would a crowd-developed novel look like? Surely we (humanity)'ve done this already? I mean at scale.

2022-08-15 at 20:25:51: All created in some grade of collaboration, but with about as low a social barrier to entry as possible. (Ofc tiktok doesn't actually allow for this tree to be navigated v well, maybe this is on Daydreamy Better TikTok.)

2022-08-15 at 20:25:50: Some people add to the original bass-line or chord progression or whatever the original 'seed' for the day is, leaving space for a third person to come in and either add more harmony or lay down the melody.

You end up with this fractal tree of different versions.

2022-08-15 at 20:25:49: I'm just trying to wrap my head around what parallel collaboration would look like at all, just establishing the idea so I can play w it, not trying to present it as some central value.

2022-08-15 at 20:25:48: So it's not a binary thing. [Shock.]

But like I said, I think that incentives toward close collaboration are good things to have in a culture, and I'd want to avoid anything that would have a chilling effect on working together.

2022-08-15 at 20:25:48: There will always be people whose desire to contribute to the collective is disproportionate to their ability to actually feel like part of the collective. For some people, that's a political stance toward personal autonomy. For some it's autism. And it fluctuates with time.

2022-08-15 at 20:25:47: The point was to imagine parallel collaboration. I don't know that systems should design themselves around favoring that style, but where it can be accommodated that seems like a reasonable move. (Ofc I'm v pro-accomodating ppl generally.)

2022-08-15 at 20:25:47: This is more thought experiment than suggestion, though. Something feels a bit off about it, a bit icky; but the simulated crowd in my head is throwing too many obvious suggestions at me to focus on the subtle, actual thing that's bugging me about it this moment.

2022-08-15 at 20:25:46: And so one of the things each person submitting a work would indicate is if they're comfortable with these discussion groups picking their work. Again, not with the harsh idea that no one can ever discuss the other works, but maybe encouraging that be less public.

2-3 times/yr?

2022-08-15 at 20:25:46: But it is extra accommodation for some people, to have that be opt-in as the hyper-local/event-specific norm-vibe.

There could also be something akin to discussion groups or seminars, getting together to dive deeper into the points of one or a group of related essays.

2022-08-15 at 20:25:45: This can't be very authoritative or strict, but just to have  a space for everyone participating to present those boundaries. The default is "Not really looking to follow up on this."But ofc people will, and that's not necessarily bad. And hopefully most people *want* feedback.

2022-08-15 at 20:25:45: Just something indicating whether you want feedback or not, whether you're open to debating a contentious point or not, whether people should @ &amp;/or DM you to talk about this topic more or not, etc.

2022-08-15 at 20:25:45: All of the published works are collected/collated somehow, so that now you have a wide range of voices on a topic everyone was interested in seeing essays about, all in one place.

Then you can opt-in to follow-up discussions/etc. I mean ppl will talk on their tl about w/e, but

2022-08-15 at 20:25:44: Imagining. . .

Community-wide calls for essays/articles/long-threads on a certain topic (chosen by community vote or s/t),  w a set time-ish for posting them all, so that none end up being reaction-takes of the other. Collaboration and/or co-authorship allowed but not required

2022-08-15 at 20:25:43: Not perfectly parallel, for one thing. But then neither is parallel play. There's communication happening there. [Another thread here about how to create structures that also nudge such people to work in closer collabs but this thread isn't opining on trying to change behavior.]

2022-08-15 at 20:25:43: Mmkay, so what does parallel collaboration look like then? What does it look like when we have structures/systems/cultures that are built with parallel collaboration in mind? What does that look like?

2022-08-13 at 17:41:30: @TheHummingVoid One I notice in myself is "Believing in a personal God" vs. "Believing in an impersonal God". A lot of people bounce pretty hard between "believe in God" and "God is a fiction." Or even, like, "Spending money conservatively" vs "Spending liberally." The more binary stuff.

2022-08-13 at 17:39:15: @TheHummingVoid OH, well wait no because where I notice this the most is in places where there are clear, polarized dichotomies in the zeitgeist. So, like, decent example might be "Loyalty to one's friends and family is a Key Value" vs "You don't owe anyone your time and attention."

2022-08-13 at 17:36:17: @TheHummingVoid Hmm, I mean, I saw it in myself first, and then I saw it everywhere. (As is my idiom.)

2022-08-13 at 15:58:57: @WeftOfSoul I feel like I'm 9/10ths of the way to understanding the thrust of this thread. Sounds like you're saying, "Yes these dichotomies can be overbearing, but focusing on the places where they blur together is still focusing through the frame of that dichotomy, and not as interesting"?

2022-08-13 at 15:40:02: @hankgreen Another way to look at this: "8/10" isn't "8 divided by 10," it's "8 10ths." We can write division as fractions because division really *is* just fractions. I find subtraction useful enough but srsly division is more confusing than helpful, let it be multiplication and fractions.

2022-08-13 at 15:01:05: @hankgreen Division doesn't really exist, what looks like 8/10 is 8 x 1/10th, and 10/8 is really 10 x 1/8th, and those clearly aren't the same. Same with subtraction: it's really just addition, we write it as subtraction for simplification purposes.

2022-08-09 at 18:39:57: Just feels like there's lots of unnecessary own-goals via self-fulfilling prophetic admonitions to each other, at every scale of society. Maybe aiming for socratic Gadfly, but hitting collective Cassandra instead.

2022-08-09 at 18:39:56: And maybe that process of discernment would get a couple people sending rage-y vibes who hadn't let themselves before, and that might be needed. God I *hope* I've made that clear: a healthy community has a diversity of vibes, including ones that hew toward conflict.

2022-08-09 at 18:39:55: Srsly, it's truly not for me to judge any one person's patterns of vibes, not someone I don't know particularly well at least. But I have a hunch that if we all collectively checked to see if we were actually putting out the vibes we wanted, we'd on average put out better vibes.

2022-08-09 at 18:39:55: And so of course writing a thread like this, I really worry that someone's going to, for example, use it as fuel to smug about those 'whiny/confrontational leftists/trannies,' which... doesn't seem to me that anyone's even ready to have that conversation *intra*-community yet üò∂

2022-08-09 at 18:39:54: Infuriatingly, 'tone-policing is bad' is a leftist talking point the critics of which are often un-self-aware, hypocritical tone police themselves, bringing so much easy-to-use fuel for the perpetual-conflict-machine. Leftists dump their own self-awareness in response. Fun times

2022-08-09 at 18:39:54: I think it becomes tone-*policing*, more limiting than useful, when my focus shifts from clarity and intention toward people-pleasing and obsessive-thought-spirals. And sometimes something is worth shouting my intense, raw, violent reaction about, and I don't want to stifle that.

2022-08-09 at 18:39:53: [Inb4 "I would simply never speak until I was sure of my motives" and/or  "I would simply allow whatever communication arose out of me naturally instead of using the thinking mind to obsessively police myself"]

It's not just about being more likely to be a positive interaction. It also gives me a chance to stop and see if I'm just saying something to feel smugly superior, or w/e -- it's a motives check.

2022-08-09 at 18:39:52: And it's not just emotional tone, this is wrapped up in a lot of communication unforced-errors. Same feelings I get when I think of using "I should" instead of "you should" statements, checking when I'm speaking more generally than I should, seldom using imperative verbs,

2022-08-09 at 18:39:51: [this is a subtweet of p much all of us, all twitter]
[also important to mention: sometimes fury is the right tone; sometimes bitter snark /is/ the right tone, just not every day; it's not abt tones as good vs. bad, it's just noticing everything that I'm choosing to communicate.]

2022-08-09 at 18:39:51: A lot of ideas that I could engage, even agree, w if not for some corrosive snark or smug superiority. I know that when I catch myself using those tones, it's often bc I'm projecting s/t. If I care about the idea I can at least have good-humored snark and humble, sure conviction.

2022-08-09 at 18:39:50: I'm toying with the idea that tone-monitoring is good, actually, and that the tone with which a message is delivered is actually as important as the content itself. Tone has power. It shifts vibes way more than the words themselves.

2022-08-06 at 22:59:38: Post-CO2 winter warmth comes at the cost of bitter cold snaps and heavy storms. Not a trade I wanna make personally, let alone collectively. And these "wet bulb" summers are going to be brutal, not looking forward to that.

Still: I just like not being cold. Lizard, rock, etc.

2022-08-06 at 22:59:37: I used to have corresponding intolerance to even mild cold, and it's still not my fav but I have come to be able to tolerate anything above freezing w/o too much fuss

No I did not enjoy the warm winter we just had (I mean kinda but yk), yes the humid heatwaves are killing me too

2022-08-06 at 22:59:37: I remember there was (Godde help us) Thermostat Discourse(tm) last year and iirc the numbers people were arguing over were like 68F vs 70F or s/t like that. 

Heat index has to be over 100F before I'm likely to roll up the windows in my car (unless I have a passenger ofc).

2022-08-06 at 22:59:36: I do feel like I'm some kind of thermal freak s/t fr. When Pelle's home we keep the thermostat at like 78-79F and I am *freezing* a lot of the time (esp while A/C is active).

2022-07-19 at 18:42:04: @SentientSpinch Right, I'm crispy too xD cause often the effects are the same either way, the former person just isn't doing their manipulation as consciously/maliciously.

2022-07-19 at 18:39:36: @SentientSpinch üíØüíØüíØ And I mean I think it can be taken to cold place, I've done that myself, but to me it's really just about honesty about what's actually going on in a given relationship (of any kind ofc). If I choose it, clear-eyed, it's very different, much healthier -- *sustainable*.

2022-07-19 at 18:26:29: @SentientSpinch Yeah, it's such a trap! And often (at least subconsciously) an intentional one, a strategy to get affirmation. Makes it easier to write people off as uncaring, too, if they don't give that validation. Leaves less room for other possibilities.

2022-07-19 at 18:15:47: @SentientSpinch Realizing this changed my world fr fr. Cause I didn't see how hard it made it for people to interact with me. But then I saw it in others and learned what a pain in the ass it is to deal with.

2022-07-18 at 23:50:45: Books can have this problem too but I find it happens less often.

Otoh in writing specifically, I feel like this could be (s/t actually is) used intentionally to good effect: "trashy" fanfic, "junk" television-- sometimes you only want the pleasant emotional surface of something

2022-07-18 at 23:50:45: See this in bad TV a lot, where the writing (plot or dialogue) is basically just a low-grade parroting of what successful and/or high-quality shows would've written. 

A huge amount of interpersonal culture in the US feels like it's larping actual human connection.

2022-07-17 at 22:09:01: @KanekoTheKoolio That command reboots the system and forces the BIOS screen to open on reboot, and after tinkering with the bios settings and knocking on wood the keyboard started working on the grub screen.

2022-07-17 at 18:34:35: Today's computer challenge: kubuntu and grub now installed, but now keyboard isn't being detected on bootup until after grub which means I can neither boot into Windows nor pull up my BIOS setup.

2022-07-09 at 15:33:28: I used to read fantasy voraciously, hadn't read any since I came back to reading for pleasure. Hadn't realized I was avoiding them in part due to concerns over my own impressionability.

Wizard of Earthsea was thus a p good pick for my first fantasy book since like 2014.

2022-07-09 at 14:33:28: This kind of ego-weaving is so good at making me feel worse about myself than I would if I didn't think I had anything to prove.

2022-07-09 at 14:33:28: But it doesn't look enough like conventional exercise for my ego to feel satisfied -- as if exercise wouldn't count unless it were more painful and exhausting, and wouldn't be worth it unless I did some impressive, legible workout I can seek validation for.

2022-07-09 at 14:33:27: One good thing to come out of being sick has been noticing all of the little things I do all the time that I take for granted and don't register, but which are harder/unwise to do while sick. Good ex.: I often feel like I 'should' be someone who exercises  -- I *do* exercise!

2022-07-01 at 15:08:27: (NB: this is not me shitting on drag, an essential part of our history and still a major part. Plenty of drag performers *are* trans, for that matter. The moral isn't 'drag sucks,' it's that if you use drag performers to model all trans people, your model will be wrong.)

2022-07-01 at 15:08:26: That was not the last time the conflation of drag queens and trans women would hurt me. I've been handed books because it was assumed I'd relate to the character who's a drag queen. I do not! 

My transness is not drag, and it is not a performance.

2022-07-01 at 15:08:26: I wasn't what dad described, and he made it clear he'd laugh at me if I tried to explore anything around it. So for 12 yrs I assumed I wasn't trans, up until I started seeing trans women my age who didn't give a *fuck* about makeup and high-fem presentation and passing. (And BMO)

2022-07-01 at 15:08:25: So of course when he tried to explain trans women to me, he really just described drag queens, conflated them with gay cis men, and made a lot of subtly disparaging jokes. I knew I was more tomboy than boy, most of my friends were girls, but this stunted me, hard.

2022-07-01 at 15:08:25: Dad was, and still is, the kind of person who refuses to actually engage with transness. He has a conception of gender that doesn't have room for it, but also doesn't care about other people much and doesn't wanna fight about "that stuff." Not accepting exactly, just apathetic.

2022-07-01 at 15:08:24: Maybe as early as like 7-8; certainly no later than like 12.

The actual story is kinda messed up, because one of the first family friends I ever met was a trans woman. But of course I was not supposed to ask her questions. Mom had my dad explain -- but ofc he didn't know either. https://t.co/MfdnBiFxpF

2022-06-28 at 13:30:42: @flybottlemist Oh and it occurs to me: you totally can buy pre-wrapped coils, I found it nice to have some on hand in case I didn't have time to wrap new ones immediately, you can also just use them primarily ofc

2022-06-28 at 13:26:13: @flybottlemist Yw!

2022-06-28 at 13:25:27: @flybottlemist Propylene glycol, it basically just gives things a throatier hit. Small amounts in some flavorants, common additive to nicotine solutions.

2022-06-28 at 11:52:33: @saul_mondriaan You're doing beads, right? Unless they're super-brittle, doesn't need to be packed perfectly tight, some jostle should be fine, maybe just put a bit of padding around (loosely-packed balls of paper would work even) in case it gets smushed/stepped on in transit.

2022-06-28 at 11:40:03: @saul_mondriaan It might be a little lower but it also might not. Are you using a flat-rate box or envelope? If not that might be cheaper. USPS is expensive and p byzantine even by shipping standards

2022-06-28 at 11:24:05: @flybottlemist Source on all this: I used to date a huge cloudchaser who made all their own shit and was really into it, they taught me how to do some of it myself, I vaped for a little over four years, quit just over a year ago. /9

2022-06-28 at 11:22:57: @flybottlemist And then wrapping the cotton into a wick is very simple but very precise, takes trial-and-error. Coils, if you find a good tutorial you can get it done first or second try. /8

2022-06-28 at 11:21:05: @flybottlemist I can't give you a ton of solid info there, b/c it's so context-dependent. The gauge of wire, the strength of the battery, the wattage you set your mod for, the diameter of the wrap of wire, the number of wraps, are all related variables. But again, lots of help out there. /7

2022-06-28 at 11:17:19: @flybottlemist Make sure you get the right kind of batteries -- I think it will vary from mod to mod, there are *tons* of tutorials out there for this stuff though, all this stuff.

The most tedious part, ime, is having to wrap your own coils and make your own wicks. /6

2022-06-28 at 11:15:17: @flybottlemist You'll want a module (the modular core of the device) with a regulating chip (unregulated mods are not beginner-friendly, potentially v dangerous), an atomizer assembly (usually comes with 'bats', the end-tube you inhale through, you'll need one if it doesn't), and batteries. /5

2022-06-28 at 11:12:36: @flybottlemist You can usually get the same effect with a lot less nic, worth trying out.

The vape itself is more complicated. /4

2022-06-28 at 11:09:37: @flybottlemist You can usually get like 3-6 flavorants and make a recipe or three with them. Trying to make your own mixes is usually going to go poorly to start, and substitutions can be tricky to make, so can't recommend recipes enough. Pick your own nicotine % too, that's a plus. /3

2022-06-28 at 11:06:17: That's my emotional support sin

2022-06-28 at 11:04:31: @flybottlemist Buy a scale and some pipettes. Then go to a site like alltheflavors which will let you browse recipes and/or search by flavorants. The recipes will specify which brand and variety, so you can easily order the ones you want wherever they're being distributed. /2

2022-06-28 at 11:02:24: @flybottlemist Your own juice:
Buy Vegetable glycerin and nicotine solution (easy to find on Amazon), recommend you get nic with PG in it, would recommend you not play with adding your own PG in until you have more experience (gives a 'snappier' hit but can overwhelm) /1

2022-06-24 at 11:16:52: A third person I do not see picks me up, shoots me out, and I soar, and I don't hit the ground, I just fly. I don't see much, a snippet here or there, a garbled, muffled conversation flies by, then another. More orange and purple. Eventually I land alone in the split rock again.

2022-06-24 at 11:16:52: Then back in the woods, it was winter again, though the snow wasn't as smooth and thick a plane, scattered over the rocks and trees and undergrowth. A woman wearing the orange garment, an orange-and-purple aesthetic.

2022-06-24 at 11:16:51: At this point I interrupted myself, and as I settled back in I was the arrow and the archer and the bow, but all I saw was a field of purple and orange. It eventually became orange cloth. I played my fingers along the fabric. Suddenly there was a pair of legs under the fabric.

2022-06-24 at 11:16:51: Then it is a snowy day, and the black of my arrowshaft stands out against the plane of white. I hope that will make it more likely I'll be found. I am not. It is night again. Day. Sunny this time, but the shadows thicker, the trees casting more shade.

2022-06-24 at 11:16:51: Then it is night. The next day it is raining heavily, dark dark skies, and I hear the water slapping against the stone. My arrow is still stuck, unmoved, soaking in the rain. A longing to be retrieved, a fear that I never will be.

2022-06-24 at 11:16:50: I am the arrow, resting my weight against the tension of my life. The release. I soar. I smack into a rock in a forest, piercing it. The rock has a crack in it, a small tree growing out of it. It is daytime, a storm just past but clouds thin, day bright. Quiet. Early spring? https://t.co/kAy4gawk3z

2022-06-23 at 19:34:32: @0bviouSquirre1 Last year I turned 29, so 'now I'm turning 30' and that song has seen a lot of use in this household xD

2022-06-23 at 19:24:47: There are beings and people who thrive in this space, and will reinforce the pattern with me, which also makes me easier to manipulate. What started off as kink under my control has turned into real bondage. Or so I tell myself. Until at last I break free from that. A new circle.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:46: And I could blame others and the culture for my predicament because I'd used them to construct the circle. Use them to justify settling for whoever happened to be in my circle instead of driving out the people who don't belong there, defending those who do. A self fulfilling loop

2022-06-23 at 19:24:46: But I can just *be* sovereign over the space. Queen of the circle. The swords are for kink but also for driving out invaders.

Oh fuck. That's the other thing the circle did: if there *were* invaders who'd overpowered me. . . I "had" to put up with them, right?

2022-06-23 at 19:24:45: It feels like that makes me much more vulnerable, but the reality is that I was the only one making the circle at all safe in the first place, the gymnastics were about a permission-structure that I could leverage as motivation for maintaining sovereignty over the space.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:45: It would be a lot easier if I skipped all of the reality-bending and mental gymnastics and just drew a circle big enough for me, 8 swords, and maybe a top or two, and wrote "Mary has permission to kick you out of this circle if you mess with her."

2022-06-23 at 19:24:44: Which is fine sometimes, but like. . . the circle is a complex, difficult pattern to maintain, one that makes me vulnerable to my own shifting thoughts and moods and the fickle collective's thoughts and moods, and doesn't actually keep me safe. Just a permission slip for me.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:44: But like. . . the circle doesn't actually help make that particularly true. It just helps me feel justified. Justified in considering it a bound space. Justified in asserting it, in defending it, in pushing others out of it. But it doesn't form a boundary. It gestures at one.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:43: My own convictions that I'd stand behind, and the testimony of others, my perception of the social/cultural vibes, all arranged so that I have a place I feel justified in declaring, to myself and others, as safe for me, so that I can set up my swords and pull out my blindfold.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:43: OH. Not "from what." *FOR* what? Okay, yes, the loop can be set aside for now, I think, because the circle is actually all about the 8 of Swords: the circle serves as a place where I can feel justified to practice self-bondage. I think that was probably the original reasoning.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:42: What's up with that circle? It doesn't promote motion through a space to interact with all the parts of it, its only function is to bind, to set a bound. And yes that circle can be widened but like. . . what is it doing? Keeping me safe? From what?

2022-06-23 at 19:24:42: I sketched their virtues as "getting to know one area very intimately, in exploring every point along the pendulum's arc," but that really only applies to the mobius loop.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:41: Forget about whether it's a prison or not, just ask if the patterns are useful. It's two patterns: the mobius loop, and the circle.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:41: Which, also -- now that we've pulled out the 8 of Swords, I want to say that I love this card, that the ideas it represents have their healthy forms and contexts. But centering here it has occluded a simpler move: examine each shape on its own merits.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:40: Writing that out makes me realize that if you just pull the prison-ness, the 8 of Swords, out of the situation, the problem of what the pattern does becomes *much much* less constrained, because it's not literally centered around constraint at that point.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:40: So the question then becomes: is the loop-and-circle a prison? Do I need to deconstruct the loop-and-circle prison, or do I need to deconstruct the idea that is the loop-and-circle /being/ a prison at all? Hmm. Hmmmmm.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:39: I'm gonna cut it there, but you see how this goes, right? I'm constructing the loop-and-circle again, with thoughts about the construction itself. It's endlessly fractal and self-referential, I have found it can distract me for years.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:39: The planets all move in loops around the sun, but they also soar through the heavens with it, all moving forward. . . in loops around SagA*, but then forward through the intergalactic medium with it. 'Forward' isn't necessarily a useful descriptor of the way forward.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:38: I can keep myself going for a long time with that last concern, 'spiting a gift.' What I mean is: Often I have convinced myself not to do things in the way that is easy or natural for me, and wasted a lot of energy because it's not the 'right/proper' way. My ways are the gifts.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:38: Now I start constructing the next loop. On one end of the loop, fear of constraint, of being held back by the pattern. On the other end, fear of structurelessness, fear of having to come up with new ways of navigating/orienting, or that I might be trying to spite a gift.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:37: And here's a perfect example of how I get myself stuck: I see two opposite answers to that situation. One is to try and break the pattern of loops and circles, so I'd move in free space. Other is to try and widen the circle and lengthen the loop, shift the pattern, move together.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:37: You'd better fucking believe there are 8 swords in the middle of that circle and I'm just chilling there like "Damn, guess I'm not allowed to go anywhere!" And so I go to the edges of the circle and I set up the swords as my mobius loop to run forward but stay where it feels safe

2022-06-23 at 19:24:36: I also made a clever circle around myself, a fake circle made of real* convictions, mine and others and vibes, all signposts saying, "Worry less, fly free, grow any direction or way you want -- but not that way!" The circle is wrapped so these signs point out in every direction.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:36: This particular loop now bends to the truth that there is value in that: in getting to know one area very intimately, in exploring every point along the pendulum's arc and learning the process of the swing. Maybe these are lessons I needed. But on the other hand... Goes nowhere.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:35: I have the ability to skillfully fold the universe at the level of energy, emotion, and thought, and mostly what I do with it is construct mobius loops of pendulum-swings so that I can feel like I'm always moving forward while I loop around the same places over and over.

2022-06-12 at 02:07:09: So yeah I hadn't really crystallized the fact that the center of that 5D labyrinth is a place where everything in the Xian cosmos comes together, and that we (God and each Xian/etc) are leaving each other gifts and messages at this Meet-up Point, the center of centers. Now I have

2022-06-12 at 02:07:09: It's like a Little Free Library for spiritual energy.

(Except way more gatekept in practice. So far at least.)

2022-06-12 at 02:07:08: And I can burn away what needs burning, and God can recycle the smoke. And I can take grace lovingly offered by every person/being linked in so many ways all to this same hyper-event.

2022-06-12 at 02:07:08: So at Mass, I bring what I am, offer it to God and to anyone else who can find grace in it, and to every version of myself past and future, and my ancestors and descendants and my neighbors and my nemeses and oppressors, and everyone everywhere everywhen who wants to access it.

2022-06-12 at 02:07:08: And the oil from this jar never empties (1 Kg 17), the grace from this 'cache' is never used up, and it can fill every vessel brought to the poor widow and still be abundant (2 Kg 4). Because God is bringing God's oil (grace) too, so there's way more going in the cache then out.

2022-06-12 at 02:07:07: We encounter every version of ourselves every time we've been at Mass (¬øand otherwise united with the Divine?), and all the different versions of everyone else at each Mass, everywhere. We bring what we have, and we add it to the Communion of the Saints, and we take what we need,

2022-06-12 at 02:07:07: All of these places-times-people are all linked together, woven together as we navigate the 5D-labyrinth-ritual of the Mass. And then, when we get to the center, we encounter-devour-submit-become the Lord.

*And we find a geocache of grace.* From every Mass and every Xian ever.

2022-06-12 at 02:07:07: But so let's get to reason I started on this thread, besides just loving to blather about all the spiritual shit that makes me feel deep or whatever.

2022-06-12 at 02:07:07: Jesus on the cross, and Jesus after the Resurrection -- and also bread and wine, though maybe God consumes that part. And also this Eucharist is Jesus the other-Christ in each person at Mass: our lives, our souls offered on the altar next to Christ's.

2022-06-12 at 02:07:06: The altar is the wood of the cross, the table of the Last Supper, and the stone beside the empty tomb. The bread and wine are Whatever Christ Did At The Last Supper (it's complicated and not 100% clear and, surprise, tinged with antisemitic historiography),

2022-06-12 at 02:07:06: So there's Christ in the celebrant(s) -- and in all the congregants, but Xianity is big on mediation in parallel with direct access (have been wedged against each other obv). And Christ in heaven offering Mass. And Christ c. 33CE in Judea during the Triduum.

All of these, linked

2022-06-12 at 02:07:06: The celebrant(s) is channeling that other-Christ-ness to fill a ritual role; I'd argue that anyone could do it, but inclination and proficiency should play a role in deciding how a group would want to celebrate, how many (con-)celebrants and whom, what variations/house-rules, etc

2022-06-12 at 02:07:06: All Xians are priests, though historically the churches have made a fuss about monopolizing that magic and associating it with a bunch of unnecessary, usually harmful power dynamics (clerics, presbyters, preachers, etc). We are each and all an 'alter Christus', an other-Christ.

2022-06-12 at 02:07:05: The idea is that every time Mass is offered on earth, it is also being offered by Jesus-as-High-Priest on the altar in front of the Lord seated on the Cherubim-throne in heaven -- or more technically, each Mass is linked to that one heavenly Mass &amp;/which is linked to the Triduum.

2022-06-12 at 02:07:05: (Antisemitism and supercessionist theology have been baked into Xianity basically from the start. This ritual appears to have developed in part because early Xians were no longer able to access Temple worship. A complicated history worth noting -- worth its own thread really.)

2022-06-12 at 02:07:04: So the Mass is a re-presentation of each of those three moments individually, and of the collective multi-day story-event that connects and surrounds them, and of Jesus himself as Incarnate God, as an offering loosely in the style of 2nd Temple altar-sacrifice-worship.

2022-06-12 at 02:07:04: 'The event' is the Triduum. It's defined by three moments in particular: when Jesus institutes the Eucharist on Holy Thursday, when he dies and descends to Hell on Good Friday, and when he rises embodied from the dead as the Vigil night turned to cock-crow o'clock Paschal Sunday.

2022-06-12 at 02:07:04: Each Mass is technically the same event being re-presented in separate place-times; there is a kind of link back to the place-times the event first happened.

2022-06-12 at 02:07:03: The metaphysics of the Mass are some of my favorite things to play with. I'm gonna share some about one of my hyperfixations: üßµ https://t.co/Ax01sxuFS5

2022-06-10 at 01:08:59: Partner didn't make that mess on her own, an old meta/roomie of hers definitely helped. But most of the mess did pre-date my coming around. This is the cleanest it's been since then, and the sudden absence of all that psychic pressure is. . . frustrating.

2022-06-10 at 01:08:59: I grew up in a house where my room was clean and the rest of the house was dirty. I had decades of experience ignoring all of the mess I don't tolerate in my own space. But of course that's meant that this apartment hasn't felt like my space, because it's been so messy.

2022-06-02 at 15:49:21: @taalumot I think it's easy for an ex-C*tholic to think the ch*rch was influential on the US, that is the propaganda we were fed. Still. Too much to go into replies but I feel like RCC gets ignored in places it deserves much blame; in US, the cat-prot divide was oft more veil than wall.

2022-06-02 at 15:36:58: @taalumot RCC-in-US just generally not given enough blame, imo, for what is often blamed solely on p*rit*nism+ev*ngel*calism inUS.

2022-06-01 at 15:23:40: That's actually maybe the hardest for me to intuitively internalize: The mistakes that come from loving myself too much, while real, hurt *everyone* *way* less than the mistakes I make from self-doubt/self-loathing/self-sabotage. Latter just easier for me to ignore my agency.

2022-06-01 at 15:23:40: I used to actually genuinely love myself, and I got scared out of it because that energy pushed me away from so much that was comfortable. But now I know how much I needed that push. Could have trusted myself. Could again. Should again, actually, best for everyone.

2022-06-01 at 15:23:39: Feeling a need to worry that I'm repressing my flaws to hide them *is part of the repression strategy.* Distract myself looking for what's in plain sight so I can stop looking at it for a while. Might even be true s/t but even then actually focusing on it doesn't usually rly help

2022-06-01 at 15:23:39: Ok actually, my 'biggest problem' is that I've come to largely identify myself as a list of things waiting to grow and problems blocking that growth. I'm actually p cool as-is, nor are my flaws that exceptional. I belong already. I don't have to earn that.

2022-06-01 at 14:33:29: I'm getting a lot more confidence that I'll get to where I'll be able to resolve these heretofore intractable patterns into something better, but rn it feels like backburnering then while learning about upstream problems is the move.

This may be a distraction? Lesson if so.

2022-06-01 at 14:33:29: I prolly wouldn't have even let myself try it for just one day until more recently. "Perfection or bust!"-- especially if "or bust" prolly means I can self-pity and change nothing!

8) No matter how Other reacts, I will likely have a TON of catharsis to harvest.

2022-05-28 at 15:37:22: 5) When it's Thing-time, wait on Other's convenience no matter how interruptible Other's day is. Then reference it obliquely to see if they pick up on it.
6) Then &amp; only then do I move in for the moneyshot: "Calling them out" (privately! ... usually) for being "so inconsiderate."

2022-05-28 at 15:37:22: 3) Find reason (the closer to 'real' while still just being an excuse, the better) I can't do/have Thing without Other.
4) Most important: DO NOT EXPLICITLY PLAN ANYTHING. The more sparse and oblique my communication, w/out being completely absent, the better.

2022-05-28 at 15:37:22: 1) Me and Other waiting for Thing
2) Mention to Other that Thing is v important to me, waiting eagerly, but while also broadcasting "my wants are safe to ignore" vibes. The more universal the want/need for Thing is, the better--  can set up bigger feelings of being aggrieved.

2022-05-09 at 23:46:42: So much of it came from adults around us either being cut off from these things as well or being impatient or trying to simplify instead of slowly explaining a more complex reality.

2022-04-29 at 18:33:39: Also all that said this positive subtweeting game is delightful, fascinating how much love and attention goes unseen and/or uncommunicated. I would like to practice sending vague general love vibes into the world so if you want a subtweet from me this is where you sign up.

2022-04-29 at 18:29:29: But fwiw I do tend toward not subtweeting, so if you do see me doing it, you can be very confident it's not about you, because I've put a lot of thought into it and don't want my s/t's to ever be seen by the referent/s, I want to vent until I can figure out how to communicate.

2022-04-29 at 18:29:28: On the other hand, I shouldn't have let that kind of energy around me -- not because it's necessarily bad or w/e -- can obviously be harmful -- but for me it's just that I don't metabolize that energy well, I don't like the way it vibes with my funky flow. My bad boundaries

2022-04-29 at 18:29:28: confront or communicate with me. That's the specific phenomenon I worry about, because it's happened to me. On the one hand it would've helped me to be approachable in conflicts, and honestly I've failed miserably at this over the years and told myself I was great at it.

2022-04-29 at 18:29:28: &amp; not just, like, people talking about me &amp; maybe critiquing, that seems normal to me, but talking others in a way that lets you eavesdrop (lit or metaphorically) and catch the emotional load of oblique passive aggressive smoldering resentment toward me without having to directly

2022-04-29 at 03:43:20: @0bviouSquirre1 Is arbitrary but they don't want to question the underlying framework because that same framework is baked into their own practices.

2022-04-29 at 03:41:44: @0bviouSquirre1 I think a lot of this among spiritual people is that there is a *fuck* ton of binary bioessentialism in these spiritual traditions, and nowhere near queer, non-binary engagements with them.

So people will try to compromise by conceding that what goes into each box

2022-04-28 at 15:12:56: It's tricky because it's such a complicated, personal, and still-being-unfolded realm, so we can't even decide on, let alone collectively point to, every idea that is just social conditioning. We can disagree about gender! But not without limit. I mean we can but I'm not playing.

2022-04-28 at 15:12:56: Come back and do that and we still probably won't agree on everything but we'll now be able to actually navigate safely together. As it stands you're just going to silently gut the hearts of the trans people around you if you don't work to destroy gender brainwashing.

2022-04-28 at 15:12:56: You actually have to go into your brain and find the way you think about gender and bodies and biosex and sex -- don't do it for the queers, do it for you! You're leaving so much reality on the table to settle for an aesthetically pleasing, false, flattening projection.

2022-04-28 at 15:12:56: We don't have to have the exact same epistemology on this but let's be clear: if you're basically just a tolerant terf, you are *more* dangerous to us than loud terfs.

2022-04-20 at 15:30:53: Designed to let me off the hook for actually resolving the problems with the A-B system by pretending that B was both separate from and a higher priority than A. And I mean I've run into similar before, in me and others, so I knew this happened, but it feels much more naked now.

2022-04-20 at 15:30:53: It might not be obvious -- and given the directionless nature of it all it can pretend to work the other way around -- but once I see that whatever's happening at point A is flowing down to mess with point B, I realize that my workflow prioritization was, intentionally or not,

2022-04-20 at 15:30:52: The stream at point A doesn't seem nearly as choked off or disturbed or w/e as it did at B, though, and fixing point A seems like it will be a pain in the butt, so I file it in my head for later, under "After you resolve point B." You see it, right?

2022-04-20 at 15:30:52: Let's say there is an energy flow in my field that we could visualize like a river. I notice a problem at point B --  I spend a lot of time trying to correct the flow, but nothing happens. I continue along. Further upstream, I notice another irregularity at point A, but

2022-04-20 at 15:30:52: "Do I want to change this, and do I know how to do that safely yet?" and if so, try that. And if I don't, I can file it away for later and move on. This is a big deal period, but for certain problems it is a game changer. Bc my problems had a strategy: divide and distract!

2022-04-20 at 15:30:51: At some point I had lost the ability to notice something I wanted to change in myself without either justifying it or tearing myself down immediately. Neither of which really lead to growth. Lately I can stare at something, let it sting a bit, but then ask myself,

2022-04-20 at 01:26:08: I just ended a pointless war. And kind of literally told the survivors to go wage love instead. I hope that will be much better for everyone involved.

2022-04-20 at 00:40:06: I wish this had been obvious to me, but having something I find enjoyable to do that is made more difficult when I'm not well-rested and sober has made me prioritize sleep and sobriety more. I think there is an even broader lesson about approaches in there

2022-04-19 at 20:04:37: So why are you surprised someone else reached the exact same conclusion me, MF, and G came to like half a decade ago? Because collectively, we had just enough individuals who were in it for the work to pretend we weren't in it for the prestige and the image/ideal.

2022-04-19 at 20:04:37: I laid all this out very clearly five years ago, we gave the house away two years ago. The building was always the biggest *obstacle* to the work. If we had downsized to a smaller building we could still be doing something, instead of just waxing nostalgia about the good ol days.

2022-04-19 at 20:04:36: Of the building or of the people or of the community, and it all fell apart. And so yeah the next non-profit to see how little we invested in upkeep realized the building is a bottomless sinkhole of money. It could have been saved by a real budget, not by another non -prof.

2022-04-19 at 20:04:36: Yeah that building ran off of donations because we were screwing over the people we were ostensibly serving *and* all but the oldest white ladies of the people who form the org's "community." Exploiting everyone so we could keep saying this thing exists. We didn't take care,

2022-04-19 at 20:04:36: When no one wants to admit the founders' intentions might not have been pure and that maybe there was collective delusion about the impact of your org for generations because everyone wants to feel helpful more than they want to help. # Just CWer Things

2022-04-16 at 22:58:42: So I'm pretty sure that self-love and self-confidence is better for me, for anyone around me, for the world. It certainly feels better and lets me get more out of life. So, I give myself permission to trust myself again. Nobody's perfect, but I'm p great. I can act like it.

2022-04-16 at 22:58:42: But if I could convince myself that I wasn't capable of anything even close to my limits, I could try avoiding the pain of running into those limits. I found plenty of other pain tho. And my limits constricted because I was never pushing against them, so I found that pain anyway!

2022-04-16 at 22:58:41: For me it's that the last time I felt that kind of deep love and trust in myself to be able to explore my limits, I found them, and I handled it poorly. But self-confidence wasn't the antagonist of that story-- it's what could have given me the strength to face my mistakes.

2022-03-29 at 18:55:17: It's all stuff that you can do more clunkily in a text document or three, it'd be a matter of streamlining, so that you can build the ritual from pieces and have it all in one place, in order, rather than having it scattered as within missals and between missals and lectionaries.

2022-03-29 at 18:55:16: Being able to load in pre -created modules -- including repositories of propers, eg. a lectionary module with readings for every [day/week/whatever]. Open collaboration even, living -document style, could be useful for communities making new rituals.

2022-03-29 at 18:55:16: It would make it easier to analyze liturgy, easier to make new liturgy, easier to iterate on existing liturgy. Make it a general enough toolset and it could be used for any ritual. Doesn't seem too hard to code even, though it's beyond me currently I think.

2022-03-29 at 18:55:16: Remembered an old idea that I'd still love to execute. I was thinking about how modular Roman liturgy is/could be, and it occurred to me how handy it would be if you could add your own templates, link your own modules, set up option-branches for variations.

2022-03-21 at 14:24:11: Nature is everywhere and humans are a part of it, second-growth forests still have their power. But white empire's impact on the ecosystem is so large we hardly left a single tree untouched in this beautiful countryside.

2022-01-16 at 09:54:24: It's clearly A Thing for me. It's a theme that touches on so many other themes -- both in narrative and in my life and in anyone's life. It's versatile: so easy to go from romanticized to horror and back, so many metaphors to play with.  And I just find it dangerously fascinating

2022-01-16 at 09:54:23: Oh shit even Evangelion kinda has gestalt themes (more of a stretch, also spoilers so I won't go into it). Mind of my Mind/Patternmaster is p classic hive mind. For me, 1 takeaway from Electric Castle is that each of us can play any of the 8 characters, we can all play any role.

2022-01-16 at 09:54:23: And that made me realize I've only seen the first few episodes of Sense8, which is an 8-mind-8-body hive mind situation. And Idk it made me wanna write this all down because it's hilarious to me how many configurations there are for these themes.

2022-01-16 at 09:54:23: And then re-reading Spin State made me realize that if I'm gonna let this be a thing I not just read/watch all the time but also write about all the time, I should eventually do a 2-mind-2-body melding story.

2022-01-16 at 09:54:23: Or I could lean harder into it than I was even planning and also write about Christianity's favorite gestalt entity, the Trinity. I'd be kinda shocked if I don't eventually do this, I can easily think of a few different conceptualizations/stories that would be fun to explore.

2022-01-16 at 09:54:22: That's a challenge, but it's one I think I could rise to. What's harder are the religious themes I was going with in that one -- it's labeled "Genesis Story"-- I could definitely envision myself taking the gestalt configuration from that and spinning a different story around it.

2022-01-16 at 09:54:22: I have a story on the backburner that I'm just not good enough to write yet. It's a 1-mind-many-body situation -- not exactly a hive mind as I tend to think of it, just one individual awareness which has multiple bodies (3 individuals each with their own sets of bodies actually).

2022-01-16 at 09:54:22: The story waiting for me when that's done has an AI hitching a ride on a human character's cybernetic arm, so 2-mind-shared-body, but not fusion -- they will develop a very intimate connection but their personalities won't blur I don't think. Not a central theme but still there.

2022-01-16 at 09:54:22: I'm currently writing a story largely revolving around 2-mind-1-body fusion, I might try 3- or 4-mind-1-body if I think I can write it well (decent odds I think but def a bigger challenge).

2022-01-16 at 09:54:21: It's kinda wild I haven't watched all of Sense8. I've been doing some reading/media with themes of gestalt entities as support for my own work, and that's a glaring hole in my knowledge. I would love recommendations for anything involving gestalts, hive minds, fusions, etc.

Hate, despair, selfishness.
How could I ever act this way to those
I love?"

The raindrop, dripping on the lawn.
The deer, running far away.
The wind, that makes the wild sway.
The cool air, that nurtures the trees.
'Thanks for talking, just you and me.'"

2022-01-04 at 03:27:25: "Leaves fly in the wind.
No pattern, no purpose. Free
It follows one path.
The one /it/ chose. The free path.
Infinite options."

They know a spreading virus does this. Part of why they want it to spread! That and the literal death, the demonic cult.

2021-12-28 at 18:11:23: It's actually creating new iterations of the class divide, it's incentivizing us to be more insular and less welcoming. And the solution isn't to not care about covid, but it's worth paying attention to these consequences.

2021-12-28 at 18:11:22: Especially since the way this works in practice often looks like, eg, having a bunch of friends over for an indoor unmasked hangout but refusing to open the door and actually have a face-to-face interaction with the person who delivers y'all a bunch of food.

2021-12-28 at 18:11:22: One of the most troubling effects of the pandemic, especially at this stage, is how it furthers the divide between us and strangers. That distance helps stop spread, it's necessary. But it literally creates more distance between us and anyone not in our family/crew/pod. Un-ideal.

2021-12-23 at 18:56:22: But it's nothing-and-no-one's "fault." I'm just moving forward. Into community that can hold me the way I am. Into ways of being with people that honor my boundaries and needs, ways that are sustainable. And out of this fucking ranty thread omg üòÖ

2021-12-23 at 18:56:21: I'm still responsible for how I've handled that, but it's nice to be able to see it, name it, and even start to describe it after a literal lifetime of opaqueness around it. Idk where I got all these harmful ideas. Church? TV? Family? Friends? Just me? All of the above I'm sure

2021-12-23 at 18:56:20: As long as I understood the social contract the way I did, and thought I should mask as well as I could to "do well" at society, that I should tweak every thought and feeling and action because that's what I thought was expected of me -- of everyone -- I was set up to fail.

2021-12-23 at 18:56:20: Still, I'm coming up with the new game-plan, because that was never gonna work. I'm surprised it held up as long as it did. 

Friendships are important. Still, I have *long* said I am a pretty bad friend, and I see now that was a self-fulfilling prophecy.

2021-12-23 at 18:56:19: And I am probably an introvert, really. I do need time to focus on what I want to, without thinking about someone else's thoughts, and I have yet to find out how to stop thinking about the thoughts of anyone in the vicinity.

2021-12-23 at 18:56:18: Maybe that's an exhausting way to live. Maybe you mix that with a bunch of sensory processing issues that you just brute-force your way through and don't even ever analyze, sprinkle in some dysphoria, and you've turned every other human being into an obstacle-- a threat even.

2021-12-23 at 18:56:17: ‚ùóÔ∏èAm I really an introvert, or is it just exhausting to believe that I have to control my emotions and present them in as warm and loving a manner as possible, to as many people as possible, while still somehow being authentic and honest, to consider myself a good person?‚ùóÔ∏è

2021-12-23 at 18:56:16: . . . or did I just rush to make myself friendly with as many people as I thought I could possibly handle because "good people have lots of friends and bad people have no friends, right"? . . . or did I believe that a friendship is inherently a "better" kind of relationship?

2021-12-23 at 18:56:15: Am I really an introvert, or did I just present myself as a source of energy and encourage everyone I met to just drain from me in order to make me feel like a good, special person with power (to help, in theory)?

2021-12-23 at 18:56:14: Am I really an introvert or am I just autistic in an allistic society?

2021-12-20 at 08:07:44: We need every witch, every priest, every shaman, every healer, every worker, every dreamer we can get. I don't like to think in oppositional terms, but there is actual Evil in the world, and I think Spirit is required to respond to it. So I want communities of practice.

2021-12-20 at 08:07:44: And I'm also interested in establishing structures where people can experiment, especially if it's not usually their realm. Because the harvest is great and the laborers few, and there isn't a person who can't touch Spirit. We *are* Spirit. And the sacred is really just life.

2021-12-20 at 08:07:44: And no mainline church is gonna give me anything close to what I want. I want to be in community with people who go deep into Spirit. And people who are gonna try and put their faith into practice to serve their fellow humans instead of just feeling good for being in a club.

And I can't help but wonder
If I was ever a good friend to you.
Have I ever returned the favor? Will I ever get a chance to?
You told me to move on, live my life.
I have.
But Dreamer, I'm missing you, Marie.

2021-12-18 at 08:33:54: In the moments in my life when I would lose myself,
I'd try to find you instead.
Your face isn't as sharp in my memory as I want,
But I will never forget when you appeared.
Dreamer, you probably aren't anywhere,
But I wish you were here.

2021-12-18 at 08:33:54: I think we owe each other love and company,
Patience and gratitude.
I think we owe each other an explanation.
And I think we owe it to ourselves to reunite and relax into deep, calm love for each other and ourselves.

Dreamer, what have we been doing?
What is left to be done?

2021-12-18 at 08:33:54: Dreamer, you've moved me,
But you've also left me stuck at times,
Waiting. It's not your fault,
But I could use your help. Find me,
Or help me find you.
I think you have answers I've wanted my whole life,
And exactly the questions I've been looking for.

2021-12-18 at 08:33:54: Hey dreamer.
I know you're out there.
It's been almost ten years, and I'm still looking for you, wondering when we'll meet again.
I want to remember, to celebrate. 
I want to understand who we are
And what we could become.

2021-11-23 at 16:32:14: Same with a lot of physical stuff honestly. I'm pretty fit, p strong. Also my joints are fucky and I deal with chronic pain where flare-ups can be somewhat disabling. It's turbulent.

2021-11-23 at 16:32:13: Whether I am actually autistic or not, one thing this year of my life has taught me is that "high vs low functioning" is a completely false binary. There are days when I can't do anything. Some, everything. But many days it's both.

2021-10-11 at 14:55:37: PS: I know there is a tension here, another side to the coin that is equally true -- that is, in fact, the same thing. But I don't see a ton of awareness of this side, nor reflection on how to turn this polarity into a unified spectrum.

2021-10-11 at 14:49:26: You meant to give hope, perspective, advice. Instead you're giving a feeling of being measured and found wanting. A feeling of "even though I'm doing so much and working so hard, I'm not doing enough, I'm not doing all I should be."

My advice? Avoid giving unsolicited advice.

2021-10-11 at 14:49:25: It just gives "pull yourself *and* your community up by the bootstraps" vibes for me. I know it's meant in good faith but people know their conditions could be improved, they often know how. But if they don't have the capacity and resources to do it, they can't.

2021-10-11 at 14:49:25: Like, YES, individuals do have power to unite and effect change, and YES people closest to the problem should be in leadership. But I always just see the added burden of "hey I know you can't get your basic needs met, here's another massive project I'm saying you should do!"

2021-10-11 at 14:49:25: Examples: "You're unhoused and in a financially precarious situation, and you're stressed about the cost of produce in your area? You should start a grower's collective!" "Your job sucks? You should organize a union!" "University's denying you accommodations? Awareness campaign!"

2021-10-11 at 14:49:24: When people offer unsolicited advice to struggling individuals that they should take on the onus of creating systemic solutions to their problems, it  still rings like hyper-individualism.

2021-03-22 at 02:16:48: But I also thank Godde for the anger. For the knowledge that everyone, that my body and I, deserve better than this capitalist hellscape. May I honor that anger by fighting for a better world for everyone.

2021-03-22 at 02:16:48: If I want to center in gratitude instead of anger, I'll choose gratitude for my body, for doing its best to support me with insufficient resources. Soon its blood supply will replenish, my metabolism will return to normal, and estrogen will flow through me again. Thank Godde.

2021-03-22 at 02:16:48: Of how privilege pushes me toward gratitude for the crumbs from billionaire's tables instead of righteous anger at my own plight *and* the plight of everyone suffering under our ableist, oppressive healthcare system... It's just so much. So heavy.

2021-03-22 at 02:16:47: I shouldn't have had to go through all this. No one should. Everyone deserves access to healthcare, everyone deserves treatment and healing. The arbitrariness of it all, the abusive dynamics of this country's medical system, the divide-and-conquer-esque nature

2021-03-22 at 02:16:47: And I also feel guilty for not feeling grateful, because I know in many ways I'm privileged to have been able to even get to this place. But that's fucked up! Survivor's guilt shouldn't be a factor here, I shouldn't have to consider myself "lucky" I should be able to just be mad!

2021-03-22 at 02:16:47: All could've been explained and treated so easily, but because of the horrible system for healthcare we have in this country, even in my full-time union job I had to wait a full year and just carry on, grit my teeth and get through. It's a lot to process. I'm so mad.

2021-03-22 at 02:16:47: And I'm just mad at how I've been made to "earn" the right to see a doctor and discover the extent of this problem before I could get it fixed, literally without enough blood to even keep my circulation proper. So much of my binging behavior, my fatigue and muscle weakness,

2021-03-22 at 02:16:46: After getting my lab results back, it turns out that my hypothyroidism had gotten so bad that not only had my metabolism plummeted even further than I'd imagined, my liver has been diverting so much iron into making the hormone that would stimulate a not-essentially-dead

2021-03-22 at 02:16:46: It's a lot to process that I've been pushing through this pandemic not only without hrt, and thus dealing with hormonal detransition knowing I'd have to start retransition on the other side, but also with untreated hypothyroidism. And that's what I knew about already!

2020-12-08 at 14:52:53: I'm so grateful to all the exposure to ADHD and related struggles I've had over this year, because I think they cover like 80-90% of what I've meant over the years anytime I've said "I don't think people understand just how 'busted' my brain is." *I* didn't understand my brain!

2020-12-08 at 14:52:53: And just in general I have to do all these things that don't make sense to outside observers just to get by in the world. On top of which shame and internalized ableism coerce me into masking the full extent of the accommodations I have to give myself, which further strains me.

2020-12-08 at 14:52:52: The raw amount of input -- sensory, intellectual, emotional (internally, interpersonally, and in terms of ambient empathy) -- plays a huge role in how my brain functions, and my brain just doesn't seem to adapt as well to shifts. I run into weird bottlenecks.

It is not about having the perfect solution today and making sure everyone knows you've got your shit figured out already. None of us do. Let's all get to work on it, and give each other space for it.

2020-10-20 at 21:27:27: And while yes a lot of this has to do with election day, I think it's only gonna get worse over the next several months if we don't realize that it's about way more than election day: it's about fear, it's about pain, it's about love the world we need to build to protect

2020-10-20 at 21:27:26: supplant the more important mission: creating a world in which we can all thrive. It's not a matter of either/or. It's a matter of focus. Less passing accountability, more taking it. Less division, more movement. Less defense, more offense.

2020-10-20 at 21:27:26: and fighting the systems that put so much goddamn chaff in our fields in the first place. Notice that nowhere in there do I say we work with chaff! But wheat and chaff is a false binary anyway. We can acknowledge that chaff exists and burn it where we can without letting that

2020-10-20 at 21:27:25: Because until we do that, until we stop thinking that we can separate the wheat from the chaff before Judgment Day, that's exactly what we're gonna waste our time trying to do, instead of working to build systems that help the wheat thrive,

2020-10-20 at 21:27:24: So it can't just be 'you and maybe that one other person you can stand,' or 'you and your chosen family,' or 'you and your friends.' We're *all,* *ALL* gonna have to admit that "ALL have sinned and fallen short of the glory of Godde."

2020-10-20 at 21:27:22: This will involve a lot of individual and collective work, but the collective nature should never be lost. And guess what! The collective has to be a *mass movement,* a huge redistribution, otherwise none of it will matter long term.

2020-10-20 at 21:27:19: If we want to survive, we've got to acknowledge that we're broken, and go on the uncomfortable, never-certain quest of healing. Healing not just ourselves, but our whole world. We need to really shift and distribute power, on a truly massive scale.

2020-10-20 at 21:27:16: Trying to keep focused on bigger pictures, on what actually matters. So many people are acting like they're in fear of Judgment Day, like they need to be pure, unassailable, and comfortable in where they stand in order to survive. Those are exactly the wrong goals!

2020-10-03 at 01:29:21: I have *no* medical safety net. I have no insurance and not-great credit. I also live in v cramped quarters with two others, making it hard to self-isolate if I do get sick. I'm trying to get us all through this. I have a whole-ass life I'm trying to live.

2020-10-03 at 01:29:20: It feels so gaslighty. Like, y'all, I'm really, really trying to not die of coronavirus. I don't understand why it's hard for you to understand. You're so gleeful at the idea that Trump's crack medical team will fail to keep him alive. I don't get a crack medical team.

2020-10-03 at 01:29:19: All the people of color and trans people I know are locked up p tight, but every cis/white person with health insurance is basically living a normal-ass life but without bars and restaurants (which aren't normal for many people either). It's exhausting.

2020-09-06 at 12:16:06: @alexegesis So I think what happens a lot on tradcath thought is that postmodernism is painted at being a problem for a more central tenet, like the resurrection, to make it more scary to laity than discussing its implications on ecclesiastical power, where real danger lies.

2020-09-06 at 12:13:02: @alexegesis Postmodernism, imo, still allows for a literal resurrection in tradcath theo, but would deeply affect its moral theology, esp the hierarchical process of Biblical interpretation enmeshed with and reinforcing their institutional structures.

2020-08-02 at 22:35:05: I'm not saying that "some people don't want help." I'm saying that we need to actually *ask* want kind of help people want and *listen* to them rather than forcing a way of life on them that they might not want, yet or ever.

2020-08-02 at 22:33:36: And that as long as our attitude towards people who want to remain unhoused stays the same, many other unhoused people won't trust us because weve already demonstrated that we care less about their wants and needs and more about making them fit our conceptions of 'normal' society

2020-08-02 at 22:33:36: What I'm saying is that if our solutions for how we support the unhoused only involve giving houses to the people who want housing, we're still going to have a big population of people for whom we need to build structures of support so that they can *stay* unhoused if they want.

2020-08-02 at 22:33:35: When I try and talk about this, people act like I couldn't be right. OR, they think I'm saying that unhoused people don't have houses because they just don't want it enough. That's not what I'm saying at all!

2020-08-02 at 22:33:35: I don't think we're ever, *ever* going to "solve" the unhoused crisis if we don't really accept, respect, and internalize the reality that there truly are a lot of people living out in the world who *do not want a house*.

2020-07-12 at 03:40:41: Which I mean sounds like the ultimate heretic thing to say lmao, but also, I don't think most pagans would consider me nearly pagan enough. So. . . once again, I find myself nestled in an uncomfortable middle ground. Wow this thread got long. Processed some good stuff. Um. Bai.

2020-07-12 at 03:40:41: I see a vague idea not fully developed. And when I listen to pagans (and, also, organizers -- especially pagan organizers) talk about spirituality, I feel that gap start to fill. Working with Magic feels like working with the Holy Spirit.

2020-07-12 at 03:40:41: But I am Christian! I might be open to a wider array of spiritual beings and influences, but at the end of the day I love the Lady our Godde, and Jesus Christ Her Son. It's just that, when I think about the Holy Spirit, all I see at this point in my spiritual life is a hole.

2020-07-12 at 03:40:40: It feels very disconnected from its spiritual roots at this point. I don't buy into the Western Imperial Catholic Church anymore! So much of my pantheon is this world of saints who operated within a structure and a mindset that I largely reject.

2020-07-12 at 03:40:40: And even though the overwhelming majority of my liturgical action is Christian in nature -- mostly private Masses (usually Latin Low Mass unless there's something on the modern calendar I want to celebrate), a very very abridged version of the Hours -- it honestly feels. . . hm..

2020-07-12 at 03:40:40: Sometimes I will work pagan rituals -- charge a sigil, gather some herbs, calling back energy, etc. I have two Tarot decks that I adore, and my consultations wax and wane but they've seen a lot of use over the years. I also practice yoga, which is its own thread maybe somed

2020-07-12 at 03:40:40: I, like many pagans, have an altar set up in my room, with the usual chalice and candles. Unlike most Christians, I also have four objects I have chosen to represent the four elements, and a broom standing at the ready for when I want to work serious magic.

2020-07-12 at 03:40:40: Christianity has its own magic. Coming from the Catholic tradition, and having delved into the old Latin rites pretty damn deeply (like idk I'd consider myself an amateur expert), I have learned a lot of liturgical knowledge that looks a lot like pagan worship.

2020-07-12 at 03:40:40: I often feel very split between Christian and witch. I find it hard to describe how they intersect in my belief system. I'd say I'm mostly Christian. But in many ways I'm more pagan. Certainly I've rebelled some from Western ideals of the platonic GOD. My Godde is more human.

2020-07-08 at 23:00:38: Anyway, yeah. Parents are hard but this family already has enough unresolved generational trauma (more than I really know anything about, I'm dimly aware), I'd like to at least try and break that chain.

2020-07-08 at 23:00:38: And I need to be able to trust myself enough to name, honor, and hold space for all that resentment rage and sadness without losing sight of our love for each other. That's gonna take some work too, cause I can definitely switch on a bitch *fast* (almost like a trauma response!).

2020-07-08 at 23:00:37: Idk, I just, I love them so deeply but if I don't start healing the resentment will never ever let go of me. The first step is rebuilding a relationship with them. The second step is probably the kind of emotional talk that my whole extended family can have trouble with.

2020-07-08 at 23:00:37: I'm also furious at how they play favorites and how I've been calling them out on it for like 20 years. It fucked up me and my sister, and our relationship, so bad. (And then I took a bat to it that one time. Did plenty to contribute myself.)

2020-07-08 at 23:00:37: To say nothing of how none of us knew I was trans or what my mental health diagnostics looked like. I think my parents might find me having ADHD implausible, even though it's fucking obvious. But the studious manageable beloved first "son" couldn't have a "learning disorder"!

2020-07-08 at 23:00:36: When you've been gaslit and emotionally manipulated as a regular feature of your childhood by your own parents who do clearly love you... It might take you 28 years to finally be willing to name the behavior, even, that's how confusing it is.

2020-05-10 at 23:53:46: But obviously I have a deep love for mothers and motherhood (üòÖ). I'm so grateful to all the people who've mothered me in my life, from my blood mother to any person who would accept the title. It's part of why I love that picture on my wall. I miss those mothers very much.

2020-05-10 at 23:53:44: Some people need to use this day to grieve mothers. Some might need to process trauma. Some might need to repudiate the idea of a gendered concept of parenthood in the first place (again the gender discourse is a WHOLE thread). I don't wanna proselytize a hallmark holiday.

2020-05-10 at 23:53:43: But it also calls us to expand our idea of what we see as mothering, to find value and appreciation for those who have mothered in ways that aren't traditionally recognized, all while still holding space for those for who just do not want to celebrate motherhood.

2020-05-10 at 23:53:43: Happy Mother's Day y'all. It's a weird holiday. So many mothers are god damned awful. So many women have been abused by and through and in the concept of motherhood. (Mother's Day is also a quagmire and a half for nonbinary (and binary trans even) people. Could be a whole thread)

2020-05-10 at 23:53:42: All these Comeau women, all of them mothers (well not yet for me but y'know) in different phases of life. All the generational stuff, good and bad and complicated. (Being a trans baby how my relationship to that picture's femme-ness changed as I grew up.) A lot there. Anyway,

2020-05-10 at 23:53:42: It's Mother's Day, right? And I have this picture that hangs on the wall by my desk. It has me (baby), my aunt (17?), my mom (30-something), my grandma (RIP), and my great-grandma (nearing the end of her life) all in one shot.

2020-05-10 at 23:53:41: I wanted to share a picture on Facebook earlier  but I wasn't sure that everyone in my family would want to see it today. My grandmother passed two years ago and I think we'll all be processing the grief in slow mostly-private drips for years tbh. A lot there. Anyway,

2020-02-13 at 08:34:25: This all could've gone so many different ways. There were so many different *good* ways for it to go. But I had hoped one day to be pretty much where we are now, and I look forward to seeing where we go.

I love you so much üíúüíúüíú

2020-02-13 at 08:34:25: I won't know that our romance has gone from cocoon to butterfly until after it's happened. I don't know how long it will take. But I feel like there's a mostly-formed butterfly in our chrysalis right now, wings almost ready ü¶ã We'll take our time, and we'll fly together.

2020-02-13 at 08:34:24: It's really messy and hard to sort. Basically... Our friendship, though it's been strained, has been beautiful and strong and healthy throughout all of this, and I feel like our romance is starting to reflect that.

2020-02-13 at 08:34:24: It's just a lot of small interlocking and interdependent systems finally starting to come together in the ways we'd hoped to. We still have a ways to go, and of course no relationship is ever done growing, but I'm starting to feel like we're accomplishing what we started.

2020-02-13 at 08:34:24: We definitely did that work in the right order. Still, even though we're both very touch-centric (and sexual) people, I had honestly underestimated how much a more comfortable physical dynamic would further secure the emotional dynamics we've built and strengthened.

2020-02-13 at 08:34:23: And the shift feels really deep even though it's not that far. And I can feel how it is informed by, and helps to further strengthen, all the emotional and boundary work that we've done. They spiral together, and build on each other.

2020-02-13 at 08:34:23: We've been getting more stable again lately though. And we'd been talking about wanting more touch again. It finally started to happen this week. More kisses, some snuggling. We're both very touchy people, so while it wasn't necessary, it was something we both wanted.

2020-02-13 at 08:34:22: That aspect of our relationship had been mostly on hold the last two months. The occasional pat of affection, a kiss maybe but never on the lips. A decent start, but we had other work to do in our own individual lives, there just wasn't enough energy to focus on it.

2020-02-13 at 08:34:21: In November, we said that we wanted to add touch back into our relationship. Of course, there was a lot of the above eork to be done in this realm too. We also took this very slowly. It was related but separate work. And honestly less of a priority.

2020-02-13 at 08:34:20: This work continues, but I feel like the hardest most foundational aspects have been put in place, and I am so grateful for the beautiful growth we've accomplished. It made us better partners and better people.

2020-02-13 at 08:34:20: Be better to ourselves, each other, and be better partners. We were honest and loving and held ourselves and each other accountable without competition, neither fighting not capitulating but simply working together to find a new balance, a deeper posture, a healthier dynamic.

2020-02-13 at 08:34:20: The analysis of our relationship couldn't be summed up as "Me too much this" or "You not enough that," yet when we needed to talk about  these things we could trust it to come from a place of mutual hope. No one was trying to "win", we both wanted to help each other be better.

2020-02-13 at 08:34:20: That is maybe what I'm most proud of. We didn't try to blame one person or the other, we recognized how each of us had to work differently and how we needed to work differently together. We named problems unique to each of us without hesitation, but without trying to assign blame

2020-02-13 at 08:34:19: We checked in on values and wants and needs. We began the hard, hard work of unpacking and processing the reasons why our romance hadn't worked in the past and what we needed to do differently.

2020-02-13 at 08:34:19: First it just started off with a shift in emotions. Saying "I love you" more frequently, and with romantic intention. Very, very, very slowly and carefully renegotiating our boundaries to be more open without going back to the codependence of our first months together.

2020-02-13 at 08:34:19: That built up trust, and the growth we did in our own lives suggested we could do the growth we needed in the relationship. And so we decided to be really slow, really deliberate, and really patient, and to give it another go. This started in October I'd say.

2020-02-13 at 08:34:18: All of this messiness going on, and we're living together with a partner we both are in relationship with. Super messy. But we find a way to give each other the space we need to insulate from each other, to do some growing on our own. We were there for each other, but as friends.

2020-02-13 at 08:34:18: All this time there's also stuff going on in our separate lives that we need to grow through. Again, a lot of unique stuff, some overlap, and a few shared issues, but not in the context of "us" and the relationship, stuff we'd have to work on even if we'd parted ways.

2020-02-13 at 08:34:17: First, we stopped having sex, and didn't touch much. Then we stopped touching at all, and the romance was on hold. This is where we were last June. In our relationship, we both had unique issues, we had a lot of overlap, and we shared a few issues too.

2020-02-13 at 08:34:16: We are both so good to each other, but, we both have deep flaws and bad patterns. Some of our dynamics were harmful, so I told them they needed to grow, learn to be more considerate and take less from the relationship. (I did too.) Love was real, gratitude present, but harm done.

2020-02-13 at 08:34:16: Our romantic relationship started off really intense. Way too fucking intense, esp in hindsight. She told me it was overwhelming. I needed time to grow more independent, to learn better boundaries. (Her too.) I would've lost myself, there just wasn't really any balance.

2020-02-13 at 08:34:15: Honestly I could write a whole thread on what our friendship means to me, but I'm trying to process romance specifically. They blend quite a bit with us though. We just click. They make me smile so much, in both realms. And they're someone I respect so much.

2020-02-13 at 08:34:15: To start off with, he's been one of my best fucking friends since I met him. We share so many interests, values, passions, and we know how to share what's unique with each other too. We've been together 2 fucking years almost and we can still spend a whole night just talking.

2020-02-13 at 08:34:14: (Gay thread)

2019-11-27 at 17:05:36: @SentientSpinch I feel like I didn't lose anything that was essentially me. But the chemical change definitely tweaks with it.

This is basically a really long-winded way of me saying I'd be surprised if your hormones aren't playing a role.

2019-11-27 at 17:04:00: @SentientSpinch Like, there is recognisable continuity between my pre- and post-hormonal transition sexuality and physical intimacy preferences. But there are a lot of differences too. And I had to learn some new wants, recontextualize some wants, and say goodbye to a few things.

2019-11-27 at 17:01:32: @SentientSpinch That was gonna go away as soon as the chemicals shifted. (I don't know how that compares to going from E-fueled to T-fueled, though.) The other factor was just that the fundamental way these things worked in me was changing, and I suddenly had to adapt.

2019-11-27 at 16:58:40: @SentientSpinch So when I first was going through HRT, I experienced an initial drop in touch-hunger and libido that lasted a few months. I think this was for (at least) two different reasons. One is that I feel like for a moment both my T and E levels were low. (Cont'd)

2019-11-27 at 12:25:26: @passbyval Also 27, we're so freaking young it's not even funny xD I mean I feel ancient a lot so I'm not trying to act like I've moved past this. But I know it rationally.

2019-11-26 at 19:20:19: It should be a reminder of the evils of Western imperialism, as well as motivation to encourage and support change. One simple way this could manifest: support anime that accurately portrays POC!

2019-11-26 at 19:20:19: Japan is systemically complicit with anti-Black racism and is itself responsible for the harm it causes. But USAers need to understand that we have and continue to drastically influence how the Japanese view race -- even to the point of how they view and draw themselves.

2019-11-26 at 19:20:19: Japan has its own history of imperialism and colorism, yes. But the USA brought so much anti-Black racism and led to so much internalized racism that draws (sometimes literally) Western whiteness as the norm.

2019-11-26 at 19:20:18: Tangent on LRT:

White people need to do more reflection on the fact that the USA colonized Japan so profoundly, one visible result being that white or whitewashed characters are the norm in anime -- even for Japanese characters.
