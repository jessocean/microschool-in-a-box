2019-05-31 at 20:53:13: @strive4liberty Yup. And I'd also be curious to see the breakdown by gender. Are you more likely to name inanimate objects after your own gender or the opposite? (Personally my inanimate objects have all been female)

2019-05-31 at 20:47:48: @strive4liberty Yeah that's a better theory. That female-ness is preferred for assistants and thus artificial assistants. But an inanimate object that is not personified as an assistant (for example, a car) might still feel male

2019-05-31 at 20:40:19: Many of you have inanimate objects with male names. This surprised me...I thought that Alexa and Siri having female names might be a sign of a universal preference for female inanimate objects. https://t.co/Bx4urZ5qRA

2019-05-31 at 18:52:56: @vgr @fortelabs I can't tell if this is a joke. You are a prolific tweeter. And you use Twitter in an interesting way, either getting your followers to play word and concept games with you, or as an outlet for your grumpy old man persona. Perhaps I have a broad definition of 'inspiration'

2019-05-31 at 18:09:03: Inspiration is 'use it or lose it'.

Twitter lets you externalize the smallest stroke of inspiration, so you can refer to it or build off of it later

https://t.co/PylmAfRumW

2019-05-31 at 18:02:43: @fortelabs @vgr Part of Twitter's magic is that it lets you externalize the smallest stroke of inspiration, so you can refer to it or build off of it later

2019-05-31 at 17:30:53: @fortelabs @vgr this is a good summary of what i've learned from you. convert every stroke of inspiration into a tangible Thing. powerful stuff!

2019-05-31 at 17:25:32: @visakanv @nrose where do you keep your moodboard, Pinterest?

2019-05-31 at 16:59:18: @tasshinfogleman @visakanv ooh now I want to try too. I am brainstorming and it's difficult. Visa, your read on people and ability to translate it into visuals is really something!

2019-05-31 at 16:07:25: @webrender_ @visakanv Great theory, but I don't believe it. A more accurate telling is: The term Visa was conceived by the company's founder, Dee Hock. He believed that @visakanv was instantly recognizable by many tweeters in many countries, and that it also denoted universal love.

2019-05-31 at 15:03:46: When Visa is a promoted post on your timeline and you are confused but it turns out there is a BRAND named Visa that may or may not be named after @visakanv (probably yes? does anyone know the history here??) https://t.co/cXLJkX57Mu

2019-05-31 at 14:56:48: @visakanv @sharanvkaur I used to go to Starbucks once a week before work for a journaling session. It was one of the best parts of my week, and helped me find + maintain clarity at the time

2019-05-31 at 14:52:51: @TheAnnaGat This makes so much sense. I was equating disagreeableness with unpleasantness. 

Disagreeableness, correctly defined, especially when combined with trust and social awareness, is a great trait.

I've seen data that disagreeable people make more money too

1) be on the rise, and
2) disproportionately affect women (2/2)

2019-05-31 at 07:48:19: I believe women are more likely to have digestive issues than men. Evidence:
- more of my female friends have gut issues
- based on my poll, 2x the women had gut issues (60% v. 30%)
- 'gluten intolerance' brings to mind a cultural trope of a woman

2019-05-31 at 06:42:54: @visakanv Whoa, that would be a fun convention for us to adopt. "I love all of Visa's tweet2"

And if you really want to emphasize the plurality, just use a large number. "I love ALL of Visa's tweet100000000000"

2019-05-31 at 06:14:47: Repetition is inherently cute, just like tiny things are inherently cute

2019-05-29 at 08:07:05: A busy calendar and a busy mind will destroy your ability to create great memes.

2019-05-29 at 08:07:05: Meme-maker mentality: If you think like a meme-maker, and you act like a meme-maker, it‚Äôs only a matter of time until you become a meme-maker.

2019-05-29 at 08:07:04: Why are you on Twitter instead of working on your memes?

2019-05-29 at 08:07:04: I bet I've heard 100 meme collectives explain why they failed to raise money, and I don't think I've heard one say that the reason was that their memes seemed unpromising. And yet that is almost always the reason in the investors' minds.

2019-05-29 at 08:07:04: If you optimize for likes, it turns out you optimize for lulz

2019-05-29 at 08:07:04: I still remember how excited I was the first time I saw a meme in an ad. It was in 2005 in a pop-up ad as I was browsing forbes dot com. I thought "It's happening!"

2019-05-29 at 08:07:04: I wish meme courses were taught from a historical perspective, rather than a purely functional one. It would help so much understanding why all these memes exist -- something I'm still piecing together years later via knowyourmeme dot com and accosting gen z on the street

2019-05-29 at 08:07:03: If you're young, one thing I know for sure I would not do is go work for a big meme factory, even a prestigious one like 5chan. I'd probably either go to Z Combinator (like I did) or just start memes.

2019-05-29 at 08:07:03: The next big meme won't be a rehash of Pepe or Galaxy Brain. Think bigger. If there's no name for your meme that might be a good sign rather than a bad one

But anyways -- I'm all good üôÉ

2019-05-29 at 02:56:23: Also, I suspect that anti-social homeless behavior cannot solely be attributed to mental illness or drug use. Some of it is caused by the social shunning that we all take part in

https://t.co/hQBUHfdbx3

I suspect all content has prerequisites. All content requires a degree of familiarity with the idea-space

2019-05-27 at 19:17:13: @themikebrave @TheAnnaGat I love this answer. The moment I become 'real' friends with someone is usually:

2019-05-27 at 13:57:41: @joshwhitkin @vgr Interesting. The reason I chose 'premium mediocre' as my example is that I tested it on a millennial friend, and he grasped it right away. I suspect whether a summary is a compression or label depends on the audience

2019-05-26 at 23:18:04: I'm not saying this is a good thing, btw. I yearn for the day when there is One Messaging App To Rule Them All. That would make my life so much easier to keep track of.

2019-05-26 at 23:18:04: I visualize the app's logo and interface to help recall where, when, and with whom I discussed an idea with

2019-05-26 at 23:18:04: I inadvertently use messaging apps as a memory palace / method of loci.

1. Vaguely recall interesting idea
2. "I think I once discussed that with Person X on Platform Y!" (e.g. Slack, Messenger, Twitter DMs)
3. Look back at message to retrieve full idea

2019-05-26 at 21:49:07: @vgr Defensive pre-compression: Write an insightful article, then summarize it in a short phrase like 'premium mediocre'. That way you own both the original + compression üòã

2019-05-26 at 20:57:00: @h_thoreson Well they're very regulated in the u.s. But it seems to be either legal or grey-area legal to buy them from a British company like Daysoft. And I've found the quality quite good!

2019-05-26 at 20:35:49: @h_thoreson And without insurance you can just buy contacts from anywhere... I order mine from Daysoft and it's as easy as ordering on Amazon. Plus daily contacts are more affordable than when I had insurance (b/c more options drives price down)

2019-05-23 at 01:44:50: @vgr In your other tweet you said moloch === tragedy of the commons? Is that a phrase you use? Perhaps you agree with the concept of moloch but dislike the aesthetic and prefer other roughly equal terms ??

2019-05-23 at 01:40:34: @vgr Plus I think humans like personification. Regular humans just blame other humans ("the problems are caused by the outgroup"). Rationalists don't like to oversimplify so they created a character that represents a system.

2019-05-23 at 01:39:41: @vgr Is there a synonym for Moloch you prefer? The closest I can think of is 'incentives', but it's not a 1-to-1 mapping. So some of its value just comes from creating a useful shorthand, similar to 'premium mediocre'.

2019-05-22 at 19:48:21: @noididntreadit Do you think now-ness is necessary to keep users on Twitter? It seems like users might be interested in both new and old content, and I'm not sure that old content significantly curbs the addiction. Especially because when you reply to old content, it becomes new again!

2019-05-22 at 19:20:20: @Rahul_Ramc I mostly think in words, but sometimes I find it helpful to draw things out

2019-05-21 at 10:06:53: Or perhaps the more accurate way to say this is:

Twitter could do for social media technology what Apple did for phone technology

2019-05-21 at 10:06:53: What if Twitter added a visual, topical way of exploring tweets, that ignores chronology altogether? Like a mindmap, but with UX we can't yet imagine.

Twitter could do for associative thinking and conversing technology what Apple did for phone technology

2019-05-21 at 10:06:53: What if Twitter trained the algo to categorize similar tweets together? If you like a tweet, your TL can source older related tweets. Your timeline would be optimized to show you content most relevant to your current interests &amp; state of mind, regardless of when they were posted

2019-05-21 at 10:06:52: Meandering Tweet threads that link to other Tweet threads (see: @visakanv) seem like the first iteration of something bigger.

2019-05-21 at 09:43:47: @MaxTagher @TheAnnaGat I used to be a 2 and now I'm a 1. 1 is way more fun!!

2019-05-21 at 09:41:38: @jonni I think you are underselling drugs (or at least psychedelics). I have 'an abundance of supportive, emotionally intimate relationships', but I still find tons of value in them!

2019-05-21 at 08:40:55: I like to chase this feeling. It's really exciting to me that there are feelings that I haven't felt yet. I've recently become more ambitious, mostly because I think ambition could lead me to weird scenarios that naturally provoke brand new feelings

2019-05-21 at 08:40:54: One word that I wish existed is the meta-feeling you feel when you feel a BRAND NEW FEELING for the first time.

I felt this meta-feeling feeling the first time I fell in love, and the first time I got my heart broken. I experience this feeling vaguely like 'oh, whoa' https://t.co/bTmAydEEYQ

2019-05-21 at 08:28:55: In summary, this tweet combines two cultural moments: 
1. General fatigue with the concept of 'self care'
2. The recognition that drugs are baaaaack

https://t.co/2vovRLeBrb

2019-05-21 at 08:28:55: (Incidentally, I believe drugs are essential to "self care". Maybe that's also part of the joke?? They go hand-in-hand!)

https://t.co/YJNH1zlXqH

2019-05-21 at 08:28:55: I don't have any interesting commentary about drugs-reaching-cultural-acceptability except: finally &amp;&amp; ü•≥

2019-05-21 at 08:28:55: The second part of the tweet, 'we're doing drugs again', is funny cuz drugs recently passing some meaningful threshold of cultural acceptability. 

Weed legalized!

2019-05-21 at 08:28:55: hot take: you can enjoy enjoyable activities simply because they are enjoyable üòà

2019-05-21 at 08:28:54: On the surface, 'self-care' seems like it's diametrically opposed to work, but it's actually just re-framing fun and relaxing activities as work activities. "I really need a bubble bath tonight so that I am prepared to do Very Important Things tomorrow" hashtag self care

2019-05-21 at 08:28:54: The term 'self care' implies that your default state is ~*sTrUgGLe*~. You are constantly exhausted and in need of rest.

What a depressing worldview.

2019-05-21 at 08:28:54: You secretly hate the phrase 'self care', and rightfully so. 'Self care' is prescriptive, as if it‚Äôs something one *should* do. THIS IS HOW YOU TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. It's a killjoy phrase.

2019-05-21 at 08:28:54: I love that this tweet went viral (151k likes!). It seems to have struck a chord, and I have a theory on why:

(And yes, I'm gonna be that person who explains a joke until it's no longer funny).

2019-05-21 at 06:52:56: Is the Netherlands more communal + less concerned with achieving individual success?

Kind of, but there is a generational divide. E.g., his mom grew up in WW2, and suffered severe malnourishment. So her and his generation have a sense of gratitude; not so for Kids These Days

2019-05-21 at 06:48:44: - Dutch man says that all American movies are stories of good v. evil (e.g. star wars, the light side v dark side), whereas Dutch movies don't reenforce this narrative. And these narratives bleed into our politics

2019-05-21 at 06:47:44: - Dutch man thinks America is wedded to the 2-party system because we are so invested in Winning, and that we learn to value individualism and competition at a young age, starting with our competitive sports culture

2019-05-21 at 06:47:43: - yes, everybody bikes, and only 14% of 18-25 year old women drive

there are even bike highways and overpasses https://t.co/EGHYTsTk3L

2019-05-21 at 06:47:43: A plethora of political parties means you can find the right fit for you. For example, Dutch man cares about global warming *and* having a strong military. In America, those viewpoints can't coexist in a single party.

2019-05-21 at 06:47:43: Answers:
- yes the parliamentary system and the need to form a coalition works as well as it sounds. The incentives are aligned such that parties compromise and work together rather than getting stuck in gridlock

2019-05-21 at 06:47:43: I met to a Dutch man on the train and got to ask him my backlog of Holland questions

2019-05-21 at 06:13:40: @vidythatte @akhiljsathyan @TheAnnaGat Love this Vidy. I try doing something similar in a hackey way. I have an anonymous Twitter with no followers and I often tweet there first and then later decide whether to share publicly (on my main). Might give this a try

2019-05-21 at 06:09:26: @akhiljsathyan @TheAnnaGat @vidythatte I love screen time limits. It's my favorite thing about ios so far, it makes me feel like apple has my back

2019-05-21 at 06:03:18: @akhiljsathyan @TheAnnaGat Yup I actually just got the Twitter app a few weeks ago cuz I didn't want to feed the addiction

2019-05-21 at 02:32:57: @codexseraphin Hmm didn't see the tweet and I'm not sure I'm following

2019-05-21 at 01:22:28: @Altimor Capitalism only works if you leave outraged Yelp reviews.

"1 star. Good food but they are closed on Mondays. I WOULD LEAVE ZERO STARS IF I COULD"

2019-05-20 at 23:53:21: @vgr oops, I was under the impression this tweet was a continuation of the thread below. So I was wondering if, e.g. 'the contrarian' is based on an mbti type
https://t.co/vDftONnFgU

2019-05-20 at 23:41:48: @vgr are the player types based on mbti?

2019-05-20 at 23:36:09: @tjrwriting Incidentally, I just learned that I come from the 'Kayastha' caste, and Kayasthas have traditionally acted as scribes and keepers of public records and accounts. Seems fitting üòÅ

https://t.co/FUz7tFAW8d

2019-05-20 at 23:34:33: @tjrwriting Yes! Ghose is usually spelled 'Ghosh'. I think one of my ancestors misspelled it. I'm not sure if they were a bad speller or just trying to be hip ;)

'Ghosh' is a relatively common last name in Bengali

2019-05-20 at 23:29:26: @akhiljsathyan Two ppl to foolproof is perfect. I'm particularly thinking about coding, and having a first and second reviewer. Code gets thoroughly vetted, and also all 3 ppl have buy-in before it's merged. Plus it helps ensure consistency across app if everyone has eyes on it

2019-05-20 at 22:35:58: @tjrwriting no one knows how to pronounce ghose though, so somehow i don't think i'll make it into the zeitgeist

2019-05-20 at 22:35:27: @tjrwriting ooooooh üòç

2019-05-20 at 22:23:22: Plus, 3-person teams are big enough that your teammates can check your assumptions, and nudge you in the right direction if you're exercising poor judgment or going down the wrong path

2019-05-20 at 22:23:21: whoops, meant to thread this

https://t.co/IaGyG3m9tc

2019-05-20 at 22:21:31: In my experience, 3-person teams are optimal. They're small enough that:
1. You feel integral to the outcome
2. You can move quickly because you only need 3 ppl to agree
3. Communication is easy and key info is less likely to get lost in translation (or never transmitted at all)

2019-05-20 at 22:09:45: @thekaranchawla I'm curious if Dunbar's number increases in the age of social media. That is, can we now maintain more social connections because it's easier to keep in touch?

Dunbar's number was ascertained in the 90s, before widespread social media use.

2019-05-20 at 21:26:37: 'Dunbar's number' is such a ubiquitous idea that I assumed Dunbar must be some dude from the 1800s, and that his number had been around for centuries.

Nope, he's alive and kicking. He developed his famous number idea in the 90s. https://t.co/NAFB4ijJAw

2019-05-20 at 21:21:10: How many close friends do you have (by your own definition of close)?

2019-05-20 at 21:21:10: In your opinion, how many close friends is optimal?

2019-05-20 at 21:21:10: Dunbar's most famous number is 150, but he also claimed that, "Our studies suggest that we devote about 40 per cent of our available social time (and the same proportion of our emotional capital) to an inner core of about five shoulders-to-cry-on."

2019-05-20 at 14:42:56: @david_perell I suspect there's a useful tweeting-to-writing pipeline.

It lets you discover the power of sharing your thoughts online

2019-05-19 at 22:53:00: @codexseraphin @vgr Perhaps AI's unfair advantage will be a superior ability to coordinate with each other.

2019-05-19 at 22:50:54: @codexseraphin @vgr Exactly in the middle! That's the power of Twitter. You follow people but you often follow based on shared interests or thought quality. Then the Big Algo in the Sky does a lot of work behind the scenes. Your TL learns what you like and sources interesting content for you

2019-05-19 at 22:47:41: @codexseraphin @vgr Interesting. We now seem prefer to interact via algorithm and interest based social media like Reddit rather than friend-based social media like Facebook.

I'm not sure I can wrap my head around an AI as a person. Although I did love "Her"

2019-05-19 at 22:41:39: @codexseraphin @vgr Interesting. I think I am increasingly coming to agree with that belief.

https://t.co/8UW3vyDk5a

2019-05-19 at 06:13:25: I really like the term 'the web'.

The internet feels more and more like a web to me. No start or end, threads going off in all directions, and it's fun to get entangled in your little corner of the internet for awhile https://t.co/CvSiwY3HvA

2019-05-19 at 06:05:10: In summary, tweeting makes you smarter by:
1. Exposure to new and thought-provoking ideas
2. Conversations with smart and curious people 
3. Prompting you to hone or clarify thoughts to meet the character limit
4. Incentivizing interesting thoughts via a 'likes' endorphin rush

2019-05-19 at 06:05:10: Social media platforms are built to be addicting. You can use this to your advantage. When you tweet and someone likes it you get a rush of endorphins. You might start to chase the rush, and your subconscious works overtime to have 'interesting' thoughts. https://t.co/V8feseqRBo

2019-05-19 at 06:05:10: The space constraints of a tweet can be useful. You are forced to condense thoughts into a clear nugget. Sometimes this helps you hone in on a key idea. 

https://t.co/BJS52VZmPG

2019-05-19 at 06:05:10: Being on Twitter is like keeping your 'door' open to new perspectives

https://t.co/5asd3nOpUD

2019-05-19 at 06:05:10: Twitter can also make you smarter by exposing you to new ideas at a rapid pace. (Read @KevinSimler's 'Going Critical' for an explanation of how dense networks like Twitter spread knowledge and generate ideas)

https://t.co/xjy2hrInH8

2019-05-19 at 06:05:09: And the best part is, you can participate! If you reply to a tweet or conversation, you will often (not always) get a reply back.

Conversations, especially with smart, interesting people, are a great way to learn. (That's why colleges have seminars).

2019-05-19 at 06:05:08: Instead of just seeing one lonely tweet,  you'll see conversations...these can be far more interesting and insightful than a 280-character tweet.

2019-05-19 at 06:05:08: .@jack's been trying to make Twitter into a conversational platform rather than a bunch of bullhorns, with some success. If you start following people who talk to one another, your TL will show their conversations prominently.

2019-05-19 at 06:05:08: Once you've eliminated negativity from your timeline, you'll want to add in more positivity by following positive people who share your interests. A few of my FFs are @visakanv (EQ), @webdevMason (education), @vgr (social trends), @fortelabs (productivity) &amp; @devonzuegel (cities)

2019-05-19 at 06:05:08: If you want, you can avoid all politics until a week before the election, and binge-learn about candidates. This is a great way to filter out the noise...let time and politics junkies filter for you. You can still be a Good Citizen who makes a Good Decision on election day

2019-05-19 at 06:05:08: Instead, you can form political opinions (if you wish to) directly from the source. Watch interviews with candidates. Read long-form political news from outlets you trust (if they exist). 

https://t.co/psYdXxvLQZ

2019-05-19 at 06:05:07: Does it make you a worse human to not follow politics on Twitter? No, not at all. The 24 hour news cycle is an addiction much worse than Twitter. You might feel like you're Doing Something Good by staying up-to-date, but you're mostly just stressing yourself out

2019-05-19 at 06:05:07: As a precaution against allowing unwanted negativity into my life, I mark any political tweet as 'Show less often' too. Some people go into their Settings and mute political words like 'Trump' or 'AOC'

2019-05-19 at 06:05:07: You are not obligated to follow anyone. Ruthlessly unfollow negative people. Or if someone posts or retweets something negative, tell Twitter's algorithm you're not interested (click upper right arrow =&gt; "Show less often") https://t.co/1N9SZ7o0TG

2019-05-19 at 06:05:07: Like anything else, Twitter is what you make of it. Some of my friends claim that Twitter is full of negativity, but personally, my timeline is full of love and insight.

2019-05-19 at 03:50:06: @samuelmachat @vgr Agreed. It's a fairly new skill for humans, and one we're not taught

2019-05-19 at 03:49:20: @samuelmachat @vgr I'd imagine the avg millennial spends a lot of time on the internet. And there are endless YouTube channels (e.g), and the YT algo pushes people towards increasingly personalized content. Our interests diverge far more than analog age... Not sure where it caps out on avg though

2019-05-19 at 02:32:51: @michael_nielsen @paulg @KevinSimler Perhaps one way to simulate this pressure in essay writing is to write drafts in numbered list form, separating each thought. (Then you could remove the numbers before you publish).

I am thinking of some @vgr articles like https://t.co/RPkOchbrrX

2019-05-19 at 02:19:25: @samuelmachat @vgr Moving to a city is lonely until you find 'your people'. And if you never find them, a city might feel lonely forever. And perhaps the loneliness is perceived more intensely because you are 'alone in a crowded room'

2019-05-19 at 02:14:55: @samuelmachat @vgr small towns = proximity-based relationships. Everyone part of community by default
suburbia + cities = no default community. Ppl must seek out friends via shared interests

but cities have higher-density, making it easier to find higher-compatibility friend matches

2019-05-19 at 00:09:55: @LamaAlRajih @jzlegion I really like the parenthetical qualifier on this tweet. Precision is a good look

2019-05-19 at 00:04:40: @strive4liberty @MaxTagher Yes I think that's a good insight. I think people's values and interests are in flux, but when you are in school or college, it's easy to make new/additional friends as your interests change (perhaps you are in a club together). As an adult it takes extra effort

2019-05-18 at 23:38:08: @kurtsy Yes, I try to! I love to host and I've been wanting to host more. Sometimes it kind of works, other times people don't connect or they live far away from one another or are busy

2019-05-18 at 23:27:00: @paarsec That sounds awesome. Is it annual? This is my first time hearing of it

2019-05-18 at 23:18:30: @EvanSandhoefner Yes, definitely. I also wonder whether previous generations cared about loneliness as much. They might have had more compelling worries; As it becomes easier to meet our practical needs, we have more brain power to focus on (and stress about) psychological needs

2019-05-18 at 23:11:38: @paarsec Ok I'll bite. What's eurovision

2019-05-18 at 23:08:58: @aaron_etc I tried reading Bowling Alone once and thought it was alright. I think the book is well-known because it pointed to a phenomenon early, before others had noticed. I'm not sure if it's still worth reading or not

Mathematically, you save 10 minutes. But in those 10 minutes in a taxi, you didn't experience anything."

2019-05-18 at 15:34:00: @robinhanson LA used to use privatized parking enforcement. They had no incentive to be honest or accurate.

2019-05-18 at 12:54:16: @visakanv Lol at mid night wake-ups when you've been trying to avoid your feelings

When I'm avoiding my feelings I sleep forever. Sorry subconscious I don't have time for you, gotta get my 8-10 hours, haven't you read that sleep book everyone is talking about nothing personal bye

2019-05-18 at 12:46:45: @sravanti__ @visakanv My wake-up time is heavily dependent on my mood. But when I'm generally happy, I wake up this early. 

My mom's the same way -- she got up at 5:30 for most of my life

2019-05-18 at 12:36:10: @visakanv how can i sleep when I have so many feelings

2019-05-18 at 12:16:43: @visakanv This is normal Priya wake-up time! Without alarm!

2019-05-18 at 04:46:45: @patwater @whatstheii @paulg @KevinSimler It's a bug if the addiction isn't serving you. But you can also harness the addiction for good!

2019-05-18 at 04:29:36: @patwater @whatstheii @paulg @KevinSimler True! But Twitter and other forms of social media are built to be addicting, thus encouraging you to take more notes and have more ideas

https://t.co/x7fuy3wZqj

2019-05-17 at 22:41:30: @paulg @KevinSimler True. I've found that if I tweet ideas, and if I thread tweets (so I have more space to think), then I end up having more ideas over the course of the day...because my ideas have an outlet.

But that might not generalize

2019-05-17 at 22:26:39: Have you found that tweeting changes the way you think?

Does that ring true to you?

2019-05-17 at 16:05:46: @TheAnnaGat That makes sense! What kind of people fit in and feel connected in London?

2019-05-17 at 13:57:59: @clintRhea Agreed!

I have a copy of death and life of great American cities but I haven't read it yet

2019-05-17 at 13:53:29: @MaxTagher It's hard to parse sample bias. 

I regularly see friends from high school and college since I still live nearby &amp; many of my previously charming and social friends feel lonely. Some of them have 'friends' but don't see them enough, or feel disconnected from them

2019-05-17 at 13:35:22: Also:
- cross country moves to pl pursue economic opportunities (although @tylercowen says we're moving less than ever)

2019-05-17 at 13:33:56: @MaxTagher Yes. What about in your experience?

2019-05-17 at 12:47:32: @gamesmasterg9 I'm curious if other cities that work these hours also form strong friendships. I'm reminded of Korea, which seems to have a work hard play hard culture where co-workers often drink together

2019-05-17 at 12:43:22: @samuelmachat @vgr That happened to me too. I also became less lonely when I moved to the city, and generally find that my suburban friends seem lonelier than my city friends

2019-05-17 at 08:49:33: @aaronzlewis Looks interesting, looking forward to reading

2019-05-17 at 08:43:50: @codeic @visakanv @danielgross @danariely @juliagalef Yeah I think you need a few runners out front too, but you want to feel in top % on average

2019-05-17 at 08:35:25: @akhiljsathyan There seems to be merit to this. I think we have inborn qualities and inclinations that we can nurture into strengths. But some strengths are just a factor of your environment. E.g. 90% of my ping pong proficient friends grew up with tables at home

2019-05-17 at 08:18:45: Would you tweet about the second coming of Jesus?

2019-05-17 at 08:11:07: https://t.co/G8RiBAm0Ac

2019-05-17 at 08:11:07: Personality is context dependent

2019-05-17 at 08:11:07: Likewise I'm sure people who seem shy or on guard might just be reacting to my energy

2019-05-17 at 08:11:07: The Observer Effect, but for social dynamics.

You can only get to know someone in the context of how they interact with you. Sometimes I think my friends are just extremely open or trusting or extraverted, but it's only because that's how they act when they're around me

2019-05-17 at 08:08:27: I know many homeless ppl have pre-existing mental health issues...but I'm not sure they all did. Sometimes, someone on Bart will seem fairly lucid, but they will still talk to no one in particular. They are talking to the whole train, hoping anyone is listening

2019-05-17 at 08:08:27: So one way to interpret people talking themselves on the streets of SF is that they were so deeply hurt by having no one to talk to that they invented characters in their head to talk to

2019-05-17 at 08:08:26: Humans heal emotional wounds through *community*

Lack of community is itself a deep emotional wound that can drive a person crazy. Sometimes I wonder if homeless people who talk to themselves lost their faculties via deep loneliness *after* becoming homeless

2019-05-17 at 08:08:26: U.S. soldiers often miss the camaraderie of the battlefield. Rates of PTSD in soldiers correlates to a society's ability to reintegrate a soldier back into society. If I'm remembering 'Tribe' correctly, integration is more predictive than how traumatic the battles themselves were

2019-05-17 at 07:56:21: @visakanv @danielgross @danariely I'm reminded of some tweets somewhere in the rationalist sphere (@juliagalef??) about how the best way to build self-esteem in a big pond (i.e. the modern, global world) is to find a subgroup where you can stand out in

2019-05-17 at 07:54:21: @visakanv @danielgross @danariely Been thinking on this quote lately. How can you put yourself in exactly the right environment, where you feel capable (in comparison to others), but they're close enough to your ability that you still feel healthy competition? And how do you change environments as you 'level up'?

2019-05-17 at 07:51:12: @akhiljsathyan I see the optics of pain post-trip, and I suppose you're right that that's the truly healing part...seeing the stories that you are telling yourself. But sometimes during, it just feels like an amplification of pain!

2019-05-17 at 07:49:54: @visakanv I once went snorkeling and I screamed into my snorkel the whole time üòÖ

2019-05-17 at 07:48:27: @visakanv Strong agree! It's kind of like yoga. You have to listen to your body. You can't push yourself too hard, or you will hurt yourself more.

2019-05-17 at 07:45:46: The engineer in me is often tempted to be direct. Usually in hindsight I realize that humans leave some things ambiguous for a reason. Ambiguity lets relationships unfold naturally, and gives us more room to play!

2019-05-17 at 07:45:46: In SF we complain about the ambiguity of our relationships: there's a cultural meme where you think someone wants to be your friend but they actually want to recruit you. Or worse, you think you're going on a date!

But the upside (lasting relationships) is worth the ambiguity

2019-05-17 at 07:45:46: For example in London, tinder dates that could turn into fulfilling friendships don't. "It was a date, so it's yes  / nothing"

"and as a consequence people have no friends and network very little"

2019-05-17 at 07:45:46: .@TheAnnaGat told me that she thinks Londoners are lonely because they *don't* have a culture of relationship fluidity.

If you compartmentalize relationships, you lose relationships over time. https://t.co/vLgohM8SgM

2019-05-17 at 07:43:10: Relationship fluidity is part of why SF work culture is so relaxed. You don't need to be completely buttoned up around friends and potential friends.

2019-05-17 at 07:43:09: A key tenet of the SF ethos is that all relationships are fluid. You 'play long term games with long term people' because those relationships change and grow over time. 

Friends become co-founders. A recruitment process leads to a friendship. A Twitter friend refers you.

2019-05-17 at 07:41:26: I have no evidence at all for this theory...what do y'all think?

2019-05-17 at 07:41:25: 6. LSD lets you feel more emotional pain than you can usually handle. Perhaps you process 30 e.p. in a single day. That's a "bad trip", but it's also why trips can ultimately be healing. If you're person A, you've essentially condensed 7 months of healing into 1 day.

2019-05-17 at 07:41:25: 3. Some people repress the pain, and only feel little bits of it at a time
4. Let's say person A only lets themselves feel 1 e.p. per week (perhaps that's all they can handle!). It will take them 100 weeks to heal.
5. Person B feels 10 e.p. per week, and 'heals' in 10 weeks.

2019-05-17 at 07:41:25: I believe healing from emotional pain is a product of how intensely you allow yourself to feel the pain:
1. Think of emotional pain as a quantity. Let's say losing a loved one is 100 units of emotional pain (e.p.)
2. Healing requires being present to the pain over time

2019-05-17 at 07:19:26: another possible cause of loneliness epidemic might be higher standards?? now that we have the internet, we know there are other people who share our niche interests and patterns of thinking. and that might make us notice when we are different from those around us.

2019-05-17 at 07:19:26: possible causes of loneliness epidemic:
- long commutes
- living alone or with 1-2 friends
- longer working hours (with both genders working, so there isn't one dedicated gender that is organizing social events and maintaining community ties)
- decline of churches

2019-05-04 at 18:45:38: @BrennerSpear And that's especially helpful because Amazon's search algorithm doesn't seem very good. They have prioritized promotions over personalization

2019-05-04 at 18:44:55: @BrennerSpear I also think it would be cool to search all my friends' Amazon purchases in aggregate. It would be a good starting point when I want to buy something. Like, which headphones have my friends bought?

2019-04-15 at 18:06:45: @TheAnnaGat Yes, I suppose that's strange. I think it's because the categories are fairly wishy-washy. They just point in a direction. Do you identify with either type more, or not really?

2019-04-15 at 18:04:49: @TheAnnaGat But it's no surprise that Big 5 is more consistent for you...Big 5 has been studied more, and the 5 traits apparently remain consistent throughout your life. I didn't personally find Big 5 as helpful though, in terms of understanding myself or others

2019-03-22 at 14:24:06: It's a different thinking paradigm. When you write on paper or in a text editor, you string together many thoughts in one order. You can't re-arrange thoughts without writing a whole new document

2019-03-22 at 14:00:53: BART already had 'carpool' spots, but they were hard to enforce, and being mis-used by single drivers. Scoop makes enforcement easy.

2019-03-22 at 14:00:53: In 2016 the Federal Transit Administration awarded $8M to transit agencies to experiment with ride-sharing programs. 

BART used its share of the money to incentivize carpooling to Bart stations via the carpooling app Scoop. This helps alleviate high demand for Bart parking.

- saved ~$2000 a year in car-related expenses
- enjoyed the ride more than a car https://t.co/VzH7xAFWgr

2019-03-18 at 06:54:24: @polite_netizen I think it's because I was deep in the store and my cell service was shoddy. Perhaps they need WiFi so we can download in stores! (Or perhaps they have wifi and I just didn't check)

2019-03-18 at 06:35:59: @polite_netizen There was a sign telling me to download the consumer app, and that you could search by aisle. I started to but the download was slow and I got distracted

2019-03-17 at 22:28:38: @findalejandro Yes, perhaps you are right. In my case I bought nothing, and am now unlikely to go back to either store for a year or two. But I'm probably not the target market anymore (and I already use Amazon for almost everything).

"And the pathway forward is...by the adoption of responsibility for the conditions of existence and some attempt on your part to actually rectify them"

https://t.co/06vcVywZYG

2019-03-14 at 13:09:52: @polite_netizen True. I guess the similarity I am trying to point at is that I don't think it's helpful to frame helping the homeless as a moral obligation. Rather, it's something that someone who holds themselves to high standards takes responsibility for.

2019-03-14 at 05:28:23: @MaxTagher lol. Is a tweet thread every *really* dead? (My heart says no)

2019-03-14 at 05:23:14: @MaxTagher this does read as a despondent tweet, huh

2019-03-14 at 05:08:44: @joshjob42 Yeah it's weird how you can miss things like that. I watch South Park but I've never seen that episode...and no one explicitly mentions it when they reference the meme. I'm curious what % of people using that meme know where it comes from

2019-03-14 at 04:44:46: @vgr Relatable: "They arise in the call of the wild, a call that somehow, deep down, you know you can trust."

2019-03-14 at 04:43:05: The original is: "Collect underpants", "?", "Profit"

2019-03-13 at 13:52:11: @trylks But my overall point is that there are other creative solutions that we haven‚Äôt thought of yet. Would love to see more brainpower going into this issue!

2019-03-13 at 13:51:33: @trylks This will make it easier for non-profits, churches and private orgs to help house the homeless. We also need more city-wide shelter beds.

2019-03-13 at 13:50:29: @trylks CA recently made it legal to create formalized, safe living spaces via AB2176. ‚ÄúIt allows the city to temporarily suspend state building, safety and health codes for the purpose of building ‚Äúunconventional‚Äù housing structures ‚Äî everything from wood-framed sheds to tiny homes.‚Äú

2019-03-13 at 13:49:19: @trylks However‚Ä¶

SV ‚Äòelites‚Äô often hide behind our admittedly poor housing policy to ignore the crisis we have on our hands now. Changing laws is a coordination/incentive problem, and might take years to happen.

We need coordinated efforts to house the homeless, today. (cont...)

2019-03-13 at 13:48:17: @trylks My take: our current incidence of homelessness is rooted in housing costs.

Therefore lowering housing costs via building more units (via changing laws about what‚Äôs allowed to be built where) is the best long-term solution.

https://t.co/Qo05c6GPG4

2019-03-13 at 13:47:07: @trylks Didn't mean to lionize SF...homelessness is just a big problem here, which is why I was emphasizing our ability to address it. Homelessness can be solved elsewhere, and I know other cities are doing good things in this area.

2019-03-13 at 13:16:21: @kimmaicutler Oh wow, I didn't realize that. That page is Orwellian...it's double-speak to lump buying bus tickets elsewhere with finding relatives for someone to stay with. Also funny that they call it 'problem-solving' if they mean bussing out.

2019-03-13 at 06:04:53: Very interesting: Marin pilots a public on-demand ride-sharing program, similar to Uber or Lyft. They use nine-seat vans that can accommodate wheelchairs. A monthly pass is $40. https://t.co/0XUra5tP4o

2019-03-13 at 05:40:37: @ycombinator For a realistic, empathetic look at what it's like to be homeless, I recommend this book üëáüèΩ

It's a non-fiction book about two college kids who decide to be voluntarily homeless for 6 months.

https://t.co/FvWTw5bnXF

2019-03-13 at 05:38:05: Curious if there are any social good accelerators that follow a @ycombinator type model

2019-03-13 at 05:38:05: It's easily within our power to fix this problem. SF is one the wealthiest cities with one of the highest concentrations of creative, capable people. Collectively, we have solved a lot of problems.

2019-03-13 at 05:24:33: In the event of an earthquake or emergency that affected rich, high-status people, we would immediately provide transitional housing to everyone affected. We have money set aside in our gov't budgets to account for these scenarios. Are we not currently in an emergency?

2019-03-13 at 05:22:33: We treat war criminals and prisoners better than we treat our homeless. They are at least entitled to basic necessities like food, water, shelter, and even medical care.

2019-03-13 at 05:14:00: We have a major crisis on our hands. Living conditions like these are only otherwise seen in the third world. How are we okay with letting this happen here?

2019-03-13 at 05:13:59: As Kim-Mai Cutler's story revealed in the linked thread, people are dying in the street. (I also once overheard a conversation between two homeless people about a friend who had passed away recently, and was buried under the overpass.)

2019-03-13 at 05:13:58: I'm not sure what to do about this. In the end, someone has to take responsibility, and I think it may as well be us.

2019-03-13 at 05:13:58: And it even happens *within* San Francisco. Supervisors from other districts have admitted to sending homeless to The Tenderloin. Police will tell drug dealers to go do it in the Tenderloin.

2019-03-13 at 05:13:57: Other cities do the same. Some have been caught, some have not. We can file lawsuits, but in the end we are still paying a high cost for this practice.

2019-03-13 at 05:13:56: In 2015, SF won a $400k settlement against Nevada. Nevada was dumping mentally ill patients on us.

https://t.co/oQl4Tes5S6

2019-03-13 at 05:13:56: There was one compelling argument that I'm not sure how to respond to. And that is 'if we build shelters, it will cause more homeless people from other cities to move here'. 

This is a true statement. Other cities bus their homeless and mentally ill to SF. (cont)

2019-03-13 at 04:53:42: The NIMBYs from tonight's hearing fall into 3 categories:
1. The latte liberals: "We care about the homeless, as long as it doesn't affect us"
2. The shameless cynics: "Homeless people should all go to jail"

2019-02-26 at 15:52:57: @AndrewRCraig Interesting. I have been mis-interpreting small-L libertarian all this time.

2019-02-26 at 09:33:15: @1_swimbeast Yes, I think you may be right. Dave Rubin seems to own the term classical liberal nowadays, and as such it's a term that's come to mean being Against something (far-leftism) rather than For something.

2019-02-26 at 07:03:36: @joshjob42 Right. I think libertarianism was a shaky umbrella for people on the left and right without any other home. But there were disagreements beneath the surface

2019-02-26 at 06:52:01: Neoliberalism, circa 2019, cont: pro-gay-rights, accepting of all genders, races etc.

2019-02-26 at 06:52:00: Neoliberalism, circa 2019, cont: Free market economics is a good default or baseline, but not a sacred cow. If a city proves another model is superior, let's d0 it

2019-02-26 at 06:52:00: Neoliberalism, circa 2019: The state should create policies that lead to dense, pedestrian-friendly cities to increase the incidence of citizens with access to good jobs.

https://t.co/7XuCz4Z0o7

2019-02-26 at 06:12:59: @ConorMccammon I hear ya. I thought the same thing about 2 hours ago. The problem is that it's really hard to get a term to catch on. It's actually much easier to mold a term to fit your needs than to invent a new term

2019-02-26 at 06:11:18: @ConorMccammon The term has existed since the 1930s, but it's meaning has shifted over time.
1930s: promote a market economy *via a strong state*
1960s: term heavily declines
1980s: term is revived but means to promote a market economy *via laissez faire economics*

2019-02-26 at 06:07:24: @ConorMccammon The wikipedia article is pretty interesting here:
"Modern advocates of free market policies avoid the term 'neoliberal' and some scholars have described the term as meaning different things to different people as neoliberalism 'mutated' into geopolitically distinct hybrids..."

2019-02-26 at 06:05:37: @ConorMccammon Perhaps I should have used the term 're-branding' as opposed to 'branding'. The term neoliberalism has been around, but I think it is being revived and re-branded to encompass housing policy, transit, and continued experimentation

2019-02-26 at 06:02:35: But perhaps I'm just a conspiracy theorist. "News Feed Eradicator for Facebook" (which I highly recommend) only has 100k users... a drop in the bucket for Facebook or Twitter.

2019-02-26 at 06:02:35: At the time, I thought this was just a quirk or remnant of how Twitter was built. But now I suspect it may have been built this way deliberately, to remove the ability for individuals to block the news feed.

2019-02-26 at 06:02:34: I once tried to build a Chrome extension that would block my Twitter newsfeed. I wanted to use it to help enable periods of focus, without missing notifications or messages. But I discovered that the only hack to remove your news feed ALSO removes your notifications.

2019-02-26 at 06:02:34: Perhaps the intent is to get me reading my Twitter feed, so that I am hooked and continue to read. As opposed to checking my notifications and then immediately leaving.

2019-02-26 at 06:02:33: Meanwhile, Twitter seems to have built in a delay before showing you notifications. My entire feed loads, and then  notifications won't show for another 10-20 seconds. The delay is so substantial that I assume it must be deliberate.

2019-02-26 at 05:24:25: @visakanv @webdevMason What is this 3 comma thang you're doing lately Visa?

2019-02-26 at 04:57:28: IMO there will be (has been?) a mass exodus from Libertarian-ish to Neoliberal and/or Classical Liberal. Those are terms you can adopt whole-heartedly, without caveats

2019-02-26 at 04:57:28: That's why you have people like @tylercowen calling themselves 'small L libertarians', or others claiming they are 'libertarian-leaning'. Many people who identify as libertarian are Libertarian-With-Caveats

2019-02-26 at 04:57:27: @ne0liberal On a related note: I don't think there are many Libertarians in the world. Many people don't relate to Liberalism or Conservatism. There adopted "Libertarianism" because it's the next Big Easily-Understandable Label that shares *some of* their values.

2019-02-26 at 04:29:54: Also: Being perceived as Fun and Playful helps a political movement gain steam. Lefties love AOC dancing, and the far right got tons of traction through NPCs and Chad v Virgin memes. Thus: @ne0liberal's shill brackets are terrific

2019-02-26 at 04:29:54: In summary, I think writing this tweet-thread just changed my own mind. I am excited that the term 'neoliberal' is catching on

2019-02-26 at 04:29:53: The @ne0liberal  bio describes a neolib as a "radical incrementalist".  Again, the focus is on improving things over time, whereas 'classical' liberal just sounds like People Who Don't Want Things to Change.

2019-02-26 at 04:29:53: I love @ne0liberal's branding as Forward Thinking. Their Twitter header emphasizes issues that haven't historically been central to the Liberal platform: biking, urban density, and making data-driven decisions.

2019-02-26 at 04:29:53: It seems like there are two competing terms for (roughly) the same idea-set: classical liberal and neoliberal.

I like the sentiment behind neoliberal more. 'Neo' means new, whereas 'classical' implies old. The term 'neoliberal' emphasizes that this is a forward-looking movement

2019-02-26 at 04:29:52: Does the prefix 'neo' have a stigma?

I really love what @ne0liberal is doing, but I am having a hard time getting behind the term 'neoliberal'.

2019-02-26 at 03:59:43: @ne0liberal To be fair, if we were in a world full of autonomous vehicles, people would feel safe in Smart car-sized cars (since the risk of getting in a car crash would be minimal)

2019-02-17 at 03:35:51: @0pfour @_TamaraWinter In SF, Bart goes directly to the airport. But we have other transit issues, in that most of the city is only served by buses rather than a subway, and those buses are slow and infrequent due to traffic and under-funding.

2019-02-17 at 03:34:29: @MaxTagher @Altimor Car-buying in America is akin to an arms race. We keep buying bigger and bigger cars out of (legitimate) fears for our safety. But that forces others to buy bigger and bigger cars out of legitimate fear for theirs.

2019-02-17 at 03:32:12: @MaxTagher @Altimor That's a very natural survival response. In fact, people are buying more SUVs (presumably due to better safety ratings), and it's lead to a huge increase of pedestrian deaths in the last ten years (see thread üëáüèΩ)

2019-02-17 at 03:12:10: .@algolia seems to be bringing high-quality search to businesses that aren't at Google scale (or just have other things to focus on). Which I find very exciting!

2019-02-17 at 03:12:10: Search is hard to do well, and Google is still head and shoulders above others. Often it makes more sense to search 'site:https://t.co/bV0OtgraIR yourSearchQuery' than to use a site's internal search

2019-02-17 at 03:12:10: I am also unable to find apps with useful discover features. I have had podcasts app in the past that send me push notifications recommending some very popular, but IMO boring podcast that is irrelevant to my interests or listening history

2019-02-17 at 03:12:10: My current app (Pocket Casts) does not seem to let me search by individual episode titles. On the Breaker website you can search by episode title, but you can't narrow the search to only look for episodes from a specific podcast.

2019-02-17 at 03:12:10: What is the podcast app to rule them all?

2019-02-16 at 21:12:23: [1] Seattle uses number of households served by frequent transit as a KPI. That is, how many households are within a 10 minute walk of a bus line that runs at least every 10 minutes?
That number has soared from 25% in 2015 to 64% in 2017 https://t.co/7AETzuG630

2019-02-16 at 21:12:22: Despite its growing population, Seattle reduced driving 5% since 2006 by:

Jack "Tech-Nerd" Dorsey: It's so close to thinking! That to me is the most beautiful thing about Twitter. ‚ù§Ô∏è

2019-02-04 at 10:57:52: More questions @jack is chewing on:
- How do we identify credible voices within a particular domain? If you‚Äôre an expert on some topic, how do we recognize that in real-time and showcase that to provide more context to who you‚Äôre talking to?

(I wonder what this will look like!)

2019-02-04 at 10:57:51: More negative incentives:
2. "We incentivize outrage, because some of the dynamics of the service not allowing nuance earlier on" 

(I assume this is why they raised the character limit and allowed for threading)

2019-02-04 at 10:57:51: Right now, avoiding echo chambers takes self-awareness and restraint:
https://t.co/I6uRUyRERZ

2019-02-04 at 10:57:51: ...A lot of folks just will not follow accounts that have a completely different perspective. If instead you follow the hashtag, 95% of the comments would show that perspective, but there‚Äôs a few that would not. We don‚Äôt make it easy for anyone to do that."

2019-02-04 at 10:57:51: Joe Rogan: "How are you going to get people to be more considerate?"
Jack: "Providing more context. Take Brexit: If I follow accounts that are only giving me reasons to leave, I only see that perspective...

2019-02-04 at 10:57:51: But incentives are still mostly skewed negatively:
1. "Right now, we do incentivize a lot of echo chambers because we don‚Äôt make it easy to follow a lot of interesting topics, only accounts"

(Speculation: Twitter will add the ability to follow hashtags soon)

2019-02-04 at 10:57:50: (I noticed recently that Twitter mobile now makes your number of Tweets more prominent. As far as metrics go, I think this is incentivizing the right thing: it's incentivizing participation and contribution, rather than popularity.) https://t.co/9XxqezA4S2

2019-02-04 at 10:57:50: ‚ÄúWhat we want to incentivize more is we want more people contributing things back to the network. I know it doesn‚Äôt feel like this on Twitter, but my ideal is someone walks away from Twitter learning something entirely new."
-@jack

2019-02-04 at 10:57:50: - What does the like button incentivize? 
- What does the re-tweet incentivize? 
- What does the number of followers, and making that number big and bold incentivize?

2019-02-04 at 10:57:50: .@jack seems to be asking good questions. Some questions he and the rest of the Twitter team are thinking about:
- When people open Twitter, what are we incentivizing?

2019-02-04 at 10:57:50: Another way in which @jack seems humble, is that he doesn't really claim credit for creating Twitter. Instead he says Twitter was invented by the people -- users were the ones who came up with the hashtag and @'ing. Twitter just noticed and built those out into real capabilities

2019-02-04 at 10:57:50: Thus it's not clear on how to handle pseudonymous accounts. In addressing this issue, Twitter again reached out for help. They spoke to both online harassment organizations and free-speech organizations like the ACLU, to try to strike the right balance

2019-02-04 at 10:57:50: As a giant platform, Twitter's issues are never straightforward. Take pseudonymous accounts, which can help whistleblowers and journalists who might fear for their career or even their life under certain regimes, but also allows others to spread abuse and harassment

2019-02-04 at 10:57:49: He seems humble, and that humility has affected how Twitter handles crises. E.g. when ISIS started using Twitter, Twitter reached out to the government and their 'peer companies' (presumably FB &amp; YouTube) for advice

2019-01-19 at 19:09:56: When I stopped to notice these thoughts (with prompting from conversations and Twitter), I realized they are absurd. I'm not sure it's possible to be 'bad' at history, and getting in trouble for not doing my homework seems trivial

2019-01-19 at 19:09:56: This week I noticed two of those beliefs:
1. I had a long-standing belief that I am "bad at" history

The red suit was popularized in the 1930s by Coca-Cola ads, and now it is difficult to picture him in anything else.

2018-11-01 at 00:36:48: But we want voice to imitate a conversation, so we prefer it to be *varied* rather than consistent. (Yet still reasonably predictable). https://t.co/Cc6Fnh8ckZ

2018-11-01 at 00:36:48: It takes effort to learn how a visual interface works, so we want the interface to be consistent. That's why so many users get annoyed when platforms do a big re-design, and often claim the re-design is worse than the old design. There's a learning curve.

2018-11-01 at 00:36:47: In a voice app, there is no interface to constrain the user. The designer cannot create an icon and decree it to mean 'post'. Instead, the designer must anticipate how a diverse array of users might attempt to 'post' something.

-They don't smoke or drink
-Some even abstain from caffeine
-They eat a vegetarian diet
-They get regular exercise
-They take a day of rest each week
-They eat a lot of nuts

2018-02-05 at 08:00:46: 2. Seventh day Adventists live long lives because their religion promotes healthy behaviors. It preaches that the body and soul are one, so taking care of the body is taking care of the soul.

2018-01-27 at 15:59:26: @trylks This article made me think of the 'libertarian-to-alt-right' pipeline. I've seen friends go from libertarian to alt right to something more moderate.

2018-01-27 at 15:51:41: @trylks Reason might play that role in the long-term. But I think this article is pointing to an issue in the short-term: the dangers of casting off a belief within a belief system when we don't fully understand the original purpose of that discarded belief

2017-09-14 at 11:50:59: @commeownists 2/ The proper response is still to argue, not call names - that's how you change someone's mind. And Ben did change his mind and recant

2017-09-14 at 11:48:56: @commeownists Pro transfer, not genocide. But either way, I agree, it's not a morally upstanding viewpoint. 1/
