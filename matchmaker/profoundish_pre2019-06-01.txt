2019-05-30 at 04:22:13: @eatenbyawhale @Teelabird Depends on the person. Generally yes but when it feels right (usually close femme friends) it actually feels great to get dude'd. Knowing that their sense of my gender is so strong they treat me like cis women, without walking on eggshells to remember. It's nice.

2019-05-29 at 10:15:35: (Real talk the *actual* reason I tweeted this is that I'm used to smoking after my night shift before I go to bed, and I'm missing the ritual. It's honestly less that I want to be high right now and more that it doesn't feel like bedtime yet because I haven't smoked. Yeah.)

2019-05-29 at 10:11:09: I have no plans to remove weed from my life, but I'm tired of not using it on my own terms. I'm getting help getting there, and I'm being kind to myself, trusting that I really want this, even when I lose ground. If you want this, you can do it. And you don't have to do it alone.

2019-05-29 at 10:11:09: Having a problem with weed (call it addiction or not) doesn't mean you have to go to rehab and quit cold turkey forever. Maybe those are the best options for some, but I think that people get scared thinking that's their only option, so scared they ignore the problem.

2019-05-29 at 10:11:09: But you do have to acknowledge that you have a problem before you can decide you want to fix it. And so whike I hope that being open will help me stay accountable to my goals, I'm also hoping that by being open about this I can help people be open with themselves.

2019-05-29 at 10:11:08: If you feel like weed has control of your life, fight back. Whether your goal is abstinence or reduced usage, there are ways to get there and people who will support you. The progress doesn't have to be linear or impressive. Just one step at a time.

2019-05-29 at 10:11:08: We often discourage people from talking about weed in terms of addiction, and this main supporter in my struggle agrees that it is a very different kind of addiction, but they have also seen the impact it has on my life (like 95% financial) and sees I'm not in full control.

2019-05-29 at 10:11:07: As always, I tweet this largely for the diary. But I also wanted to say to anyone reading this who isn't happy with their relationship to weed: it can change. It is a challenge, and if you need help please reach out to someone -- me, if you want. But you can do it.

2019-05-29 at 10:11:06: I have a lot of support, in particular someone who has struggled with addiction themself. Different chemicals, and now living in abstinence. They won't lie, they think it will be hard. But they support my goal of just reducing usage, and they believe in me. They know I can do it.

2019-05-29 at 10:11:06: It's still hard. Feels like I've stepped into a depressive episode, anhedonic, low energy,  but instead of emotionally flat I'm more irritable and more likely to be mad at the state of my life and the world. This, and withdrawal itself, makes my ideation act up too.

2019-05-29 at 10:11:05: CW: addiction. So, I have a weed addiction, and like many people who've struggled with it my goal isn't total abstinence, but my plan is to take breaks lower my tolerance and help reset my habits, because I can't just will myself into it. I'm starting small, just a few days.

2019-05-16 at 07:11:34: What does he want *me* to do? Take better care of myself? Take up a cross and burn myself out on it? Fight the oppressor? Love my friends family and partners more deeply? Pray more? Waste less time praying and more time doing? Focus on my family? Fight for the whole world?

2019-05-16 at 07:11:33: Would he ride into Washington DC in the back of a donkey? Would he go to the Alabama statehouse and start flipping tables? Would he call some new disciples? To do what? Would he go around curing the sick, healing the wounded in body and mind and heart?

2019-05-16 at 07:11:32: I really do hope we're at the end times. It means Jesus would be coming back. Jesus, the one who embodies love and reason and righteous anger, who knows Godde will fight for us and knows how to get Her to actually do it. We need a Messiah right now.

2019-05-16 at 07:11:31: What could possibly change things? What could save us? Love is worth fighting to protect but it doesn't feel like a force in the fight anymore. What has broken love? How do we fix it? What else should we look toward? Reason? Righteous anger? A messianic figure?

2019-05-16 at 07:11:31: I'm lying here next to one of my wonderful partners, and I love her so much, but love has never felt so trite, so feeble, in the face of hatred and greed. Love used to be my North Star. I still believe in Love, I love Love and I seek and respect it. But it seems powerless.

2019-05-16 at 07:11:30: I'm tired of only seeing the Divine in flowers and birds -- which are fading from the world. I want to see it in people, in events, in communities, in victories for justice and liberation and love. I want to see the Divine in something that's actually growing and triumphing.

2019-05-16 at 07:11:30: It feels like there all the world's magic has fled somewhere we cannot find it. We need it back. We need signs, miracles, and wonders. We need to see the goodness and beauty of this world actually win something big and important.

2019-05-16 at 07:11:29: Where is that energy now, Godde? Why can't you help us? Why won't you help us? Is it our free will? Fuck our free will, we are dying, physically and spiritually. Is it almost the end time? Hurry up then, there's suffering while you delay.

2019-05-16 at 07:11:29: Where is Godde in all this? I was reading the Quran, Ibrahim, and I was struck by the line about sending Moses and his signs (miracles/wonders). Like, remember when you have signs that you cared about us? Remember when you split the veil of heaven to comfort and save us?

2019-05-16 at 07:11:28: How are we ever, ever going to solve economic inequality? Even starting a revolution seems impossible, making sure it ends with liberation for all and power for the oppressed seems like a damn fairy tale. All these big issues. Feels so hopeless.

2019-05-16 at 07:11:28: And I guess a lot of it is feeling the pain of the Earth? We're ruining the planet, and if abortion is so complicated, how the hell are we gonna talk about climate change? How will we convince people not just to tackle the problem but to protect the most vulnerable?

2019-05-16 at 07:11:28: Idk this is a very loose rant into the void. I'm often writing with an audience in mind but this one's really for me. I just feel very lost. I actually feel better about life on some levels than I have in months. But in some ways I'm more pained than I've been since Nov 2016.

2019-05-16 at 07:11:27: My spiritual side has never felt more repressed and I know *many* spiritual people going through the same thing. Maybe it's the heavens? I wish I knew astrology better. Or shittiness of the world? But so many find more connection then. Idk. That spiritual escape would be great.

2019-05-16 at 07:11:27: My codependent ass just wants to escape into a new romance and/or a TON of kink. A great book/game would be good too but I'm picky and that costs money. Too few escapes are free. Skateboarding helps but I can't do a ton of it because I only have so much leg stamina and daylight.

2019-05-16 at 07:11:26: (stream of consciousness rant)

I'm honestly so sad, scared, and exhausted by the state of the world right now. And I know that means I need to back off Twitter etc rn. But I like being able to escape out of my life and into the stream.

That quote just doesn't seem compelling or accurate enough.

2019-05-16 at 05:43:01: Actually ended up having a really good conversation with a friend of mine who's a cis ally and wanted to know how to be more inclusive in abortion convos. There just aren't great answers.

2019-05-15 at 10:50:00: I also struggle with how to keep pestering people to include trans men in the discussion while also making it clear that this is an attack on women based in sexism. Trans men aren't the target of these laws. But they're caught in the crossfire and they shouldn't be ignored.

2019-05-15 at 08:32:04: Idk maybe it's just a manifestation of unnecessary guilt on my part but solidarity among trans people of all genders is really *really* important to me and to see it elided by her was shocking even though it was actually a fairly understandable mistake.

2019-05-15 at 08:32:03: Seriously didn't want my one random blip of interacting with one of my trans heroes to be calling them out for cisnormative language when in other areas I make that mistake all the time :/

2019-05-15 at 08:26:02: @Lavernecox You're welcome, I am sorry for the call-out, it feels important. But this didn't change the respect and gratitude I have for you and all that you do for the community, and I'm sorry I didn't see a way to ensure you heard me that more clearly demonstrated that. You're wonderful 💜

2019-05-15 at 03:24:30: @snuttastral How can you not care about this then? The language around reproductive justice is way worse for trans men but it affects us too! It doesn't fucking *break* hearing people over and over and over again talking about this and saying things about "all women" that don't apply to us?

2019-05-15 at 03:18:18: @snuttastral Are you trans?

2019-05-14 at 19:27:14: If Republicans want to, like, pad their constituencies by giving coal miners more money than they probably need to move to new jobs, fine. Not great, but we can live with that. Literally. Because if we don't close down these coal plants, WE WILL DIE.

2019-05-14 at 19:27:13: The middle ground could be found in how we *implement* the GND, but the resolution itself basically just says "This is the scale of the problem, the is the scale of the solutions we *need* if we don't want to *die*." There is no compromise with extinction.

2019-05-14 at 19:19:50: @AreUniverse @tdickinson511 @QueerWire @justicedems @AOC Only makes it more ridiculous that Biden wants a middle of the road solution because you're right, it's not a plan.

2019-05-05 at 20:10:08: @transphilosophr I feel like there need to be more memoirs out there. I've thought about writing one myself. I'd hope to see the genre evolve to where trans-ness is an important piece but not the main point. But even so, eggs and trans kids need that representation.

2019-05-05 at 20:06:34: I will vote for the Dem nominee no matter what, but, everyone else seems like more of what I hate about the party, and I won't be happy to vote for most of them -- *especially* Biden.

Bernie's too old and WAY too white, his takes on identity politics suck. I'd still be happy to vote for both

5) Capitalism really, really sucks

2019-03-11 at 19:33:23: Lessons learned:
1) Capitalism sucks
2) Late Capitalism and Amazon's inherently predatory time-off system sucks.
3) Solidarity is amazing, the help we got from fellow-strugglers was amazing and I look forward to the day when we can return that energy.

2019-01-28 at 20:19:35: My enemies aren't the people who feel I'm too radical; that doesn't mean we shouldn't ever get into conflict, but we don't have to banish them from our lives. The line between them and those who just genuinely don't respect my existence can be blurry,

2019-01-28 at 20:19:35: And that reminds me that, even though it feels like being a centrist democrat feels like a dangerous capitulation to oppressive structures in society, that they aren't my real enemy, and that even rural Republicans can be open to genuine dialogue and growth.

2019-01-28 at 20:19:34: It also shows that a community can have a limit on what it can tolerate -- and that tends to be homophobes, racists, and alt-right activists. Their lack of tolerance just flat out isn't tolerated: if you can't be peaceful and mind your own business, you aren't welcome.

2019-01-28 at 20:19:34: There are people like McMurray whose efforts fail (he's a homophobe trying to grapple with the reality that gays are here to stay) but then we also see stuff like the back-alley junkies and the local gay-but-very-conservative pastor dancing together in said alley.

2019-01-28 at 20:19:34: The people of Letterkenny are on the whole pretty conservative (excepts Squirrelly Dan the wokes hick) but they all honestly try and often actually *succeed* to be not just tolerant but even to understand the lives of people very different from them.

2019-01-28 at 20:19:33: Letterkenny is such a wholesome show.

2019-01-24 at 15:07:12: Fwiw, I am not toxic and dangerous. We all have flaws and wounds that can hurt others. Mine are no more harmful. I'm not the greatest friend, lover, or partner, but if you can put up with my shortcomings I can be a damn good one.

2019-01-24 at 14:58:41: I have calmed down but unlike usual I don't exactly regret my Twitter outbursts last night. It wasn't completely rational but it was some great emotional processing.

2019-01-24 at 05:38:59: This thread was actually some useful processing. Thanks for indulging me.

2019-01-24 at 05:38:59: How many times have I inflicted my own wounds onto others? I know I can be a powerful force in people's lives... And then one day I'm just gone. How do I stop doing it without just becoming a hermit? And is this even the result of some repressed trauma, or is this just who I am?

2019-01-24 at 05:38:59: I've been pining for more romance and connection lately, but it feels so selfish, because I know that I'll just take it back someday, drawing myself inward and leaving the usually-codependent people I tend to fall for alone without what I know is a powerful emotional support.

2019-01-24 at 05:38:58: I know that there is a general feeling of abandonment and rejection in this dark mass, and I have definitely mirrored that behavior. Even the ones I haven't fled from permanently, I'll disappear for weeks and then come back like nothing happened -- or worse, brimming with guilt.

2019-01-24 at 05:38:57: I don't know how to tell my story without seeing this trail of people I've let down, hurt, and abandoned. I have ghosted out of so many lives, quite possibly reinflicting some of my buried emotional wounds into others for reasons I can't even get a handle on.

2019-01-24 at 05:38:57: Kinda sorta "I will let you down, I will make you hurt." It just feels like, given enough time, I will *always* bring more pain than love into someone's life. It's hard not to get Ideas when you think like that.

2019-01-24 at 05:38:57: And also my codependent ass focuses a lot on how this psychological state is volatile, confusing, and potentially harmful. It feels like my best choice is solitude, and that every friend, lover, partner is a dangerous concession.

2019-01-24 at 05:38:56: I just... I want it out. I want it ripped out. I want to know what the fuck is living down there and how I can help it heal, understand why it's hurting me so much. Or I just want it gone, ejected from me like something rotten.

2019-01-24 at 05:38:56: And whatever this thing I'm clenched around is, it feels toxic. It makes me feel dangerous and damaging. It makes me want to isolate myself so that I don't hurt the people I love, and so they don't hurt me. It makes me worried to feel deep emotion, because it lives in the depths.

2019-01-24 at 05:38:56: I still want to sob, and I still can't, so I'm venting instead. There is something clenched down so hard, so afraid to let it out, and I feel like it must be a part of this big blank hurt inside me.

2019-01-24 at 05:38:55: I will probably never know what happened to me, or even know that it happened there, or if it even happened at all. My repression skills are top-notch. But, it seems like I see the echoes of it everywhere in the chaotic realm that is my emotional state, and I hate it.

2019-01-24 at 05:38:55: It also doesn't help when I know there are wounds in me that I don't understand. I went down a rabbit-hole doing research on a school that I briefly went to. There was, unsurprisingly to me, a culture there that enabled and covered up abuse (2 known priests, who knows who else?).

2019-01-24 at 04:06:42: It can be really hard to know how exactly to make the pile work. I can get caught in black-and-white thinking: I have a tendency to focus on how I'm holding things, assuming it's something I'm doing wrong. Sometimes I fight that and focus just on the pile. Hard for me to do both.

2019-01-24 at 04:06:41: And sometimes I the pile gets jostled and I'll realize that it had been resting on my arm wrong, straining my wrists. Sometimes things just need rearranging, sometimes I need to put something down, and sometimes I'm just holding it wrong.

2019-01-24 at 04:06:41: Being me often feels like trying to carry too much stuff in my hands, and I keep dropping stuff and having to stop to pick it up, and the pile I'm carrying gets all mixed up and I forget what all's even in there.

2019-01-18 at 04:45:09: All the dorm-room hangouts, all the hotboxing, all the growth, all the music, all the support we gave each other. Late nights in the library, later nights at that house. The three of us were wonderful, and I'll always treasure that.

2019-01-18 at 04:45:09: It's so much harder for them though, honestly, I'd imagine. I'm so glad they have each other. I wish I could give them what they want. I wish I could explain why I can't. But I think I'll just have to be grateful for all the cherished memories.

2019-01-18 at 04:45:07: I want desperately to reconcile, but I'm pretty sure we never will. And that hurts. A lot. And I need to let myself feel that pain rather than running from it, but I also can't let it rule my life. I've got to stop feeling it in drips and drabs, I need to let it out of me.

2019-01-18 at 04:45:06: I'm trying to use music to help loosen my heart. My life has for months been ruled by the sudden, terrible, heartbreaking end of a long, deep, loving friendship -- two actually, I lost a friend in the split.

2018-09-17 at 22:36:08: It's one of those things where inertia is making a bunch of small problems seem big, in part because most of the problems in front of me don't seem like things I can decisively change, either because they're too big or because I don't fully understand how they work.

2018-09-17 at 22:36:05: And I still don't feel as rooted in my new home as I'd like, I feel really out of phase with the flow of energy here and I'm really frustrated at how uncomfortable I feel in most spots in the apartment. It didn't bug me when I didn't live here. Now I miss my personal cocoon.

2018-09-17 at 22:36:05: Basically I just feel like I'm in limbo and waiting for some opportunities to drop and I'm tired of being broke and bored and cooped up. I don't feel like I have a life right now, I feel like I'm just trying to hold out against ossifying into depression.

2018-09-17 at 22:36:03: I'm so frustratedly restless and I still feel unsettled and don't understand my energy at all. Plus I've been taking every other dose of my antidepressants for over a week (refill tomorrow thank Godde) so that's not helping either

2018-08-31 at 20:36:01: I'm really looking forward to having my own life again. This is mostly running away from an untenable situation, but it really helps that I'm leaving it for a great situation with two wonderful women who love and support me.

2018-08-31 at 20:36:00: This has been a very hard decision made very suddenly. While my community loves and supports me, my stepping away is going to be an extra challenge for those still living and volunteering in the House. If you've ever thought about getting involved, now would be a great time.

2018-08-31 at 20:36:00: I'm moving in with my lovely girlfriends Gwyn and Pelle, who have been so supportive of all my efforts to stay afloat and have also been so supportive of my decision to get out of the deep end. As I start a new chapter of my life, I'm glad I get to do it with them and not alone.

2018-04-12 at 15:54:01: @Stravadavadoo Honestly yesterday was super boring, I was confused about why I was so desperate for distraction... I think I was trying to distract myself from myself.

2018-04-10 at 16:21:00: @Poppysgrandkids @MsPackyetti @we_built_this Again, Luke 21:1-4 tells us that the value of a donation is based on your generosity, not on the amount you give. If you give more than I make in a year, that just means you have more than me to give. The widow's one coin was worth more than your entire annual income.

2018-04-10 at 15:05:07: @Poppysgrandkids @MsPackyetti @we_built_this Mt 20:1-16 is literally -- LITERALLY -- about how our reward is based not on our labor but on God's love and generosity for each individual no matter how much work they do.

2018-04-05 at 22:29:27: I'm frustrated. I'm seriously so tired of being broke, I'm sick of it and it stresses me out so much. But I don't currently see a path to stable income, it feels like I'm not working so that Megan can and, like, that's a tough situation.

2018-04-05 at 22:29:26: I'm frustrated. I've felt so much guilt lately and it's really not warranted and it's definitely but helpful to myself or any of the other people I feel I'm letting down. Parts of my life are so great and parts feel so bleak.

2018-04-05 at 22:29:26: I'm frustrated. This weather fucking blows and it's really, really, really messing with my energy levels and has been for weeks. It also makes the fantasy of "maybe I could walk or bike to a job" less tenable.

2018-03-09 at 17:40:32: Hanging out at my dates' apartment is honestly a lot like going on retreat. Except less praying. (Still some calling out for Godde though ;3) A real sanctuary from all the drama of my work.

2018-03-08 at 22:08:28: @GrumpyCatterman I don't have any more emotional energy to spend on this, I just recommend actually listening to some people who *aren't* white and hear *their* ideas for how to best combat white supremacy. I believe in your capability to learn better ideas than the ones you've been peddled.

2018-03-08 at 22:05:12: @GrumpyCatterman You're saying that Martin Luther King, Angela Davis, and their intellectual successors are racists who have fought to keep racism alive and well so that they could continue their careers? Seriously?

2018-03-08 at 21:34:05: @GrumpyCatterman Though I am kind of tickled by the possibility that dozens of academics and activists of color have all conspired to brainwash me in ways that make me more racist.

2018-03-08 at 21:28:16: @GrumpyCatterman Because I choose to trust people of color when they tell me what I can do to be a better antiracist ally. They don't tell me to judge people by their skin color, but they do tell me that ignoring race and racism won't help correct the damage it's done to all of us.

2018-03-08 at 19:45:27: @GrumpyCatterman @TullamoreDEWUS Colorblindness isn't antiracism, it actually perpetuates racism.

2018-03-08 at 19:39:56: @GrumpyCatterman @TullamoreDEWUS I'm not friends with Deray McKessin or Angela Davis or any activists of color with that level of renown, I just respect their intellect and follow their thinking on how I can best be an ally. (Btw they definitely never told me or any white person to use that slur)

2018-03-08 at 19:29:48: @GrumpyCatterman @TullamoreDEWUS Well yes I am but literally all white people have been brainwashed by our society's reinforcement of white supremacy, there is always the danger of taking a paternalistic attitude in dismantling the effects of racism on people of color which is why I try to follow the cues of POC

2018-03-08 at 19:22:54: @GrumpyCatterman @TullamoreDEWUS People of color is the phrase that my black and brown siblings have recommended I use.

2018-03-08 at 19:21:28: @GrumpyCatterman @TullamoreDEWUS Your understanding of history and systems of oppression are fundamentally flawed, white supremacy still stacks the deck in whites' favor in so many ways.

2018-03-08 at 15:21:24: @TullamoreDEWUS You know there are people of color who are actually experiencing racism today because unlike the Irish they haven't been folded into the social construction of whiteness. We could focus on them and their stories? Just a thought. Sincerely, a descendant of the Irish diaspora.

2018-02-20 at 06:04:40: My crush put on facial hair today and O M G H E L P M E

They are hot no matter where on the spectrum they present :3

2018-02-19 at 17:39:21: Anyway, I love her, and I'm grateful for her, and I'm so grateful that she sacrificed our relationship and took on a lot of loneliness and guilt to let me grow. She's given me so much. The Divinity within me recognizes the Divinity within the prophet Megan Felix.

2018-02-19 at 17:39:20: She promised to be there for me through all my changes and growth. And while she hasn't been there romantically, she's been my housemate and co-worker and friend despite all the pain it's brought her, and she facilitated my growth in an incredible way at great cost to her.

2018-02-19 at 17:39:20: I never, ever thought I could forgive her for breaking her vow. Now I want to thank her. Now I see that, even though it's not how I wanted it to look, she didn't break her vow at all.

2018-02-19 at 17:39:19: So yes it hurt me so much, but I'm no longer angry I'm grateful. We're best friends, and now I'm in a place where I'm not friends with her *despite* our divorce, it's actually a part of why I'm grateful for her.

2018-02-19 at 17:39:19: And now because I've had to rely on myself I've found depths of beauty and power that surprise me. I am so proud of who I am right now, if who I'm becoming.

2018-02-19 at 17:39:18: She knew it was what I needed. And she knew I wouldn't see that at first, and might not ever. She knew she might lose one of her best friends. She knew she'd miss our romance and feel guilty for ending it. But she knew we both needed it so she did it anyway.

2018-02-19 at 17:39:18: I don't know how I feel about the romance itself anymore -- whether I miss it or whether it's just a good thing I wouldn't care to revisit. But I know Megan gave up a lot and hurt herself a lot, and while yes it freed her from some of my shit she also loved me when she did it.

2018-02-19 at 17:39:18: Our relationship had problems, but it was beautiful. I'm not grateful for it like she killed some abomination. She hurt herself a lot in the process, and it allowed me to grow in some remarkable ways. If we had stayed together I wouldn't be the amazing woman I'm becoming.

2018-02-19 at 17:39:17: I've gotten to the point where I'm actually grateful that Megan ended our romantic partnership yet still am grateful for what we had. I never thought I'd feel that way.

2010-08-11 at 11:30:41: @connivingcanard At first I thought you were talking about Marco, so I was really confused, lol.

2010-08-11 at 04:01:08: @xofconformity @goosedork @falkonface k :)

2010-08-11 at 03:54:06: And, heck, does anyone else?

2010-08-11 at 03:53:42: @goosedork @xofconformity Do either of you need/want a ride tomorrow or Thursday?

2010-08-11 at 01:54:45: @dylanisnotamyth I liked those parts of the book. And the culture/locale bit. Hell, I mostly liked it. Just hated the writing.

2010-08-11 at 00:23:18: #inmiddleschool I thought that when I got responsibilities, I would always enjoy it.

2010-08-10 at 12:07:41: @jmentalcase ;-)

2010-08-09 at 20:25:48: @goosedork :D

2010-08-08 at 22:15:29: @goosedork I hope that was a poor attempt at a joke.

2010-08-06 at 19:10:51: @xofconformity Just realized that Deevee can evolve into Dumbreon. You probably already knew this, but heh xD

2010-08-06 at 18:54:35: @natsuotoast Grab a brush and put a little makeup.

2010-08-06 at 06:26:14: @damnfan I'm always up for hanging. Just don't be in NoCo until Monday :) I'm glad your Summer's been so amazing : D

2010-08-06 at 06:20:06: You'd better find somebody to love.

2010-08-06 at 06:20:00: Wouldn't you love somebody to love?

2010-08-06 at 06:19:52: Don't you need somebody to love?

2010-08-06 at 06:19:44: Don't you want somebody to love?

2010-08-06 at 06:16:20: @damnfan Worst 67 (and counting) days ever? For me at least: I think so.

2010-08-06 at 06:15:54: @damnfan SAME OMG.

2010-08-06 at 06:07:09: @damnfan Only 67 so far by my count.

2010-08-06 at 05:45:25: @connivingcanard but I want to visit him to give him some confidence. I'm not sure I could avoid sobbing though, so I'm staying home.

2010-08-06 at 05:44:48: @connivingcanard If you visit again, let him know we're all praying for him. I don't want to intrude on what might be his death-bed (cont'd)

2010-08-06 at 04:14:49: RT @xofconformity: @heyitscait they are both better than The Wall!

2010-08-06 at 01:50:21: @xofconformity Same thing happened to me when I called Tori. If you wanna talk, now, tomorrow, in a month, whatever, lemme know.

2010-08-06 at 01:40:44: @connivingcanard . . . hoping for the best, fearing the worst

2010-08-05 at 10:23:32: Who remembers Face from Nickelodeon?

2010-08-04 at 06:41:44: @natsuotoast Btw, according to Tori I'm a really big fruit and really fruity.

2010-08-04 at 06:31:51: @natsuotoast "I like your mom's bananas" sounds like a euphamism.

2010-08-04 at 05:15:26: @theshyretirer @connivingcanard Happy birthdays!

2010-08-03 at 00:16:43: @goosedork The emoness.

2010-08-02 at 23:20:48: @goosedork The only time I feel genuine disdain for you is when you talk like this, silly.

2010-08-02 at 06:08:32: @mariorules25 I've not met Eric either.

2010-08-02 at 03:22:13: @xofconformity You're certainly not having the Summer you'd hoped for. @dylanisnotamyth Agreed. Seniorship + Seeing Friends Everyday :)

2010-08-02 at 02:55:37: God; this Summer has just sucked more and more with each passing day.

2010-08-02 at 00:54:57: @xofconformity And now we're gonna spend the rest of the book waiting for the end of Chapter One. Hate that stuff :/

2010-08-01 at 18:54:35: @dylanisnotamyth False. I am naked somewhere in your house, and I am not mad at you.

2010-08-01 at 17:02:32: @mariorules25 "Dye white girls" -@Coheed -- fix'd

2010-08-01 at 00:34:33: @connivingcanard @goosedork Everyone okay?

2010-07-31 at 20:59:59: @dylanisnotamyth That's really awesome.

2010-07-16 at 05:19:40: And I miss you guys :/ Summer has ended up 0% like I thought it would.

2010-07-16 at 05:09:23: --S-o-m-e-- Most days, I have no idea if I'm doing *anything* right.

2010-07-15 at 18:53:04: Phone not working. AC not working, thus compounding sleep problems. Wanted to get up and run w/ team today. No motivation.

2010-07-14 at 20:19:05: @lemontartsunite D:

2010-07-14 at 16:50:52: I agree w/ @goosedork: it's not the tweeting that upsets me, it's that I wish I could help you not be depressed.

2010-07-14 at 03:37:08: @TheShyRetirer I can't decide whether that's sincere or snarky. I actually think it's both.

2010-07-14 at 03:13:38: A/C hasn't been on for three days. I'm now ready to complain about it.

2010-07-14 at 01:00:00: @lemontartsunite /I/ get bruises on my hips from wearing pants sometimes, and I'm a skinny male!

2010-07-13 at 04:10:52: @mariorules25 Well, I know this might seem simplistic, but how's your diet and exercise regimen been?

2010-07-13 at 02:40:48: @dylanisnotamyth w00t!

2010-07-12 at 23:10:53: @mariorules The Papal residence is at 4562 Varrelmann Ave., right?

2010-07-12 at 23:05:11: @mariorules25 Where's the Papal residence?

2010-07-12 at 06:45:00: @damnfan I know a chick named Rose. . . she's my four-year-old cousin though, so I won't hit that.

2010-07-12 at 06:36:57: @damnfan With whom?

2010-07-12 at 06:23:18: @damnfan No, and I'm starting to get impatient.

2010-07-12 at 06:06:35: Trying to remember everyone with whom you've conversed on a particular topic can be difficult.

2010-07-09 at 05:44:47: Shitty

2010-07-08 at 18:21:50: Slept for 14 hrs. . . this is getting stupid. My sleep cycle is stupid.

2010-06-14 at 03:02:56: @dylanisnotamyth Eating five small/medium meals a day filled with healthiness (including meat, optimally) will make you feel better.

2010-05-30 at 13:08:12: @xofconformity Fergus'll get himself killed this Summer if he doesn't shape up :/

2010-05-30 at 12:54:37: @xofconformity Why are you up this early?? And I probably won't be able to make the party; I wish Zach the best though!

2010-05-30 at 04:56:39: Feeling normal. . . maybe that's good?

2010-05-28 at 21:07:07: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-05-28 at 21:05:49: Whoa! What the fuck did he just do? Not that he'll die that easy. . . Maybe when the fighting stops, I can get some more story? Maybe?

2010-05-28 at 04:15:04: @damnfan We know, Smon. And I agree: I'm just giving you shit. Tell Seamus to go put a dick in his mouth.

2010-05-28 at 04:07:54: @damnfan By that logic the crucifixion was bad; but according to us, it was a pretty Good Friday.

2010-05-28 at 03:36:16: My collection of hayley williams pictures just got created.

2010-05-28 at 02:46:16: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-05-27 at 11:02:26: @mariorules25 Actually that's like the exact time I would've come to visit.

2010-05-27 at 04:35:45: @mariorules25 It's past my bedtime right now, but I might come over for a couple hours in the middle of the day tomorrow, if that's alright.

2010-05-27 at 04:20:09: @mariorules25 O shit, I just remembered that you'd txtd me while I was takin Tor home.

2010-05-27 at 03:44:15: @xofconfomity Now I obviously have no bias even though literally everyone in my family went there, but you should consider Rockhurst ;P jk

2010-05-27 at 03:40:42: @mariorules25 He wants to go to Anti-STL.

2010-05-27 at 03:26:01: My car's gonna cost $900 to install a new timing belt. We've spent $1,300 on my car this month.

2010-05-27 at 03:25:24: @xofconformity My parents are making me get mine :/

2010-05-27 at 03:17:24: @natsuotoast Chemistry REPRESENTIN'!

2010-05-27 at 03:07:27: Is applying NaCl(aq) to an open wound in his lip. Fun :)

2010-05-26 at 04:12:13: @mariorules25 Also why not do all three at the same time?

2010-05-26 at 04:11:58: @mariorules25 I actually want you to pick up your wiener to talk with me.

2010-05-26 at 04:07:14: @mariorules25 I was going to earlier, actually, but then Tori called. I would now, but I'm too damn tired to talk with people.

2010-05-26 at 04:03:26: Today has been so shitty. . . I hope tomorrow's better.

2010-05-26 at 04:03:16: @mariorules25 Thanks :)

2010-05-25 at 03:15:14: @theshyretirer If you think you /should/, then you can.

2010-05-25 at 00:07:44: @xofconformity ARE WE INVITED??????????????

2010-05-24 at 04:27:14: @disaynay LOL nice, I'm flattered :)

2010-05-24 at 04:19:20: @dylanisnotamyth You still up?

2010-05-23 at 06:34:11: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-05-23 at 05:58:53: I feel a real sense of foreboding, like something dark is under the surface of my society and it's gonna surface soon. I hope I can dull it.

2010-05-22 at 21:33:46: @theshyretirer I'll guard you :)

2010-05-22 at 19:25:02: The bassist for Oingo Boingo always reminds me of @dylanisnotamyth

2010-05-22 at 16:42:47: @mariorules25 Even so, it's one of my few distractions, so I'm going to savor it even if Aizen's literally transforming like Cell.

2010-05-22 at 16:15:41: @xofconformity I'm still reading and loving Bleach, but GODAMMIT. He's worse than Freeza at this pt!

2010-05-20 at 22:32:46: @falkonface You don't have the authority to issue an immoral order.

2010-05-20 at 05:18:55: Thanks to @damnfan for allowing me to say this so early in the evening: g'night!

2010-05-20 at 04:16:58: @nicepalpal Is missed by me also.

2010-05-20 at 03:54:37: @disaynay I meant like a quick game of chess for the ride home, but that works too :P

2010-05-20 at 03:52:16: @disaynay But that doesn't mean you can't have a victory tonight ;)

2010-05-20 at 03:46:00: @disaynay Oh you metro'd to the Card's game. Tight. Enjoy the men in their baseball jerseys ;)

2010-05-20 at 03:42:58: @disaynay As in the old white men at the Vatican? Hm. And me, I'm just doin' Physics.

2010-05-20 at 03:40:50: @disaynay Like, wasup?

2010-05-19 at 07:18:37: Life* is kicking my ass.

2010-05-19 at 06:40:08: This webassign is kicking my ass.

2010-05-19 at 05:24:28: @disaynay My phone was off anyway, but if I hadn't been asleep than I would've liked that.

2010-05-19 at 05:17:42: I had a headache when I got home, so I slept 'til 9. Now I'm gonna be up all night!

2010-05-18 at 02:24:01: @dylanisnotamyth He will possess your grades.

2010-05-17 at 21:02:55: Low on light, low on sun, low on food, low on sleep, low on friends, low on cash -- low on life.

2010-05-17 at 08:13:38: @damnfan Oh, okay. You have my prayers instead, then. Glad I could talk; you cheered me up too. G'night!

2010-05-17 at 08:05:40: @damnfan Sorry Simon :( I'll talk to you later. If you're not feeling better after-school tomorrow I'll pay a sick visit, k?

2010-05-17 at 06:58:57: @damnfan Are you up this late because you're depressed also? Is there anything I can do to help? Do you want to call me? Prayers any way.

2010-05-17 at 02:45:03: @dylanisnotamyth That really sucks :(

2010-05-16 at 23:49:58: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-05-16 at 23:49:14: So I feel a little better now that Tor's here. . .

2010-05-16 at 20:27:26: I suddenly feel really down. . .

2010-05-16 at 17:26:54: @xofconformity Forreal though good luck.

2010-05-16 at 17:26:41: @xofconformity That's my favorite game! It's a good thing that you, like me, are a turtle-neck fanatic!

2010-05-15 at 20:29:31: Just to let you know, the parade that wasn't scheduled for this Sunday is canceled.

2010-05-15 at 17:23:40: I was on the same road as @jmentalcase's cabin a few minutes ago :)

2010-05-15 at 03:52:27: @damnfan Either at their own house or in Chicago, mostly.

2010-05-15 at 00:50:12: It's working! #pingpong #pavspopcap

2010-05-15 at 00:39:12: Prayers for Penny Arcade as they take on their rivals in Ping-Poing #pavspopcap

2010-05-14 at 03:11:26: @damnfan I surrender. Well played.

2010-05-14 at 03:08:13: @damnfan Heh; little do you know that I am the Chief Executive Officer of Head Up Asshole, Inc.

2010-05-14 at 02:51:14: @xofconformity I'm good at arrogant. Also, I was exaggerating everything anyway, so I didn't mean it.

2010-05-14 at 02:43:52: @mariorules25 Me and Simon (of all people) -- defend the women. You -- ignore everyone but DV who, of all people, is attacking them :P

2010-05-14 at 02:33:27: @mariorules25 It's really just a "let's watch movies" club, but spun in a way that Rosati's admin. likes it.

2010-05-13 at 22:51:07: RT @church_fathers: "If you believe what you like in the gospels, and reject what you don’t, it's not the gospel you believe, but yourself."

2010-05-13 at 03:45:14: @xofconformity Who is that attractive man in your pic?

2010-05-12 at 03:50:02: @disaynay I just think he'll be pleased if you do anything.

2010-05-12 at 03:41:04: @TheShyRetirer this realization hurts. It will hurt alot more when we are 38.

2010-05-12 at 03:19:17: @spensluh222 Probably because James realized he'd invited @xofconformity

2010-05-12 at 03:13:23: @xofconformity No. . . Maybe he likes you :)

2010-05-12 at 02:55:37: Do we need to wear a jacket tomorrow?

2010-05-12 at 01:32:39: @jmentalcase Yeah that's what I'm doing. Still. . . I just want to senior-out of the year.

2010-05-12 at 00:31:15: Do not want to write this paper.

2010-05-12 at 00:18:28: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-05-11 at 05:45:07: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-05-11 at 05:11:01: Tori's staying at my house for the rest of the week.

2010-05-11 at 05:10:39: @damnfan If I knew, I might agree.

2010-05-10 at 04:49:18: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-05-10 at 04:08:37: Update: 10 full days, 1 Mass day, 1 half-day, 3 exam days left. Work left to do: PH, APExam & Relativity; TH, essay; EN, rdg; HI, paper

2010-05-10 at 04:02:04: ugh my parents are frustrating sometimes. . .

2010-05-10 at 00:14:42: The Prostitute has a hose leaking coolant and the radiator fans aren't working.

2010-05-10 at 00:14:14: @damnfan No, there's no way it could've been her, and even if I were evil, it still wouldn't be worth trying to peg her with that.

2010-05-10 at 00:13:09: Car = broken.

2010-05-08 at 19:59:26: @FalkonFace 11:30pm-8:30am, 10:00am-Noon.

2010-05-08 at 19:29:56: Had an AWESOME night last night! Wish I could've come back afterwards, but still -- I love my friends!

2010-05-07 at 04:37:48: @damnfan you are the superior person. That's why you can take his shit.

2010-05-07 at 04:31:22: @damnfan Yeah, when people are inferior in some manner, their only defense is usually to claim otherwise.

2010-05-07 at 04:27:37: @damnfan Your dad is very rational and fair. /sarcasm

2010-05-07 at 02:46:58: @natsuotaost would that be :D :D :D or TTT___TTT

2010-05-07 at 02:46:30: @dylanisnotamyth Plz keep reading. I promise you the Chaplain's situation gets better (in one way or another. . . read on to find out).

2010-05-07 at 02:21:29: @mariorules25 You're bein mean :P

2010-05-07 at 02:13:14: @mariorules25 This mentality = makes me want to shoot people.

2010-05-07 at 00:39:14: My Legend of Dragoon save file got wiped somehow :(

2010-05-06 at 19:32:29: Had no classes today.

2010-05-06 at 04:25:10: @disaynay Oh yeah, your bro's a different story than your parents.

2010-05-06 at 04:18:39: @disaynay Find you like that.

2010-05-06 at 04:17:44: @disaynay Just let 'em?

2010-05-06 at 03:45:41: @KarlDoofWebster I've been told by my mother (who works for SLU), my counselor, Mr. Curdt, and a coll. adm. counselor that they do.

2010-05-05 at 04:04:19: @KarlDoofWebster That's the most false and terrible advice I've ever heard you give someone. They definitely do pay attention!

2010-05-05 at 01:30:19: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-05-05 at 01:14:11: @xofconformity I'll ask if we have one that would fit a giant. Dad's clothes are more likely to fit you than me.

2010-05-04 at 06:21:50: I don't want to go to sleep, but I don't want to wake up tired.

2010-05-04 at 04:13:17: @jmentalcase Sciuto due tomorrow, Wednesday's meh, Thurs. AP ENGLISH (OH GOD; JESUS HELP ME), then Friday should be good./annoying.

2010-05-04 at 03:37:30: #2010 Weird.

2010-05-03 at 23:34:46: @disaynay That wouldn't be statutory rape, fyi. He has to be older than 21 AND you be younger than 17.

2010-05-03 at 16:15:22: @FalkonFace Weddings + Forced to go to them = Suck. Weddings + Want to go = The Roxorz.

2010-05-03 at 16:14:48: @Jmentalcase Ha, but hey: The tub's one of the safest places to be during a tornado.

2010-05-03 at 16:00:44: Heh, 1st Monday + Lots of Tornadoes recently = AHH!!!

2010-05-02 at 21:40:46: @dylanisnotamyth DV's in KC right now :/ But his house is the one to the right of the house with the Irish flag on it.

2010-05-02 at 05:52:24: @mariorules25 We never get paid back for our good deeds. Look what happened to big J. . . Sorry we missed ya today; at Affton's musical?

2010-05-01 at 19:40:32: @archstl Just out of curiosity, who is the normal tweeter for ArchStl?

2010-05-01 at 19:23:22: @damnfan DAMN, FAN! I've got AT&T.

2010-05-01 at 19:10:01: @xofconformity I wish they'd screw up more often. That was ridiculous.

2010-05-01 at 18:56:28: OMG I just downloaded 1.8MB of data near-instantaneously!

2010-05-01 at 16:30:43: @damnfan That's why I don't normally get haircuts.

2010-05-01 at 04:30:20: @spensluh222 Nvm, Simon's gonna be in Rome on holiday.

2010-05-01 at 04:08:37: @spensluh222 If it's at Simon's, I can get it back to you tomorrow. I'm gonna be down there tomorrow evening.

2010-05-01 at 04:08:04: @KarlDoofWebster True. They still look really dumb, though.

2010-05-01 at 03:51:27: @KarlDoofWebster And yet, our Bible seems to suggest it's already ending too.

2010-05-01 at 03:39:42: Oh my God. Tom DePriest is dating Emma. What the fuck is our world coming to?

2010-05-01 at 03:29:53: I wish I hadn't had to leave. . . now I'm just gonna be alone 'til Tuesday.

2010-04-30 at 04:12:18: Feeling like I'm gonna just cry.

2010-04-30 at 04:07:11: @damnfan Might be the saddest part in the whole book, idk. It's just so damn surprising :(

2010-04-29 at 04:56:07: Wow, something must be wrong w/ me. I was listening to Dogs, and I just stopped it 'cause I thought, "This is just trite and stupid."

2010-04-29 at 04:32:23: @karl You're welcome. Glad I could help.

2010-04-29 at 04:21:12: @Karl I think if you google "Naomi loved Ruth" and look for an appropriate page, you'd find it.

2010-04-29 at 04:20:44: @Karl And there's one other that I found compelling (though I don't find any of these /super/ convincing in themselbes), I forget though

2010-04-29 at 04:19:48: @KarlDoofWebster Jesus and the Centurion (Mt 7,28; 8, 5-13; Lk 7, 1-10). Thethoughtthere is that the greek word "slave" has double meanings.

2010-04-29 at 04:16:31: @KarlDoofWebster Oh those. Um. . . Somwhere in Ruth (Ruth loved Naomi like she did [guy's name]. . . (cont'd)

2010-04-29 at 04:08:27: @KarlDoofWebster I'm flattered, go ahead.

2010-04-29 at 03:54:22: @dylanisnotamyth I know :( This book is really starting to get to me.

2010-04-29 at 02:55:43: @xofconformity Karl would like to express his dissatisfaction at your use of "gay" as a pejorative descriptor. I lightly concur.

2010-04-29 at 01:22:14: @damnfan I was gonna say that. Your reply to @tristasjoy, not your tweet. Idk what's so awesome about next week.

2010-04-29 at 01:13:19: @tristasjoy You expecting?

2010-04-29 at 01:06:55: @TRISTASJOY YES!!! BULLS, HERE I COME

2010-04-27 at 04:58:40: @mariorules25 I love being a #sheep too!

2010-04-27 at 03:53:14: @spensluh222 Hey, instead of buying me Jr. Ring tickets, how about buying me lunch tomorrow? Heh. &gt;_&gt;

2010-04-27 at 03:21:36: @damnfan Penisism*

2010-04-27 at 03:20:31: I've really missed you guys :/

2010-04-27 at 02:56:58: @xofconformity @damnfan I'm rebelling against the healthy norm.

2010-04-27 at 02:45:24: @damnfan YES, I'M A REVOLUTIONIST *DIPDIPDIP*

2010-04-27 at 02:41:16: @xofconformity We would know, right? XP

2010-04-27 at 02:38:40: @xofconformity Me too :) Funny book, sort of eye-opening.

2010-04-26 at 09:11:55: Missing one more day of school. Gonna be super-bored and super-lonely, but I'm just not quite feeling up to it.

2010-04-26 at 07:51:33: Feeling much better! My stomach's still rejecting food, though :/

2010-04-26 at 07:47:54: @mariorules25 I liked CitR :/ And C22 is amazing! Honestly, Idk if I've disliked any of the books we've read for English. . .

2010-04-25 at 04:48:18: @xofconformity Did you mean to mention @falkonface? 'Cause I didn't even do "signif" on purpose.

2010-04-25 at 04:32:36: The only thing I've done in the last 3 days is read, do HW, talk with a priest, some communion-stuff, play #LegendOfDragoon. Nothing signif.

2010-04-25 at 04:29:03: @xofconformity Me too. It's a real treat when we do interact, though.

2010-04-25 at 03:16:11: @xofconformity LOL. Yeah, that's one of the reaons I don't liike Webassign.

2010-04-25 at 03:11:53: @jmentalcase @dylanlouis I wish I could visit you and Ryan. I hope we're all doing better soon.

2010-04-25 at 03:10:57: @xofconformity I posted it on Tumblr and on a Tweet that @mentioned you, lol. Put "700." Then it reads the right # of sig-figs.

2010-04-25 at 03:08:18: @jmentalcase EEK!

2010-04-25 at 03:08:00: @xofconformity @damnfan On Tumblr. He put "700" instead of "700."

2010-04-25 at 02:58:25: @falkonface That's a really good score independent of how I did.

2010-04-25 at 02:51:43: @falkonface That's really fuckin' awesome! That's a fantastic score, congratulations!

2010-04-25 at 02:49:57: @falkonface I'm probably not going to anyway. What was your score?

2010-04-24 at 21:51:32: @tristasjoy the #tornadoalerms are fun. It stopped pouring as much up here just now.

2010-04-24 at 17:42:54: @karldoofwebster I didn't even know you'd gotten sick!

2010-04-24 at 17:13:49: Maybe /all/ my friends is an exaggeration. . . still feel bad for @dylanisnotamyth

2010-04-24 at 17:13:15: @damnfan I mean, are you guys sure you're feeling okay? 'Cause I could've had strep for a week, I could've spread it anytime this week.

2010-04-24 at 17:12:35: @jmentalcase Oh. . . What's up with you, dude? @damnfan That's also good, yeah.

2010-04-24 at 16:47:10: @jmentalcase DAMMIT, now I feel like a huge asshole. I'm getting all my friends sick -- stupid, of course that's not allergies! :(

2010-04-24 at 04:19:10: Hope he sees anyone tomorrow. . . not going to Certamen :/

2010-04-24 at 04:05:58: @disaynay What were you talking about with me and @jmentalcase?

2010-04-24 at 02:22:09: @disaynay ?

2010-04-24 at 01:55:43: @damnfan LOL

2010-04-24 at 00:29:40: @damnfan He brought me Communion.  And thank you Mr P! I'm trying; feeling a little better :) Thank all of you for being good caring friends

2010-04-24 at 00:23:00: @dylanisnotamyth I've been super-bored and feeling super-dirty today. Sick=Suck. I'd come visit you if I weren't sick too.

2010-04-24 at 00:18:38: Fr. Houser came to my house, we chatted for an hour and a half. Very productive; what a holy man. He's being transferred to Rome in July :(

2010-04-23 at 23:58:22: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-04-23 at 20:30:23: @dylanisnotamyth Same: better, kinda. My eye looks a lot better now that I went and got some medicine from my doctor.

2010-04-23 at 20:14:34: @dylanisnotamyth How are you feeling?

2010-04-23 at 19:37:13: Very bored, slightly lonely. Wishing I could actually see (pinkeye=me-contacts). Waiting for my one visitor of the day. Praying for Mr. King

2010-04-23 at 13:28:32: Does anyone have a tape-to-digital converter?

2010-04-23 at 12:14:00: @mariorules25 I'd go if I weren't sick. But I since I am, my mom took my car to work, so I couldn't drive down there.

2010-04-23 at 12:12:08: @dylanisnotamyth O____T

2010-04-23 at 05:20:04: @mariorules25 I only assumed it was Willie because we're in Theo. together and we just got done watching a video that ended with that query

2010-04-23 at 04:34:37: @dylanisnotamyth I am planning on going down to SoCi for Mass again this Saturday, though. So if not tomorrow, maybe ghosts then?

2010-04-23 at 04:26:37: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-04-23 at 04:00:54: @disaynay I really am kind of sick though :/ I'd love to hang out in the South -- I want to live in the South, really. Alas. . .

2010-04-23 at 03:51:01: @dylanisnotamyth Though you probably have some idea of how much I'd love to hang out.

2010-04-23 at 03:50:42: @dylanisnotamyth Even if I get better, my mom's stealing my car and I'm not going to school tomorrow.

2010-04-22 at 23:22:14: @jmentalcase YES. We will film excellence on that camera, including the first full-body apparition on camera!

2010-04-22 at 22:51:02: Teenagers are stuck in a constant state of comfortability.

2010-04-22 at 22:42:18: RT @dylanisnotamyth I hate being at home [(especially when I'm sick)]

2010-04-22 at 22:18:16: @dylanlouis Okay. I'm really sorry if I got you sick though. I'm not the only one who could've given it to you, but still &gt;_&gt;

2010-04-22 at 22:03:13: Just a warning (@dylanlouis): I went home sick today. I probably have strep throat and pink eye. Be alert; it's spreading, you could have it

2010-04-21 at 09:06:44: Please pray for me, guys.

2010-04-21 at 05:42:24: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-04-20 at 04:34:04: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-04-20 at 04:33:27: They should call the next game "KH 358 Days", because "KH (358/2) 2"="KH 358."

2010-04-19 at 05:31:32: @TheShyRetirer OH, okay. /ego=deflated, but that's a good thing so don't apologize.

2010-04-19 at 05:24:52: @falkonface I'm sorry I missed you on FB; I had to go talk to Ma & Pa.

2010-04-19 at 05:23:30: @theshyretirer You just liked a post of mine from February!

2010-04-19 at 05:18:33: @theshyretirer Hey, I'm being stalked apparently xD

2010-04-19 at 04:52:13: @theshyretirer :)

2010-04-19 at 04:47:38: @theshyretirer I believe in a thing called love.

2010-04-19 at 04:02:20: @dylanisnotamyth Luciana?

2010-04-18 at 17:05:47: @LT_TheBIblegeek That's why you go to *Jesus's* house every morning and he makes you breakfast.

2010-04-18 at 04:53:44: @dylanisnotamyth would it help if I told you Ce$ha were naked in your house somewhere?

2010-04-17 at 18:26:15: Just saw Ronald McDonald.

2010-04-16 at 05:42:58: Had forgotten to switch his overhead fan from Winter "circulate warm air" mode to Summer "blow cold air" mode. Fix'd.

2010-04-16 at 05:09:30: @falkonface So like, Mustangs and disco and rainbows and peace signs and JFK all the time at your house, because of your sister?

2010-04-16 at 05:01:55: @falkonface We're used to it being a lot colder at night, in part.

2010-04-16 at 04:42:01: Saddest moment in C22 so far, imo, coming up tomorrow for you guys. No one dies or anything; it's small, but I found it really sad.

2010-04-16 at 02:09:28: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-04-16 at 01:47:41: @dylanisnotamyth It is a plan.

2010-04-16 at 01:47:12: @xofconformity I agree that that's more important; I don't think it has to come first. Just in general removing reasons to want to have one.

2010-04-16 at 01:25:51: Not saying I agree with the reasoning of RvW, just saying what the underlying logic suggests.

2010-04-16 at 01:25:12: @xofconformity Itt should be legal for the same reason abortion currently is: a right to privacy and choice as found in the 14th amendment.

2010-04-16 at 01:13:35: I need to know if anyone needs/wants me or my car tomorrow. In short: is anything going on?

2010-04-15 at 04:27:56: @dylanisnotamyth I'm a day ahead of you; it took me a lot of last night, before HR, HR, and a lot of my free period to read that section.

2010-04-14 at 04:29:15: @FalkonFace Me too. I was like, 2. Scared the /shit/ out of my parents, 'cause my normal temp is like 96, so +9 over normal. . . O_O

2010-04-14 at 04:06:58: My body temp. is 2degrees (98.2) above normal, I have a cough, and I feel really tired even though I slept for 5hrs. after I got home :/

2010-04-14 at 03:54:05: I will keep trying. He wants me to, and I enjoy it, even though I know I won't succeed.

2010-04-14 at 02:22:05: @disaynay couldn't* care less

2010-04-13 at 05:36:00: @carolimerose She pretty much summed up my favorite parts.

2010-04-13 at 04:10:42: @FalkonFace With, but that's not scored with the rest of it, is it? I *know* it's not with the SAT.

2010-04-13 at 04:08:47: @damnfan Switch your topic sentences. Done.

2010-04-13 at 03:59:36: @carolimerose ACT:33/36, SAT:2100/2400 (the scores are about equal)

2010-04-13 at 03:55:29: I don't think I'm going to take the ACT or SAT again. I'm happy w/ my scores.

2010-04-13 at 03:24:37: @damnfan I can't decide whether to ._. , &gt;_&gt;, T_T, or ;D

2010-04-09 at 04:03:39: @TheShyRetirer Yay.

2010-04-09 at 03:50:05: @TheShyRetirer okay :/

2010-04-09 at 03:20:40: @dylanisnotamyth LOL, best joke ever.

2010-04-09 at 00:20:42: @jmentalcase OOOH!!!

2010-04-08 at 05:01:53: @TheShyRetirer Cool. We'll talk more on Friday.

2010-04-08 at 04:53:26: @TheShyRetirer the only extra drive would be the one in the morning, and that's not too big a deal, no.

2010-04-08 at 04:46:31: @TheShyRetirer So it's no problem for me if you want.

2010-04-08 at 04:44:55: @TheShyRetirer I have a working oven. And, as I mentioned, not only am I going to your picnic, but also to a Liturgy in SoCi, (cont'd)

2010-04-08 at 04:06:56: Caritas, Intergritas. . . better yet: amare, tenere.  Our principles will strangle us.

2010-04-08 at 03:50:25: @mariorules25 I always like to remember that whenever Elise is tweeting a 80tps, I can just say, "off disanya."

2010-04-08 at 02:21:42: @jmentalcase :(

2010-04-07 at 05:18:43: When you stay up at late at night, stuck in your own head unable to get it, do you think of me? I need to think of you more. Ur great help.

2010-04-06 at 04:19:54: @jmentalcase &gt;___&lt;

2010-04-06 at 04:19:41: @damnfan ;_;

2010-04-06 at 04:08:07: @jmentalcase Post or it didn't happen.

2010-04-06 at 03:43:48: Za-chary*

2010-04-06 at 03:43:38: She's Zach-ary's age.

2010-04-06 at 03:43:22: Anyone have a copy of FFVII they'd be willing to loan my sister? I'd take full responsibility if she broke it.

2010-04-06 at 02:32:56: @dylanisnotamyth D: *hug*

2010-04-06 at 01:29:26: @dylanisnotamyth Thanks :)

2010-04-06 at 01:23:08: @dylanisnotamyth what's the old schedule?

2010-04-06 at 00:39:16: @tristasjoy NOW I'll lol

2010-04-06 at 00:33:41: @mariorules25 I'd lol if I weren't often guilty of the same thing.

2010-04-06 at 00:04:02: @xofconformity sudo chown -hR [username] [path directory to external]

2010-04-05 at 23:58:40: @xofconformity Idk if that'll fix your problem, but that's the one you want.

2010-04-05 at 23:58:24: @xofconformity ext3

2010-04-05 at 23:50:46: @xofconformity OH JESUS D: My friend, you may have the ride you request. Spring Break + No Car = OMG :(

2010-04-05 at 23:35:27: @xofconformity Max &/or Simon to the rescue?

2010-04-05 at 22:26:34: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-04-05 at 20:59:33: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rHaVUjjH3EI&feature=player_embedded Funny video about Leviticus from "The West Wing."

2010-04-05 at 20:41:44: Props to Rocco Palmo at whispersintheloggia.blogspot.com; arguably the best reporting on Catholicism period. #catholicnews

2010-04-05 at 06:09:43: No more thunder :(

2010-04-05 at 06:03:26: @nicepalpal School resumes on Tuesday.

2010-04-05 at 05:53:48: @disanya @falkonface @lalarnia @theshyretirer Ladies and gentlemen, I salute you.

2010-04-05 at 05:48:35: ROLL CALL! Who's still up?

2010-04-05 at 05:21:54: THAT ONE WAS BRIGHT, DAMN

2010-04-05 at 05:20:00: @spensluh222 Us three should get together right now and do awesomeness. . . The fact that it's midnight precludes that option, though.

2010-04-05 at 05:19:00: Me too :/ RT @dylanisnotamyth I cant sleep because i'm too busy mind fucking myself and listening to the storm.

2010-04-05 at 04:13:42: Dammit, why do I have to choose? Church or Children hardly seems like a real dichotomy. If only I were Orthodox :/

2010-04-05 at 04:13:05: @dylanisnotamyth I live for thunderstorms. It's my favorite thing about Spring.

2010-04-05 at 04:08:18: THUNDERSTORM'S ROLLING INTO NOCO FTW

2010-04-05 at 03:07:55: SLUH STUDENTS HEADS-UP: SPECIAL SCHEDULE TUESDAY, NO ACTIVITY PERIOD. Something about a Drugs Panel. . . anyway, there it is.

2010-04-05 at 00:49:23: Lotr is on at the Ritzy Dq. There is no way in which this is not the Bible.

2010-04-04 at 22:11:05: @xofconformity These were my exact jealous thoughts, only I was a little more jealous because he went camping with my BFF. Still,all good :P

2010-04-04 at 20:29:10: Happy Easter! Feliz Paschua! Felix Pascha!

2010-04-04 at 06:46:20: @damnfan I'm glad you've enjoyed it :) You made the beginning of break pretty cool.

2010-04-04 at 06:27:36: @dylanisnotamyth I've been looking forward to school since last Friday.

2010-04-03 at 17:01:16: SHOWER TIME

2010-04-03 at 15:05:44: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-04-03 at 14:50:59: @LT_TheBibleGeek It's hard to stay subdued when you know what's happening tonight :)

2010-04-03 at 06:43:28: @mariorules25 Trufax; I need you in my life right now. RIGHT NOW!

2010-04-03 at 06:43:07: RT @dylanisnotamyth: I'm soooo worthless at helping. I wish i could.

2010-04-03 at 06:29:31: @dylanisnotamyth @mariorules25 I wasn't looking forward to break at all. I want it to be over.

2010-04-03 at 04:27:31: Coolest name for an apostrophe: The comma in the sky.

2010-04-03 at 04:21:54: @dylanisnotamyth Lent ended yesterday, in case you didn't know. #randomthoughts

2010-04-03 at 03:49:20: @lalarnia AND JUST DO IT

2010-04-03 at 02:18:06: @theshyretirer Well then that's when we'll get you. We're gonna have to take you home around 18:45. . .

2010-04-02 at 23:07:42: @theshyretirer Well okay: What's the earliest you'd be willing to go? I'll work backwards from there.

2010-04-02 at 22:54:50: @theshyretirer What time should we grab you tomorrow?

2010-04-02 at 06:02:00: @disyana @damnfan @mariorules25 Enjoy yourselves :)

2010-04-02 at 05:47:26: @damnfan Very nice. Hope the walk home doesn't suck too bad.

2010-04-02 at 05:42:52: Weird, cool day. Triduum is easier in KC -- it's like going on retreat then.

2010-04-01 at 08:28:28: @mariorules25 I'm beginning to think it's just part of existing. You know that no one really *gets* you.

2010-04-01 at 07:58:35: Can't. sleep. Ugh.

2010-04-01 at 05:57:46: @damnfan We're all annoying. I like you anyway, though :)

2010-03-31 at 17:58:11: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-03-31 at 16:31:25: @jmentalcase Congrats!

2010-03-31 at 08:30:13: Things are unusually quiet at the normally bustling time of 3:30am.

2010-03-31 at 06:54:26: Well, I'm not planning on going to bed now.

2010-03-31 at 04:52:12: Bed time. Approximately.

2010-03-31 at 04:43:13: @jmentalcase Looking at your stuff is weird cause I'm always looking for a deep meaning, but sometimes I feel like I'm interpreting "Walrus"

2010-03-31 at 04:42:18: @jmentalcase I think the picture of the lady looks very nice. Also, I lol'd at the Camera-man.

2010-03-31 at 04:41:27: @lemontartsunite My music theory = shit.

2010-03-31 at 04:02:36: Ask me anything http://formspring.me/watersm

2010-03-31 at 01:13:20: "How many days have I lost?" Well, today was pretty worthless, apart from Mass and the movie "Proof."

2010-03-30 at 03:46:09: @dylanlouisisnotamyth I lied to you: being at your house was totally in the plan. I wanted to surprise you; I wanted to see ya. Thanks :)

2010-03-30 at 01:33:03: @MaxWaters I lied. I just happened to somehow magically play that with the album version perfectly in synch, and they're the same speed.

2010-03-30 at 01:28:24: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ztFbhM5caw My favorite bass line to play right now. The album version is about half a BPS faster.

2010-03-30 at 00:45:13: @dylanlouisisnotamyth I showed up in your yard!

2010-03-30 at 00:06:59: @dylanlouisisnotamyth I traveled about 22.3 miles by bike today.

2010-03-29 at 23:57:30: @dylanlouisisnotamyth I got home a-okay.

2010-03-29 at 22:15:31: @dylanlouisisnotamyth I'd probably kill Jessi. Just because.

2010-03-29 at 22:13:03: Being DL's parents = impossible task.

2010-03-29 at 21:16:48: Just biked/walked from my house to @dylanlouisisnotamyth's. Let me in?

2010-03-29 at 21:10:37: Hanley and St. Anthony is in sight.

2010-03-29 at 20:54:58: Getting close to Hanley and 270

2010-03-29 at 20:12:57: Made a wrong turn down Hanley.... Been heading South, not North.

2010-03-29 at 00:33:03: @mariorules25 @tristasjoy Aw God, they're all qwinks!

2010-03-29 at 00:12:11: @tristasjoy For Lent. Which is funny 'cause he's definitely not a practicing Catholic.

2010-03-29 at 00:03:54: @tristasjoy My dad might be the coolest person in existence.

2010-03-29 at 00:00:20: @tristasjoy My dad's shares a birthday with Albert Einstein and Al Capone.

2010-03-29 at 00:00:03: @disanya One of the best states of being.

2010-03-28 at 17:52:18: You've got to be dead to be bigger than life, but everyone's afraid to fly; everyone wants to be on a postage stamp, nobody wants to die.

2010-03-28 at 17:48:04: @damnfan All hail the mighty Primate of Music!

2010-03-28 at 17:45:54: @damnfan @disanya :P

2010-03-28 at 17:45:29: @mariorules25 Alright, you had a really good point yesterday about us and our opinions on music. We are pretty obnoxious.

2010-03-28 at 07:45:53: @disanya Olives? Where did that come from?

2010-03-28 at 07:27:32: @disanya I'm glad! I try :) When my friends are smiling, I'm a little happier. It's a selfish selfless act of kindness, making y'all smile.

2010-03-28 at 07:20:35: @disanya Jk :P

2010-03-28 at 07:20:26: @disanya Slut

2010-03-28 at 03:31:57: @dylanisnotamyth Try reading some of the books about him.

2010-03-28 at 01:26:21: Fell asleep like 4 hours after he woke up and slept until now :/

2010-03-27 at 21:34:25: I want to wake up tomorrow and have it be Thursday so that this whole long week could be behind me :/

2010-03-25 at 03:12:42: Deus meus, Deus meus, quare dereliquisti me?

2010-03-25 at 02:50:42: Hates the burden. . . Ignorance is bliss, but mine is conquerable.

2010-03-24 at 22:18:36: I'm so lonely and bored :/ Reading about God makes me want to be with other people &gt;_&gt;

2010-03-24 at 22:11:05: @damnfan I wish I was more like the Weekenders sometimes.

2010-03-24 at 18:47:17: @xofconformity I wish we could all help each other and ourselves. I also wish we didn't have to.

2010-03-24 at 03:34:21: "Today, I realized that the word WOW looks like a golf ball stuck in grass. MLIA "

2010-03-22 at 04:18:35: @tristasjoy And I'm sure they have their own perception of colors in some fashion. Just like deaf people can understand sound vocabulary.

2010-03-21 at 17:37:06: Pokémon, gotta catch 'em all.

2010-03-21 at 17:28:47: @disanya Says the one who probably has her shoes.

2010-03-21 at 17:21:14: Who has Mrs. Nguyen's shoes?

2010-03-21 at 06:22:35: @spenSLUH222 do you even know how appropriate that is?

2010-03-21 at 06:18:46: I support @dylanlouisisnotamyth and @mariorules25. Go team! Stick it to her!

2010-03-19 at 02:52:09: Is done with Webassign. Now to the rest of it.

2010-03-19 at 02:30:02: @disanya False. The master of meditation -- or prayer, or any mental discipline -- can do it anywhere. It can at least be helpful.

2010-03-19 at 02:25:36: At this rate, I'm going to be up for literally a bajillion hours.

2010-03-19 at 00:29:48: @spensluh222 No. I won't listen to you.

2010-03-18 at 00:12:18: @xofconformity Your mother angers me sometimes. Quite often, lately.

2010-03-18 at 00:02:43: @xofconformity @spensluh22 The woman, @disanya, got it.

2010-03-17 at 22:40:18: Needs someone to pick him up.

2010-03-17 at 03:08:23: Is gonna be up /late/. Damn.

2010-03-17 at 01:04:35: @jmentalcase Dammit I wish I'd worked on Sciuto at all before now.

2010-03-17 at 01:01:05: @disanya @tristasjoy Yeah, lol; I just @'d Tyou since you'd been talking about it. Doing too many things at once xP

2010-03-17 at 00:50:11: @dylanisnotamyth Maybe @tristasjoy would like to help make it better?

2010-03-17 at 00:13:18: @tristasjoy Hawt. You should read it at my local library. The kids would love it.

2010-03-16 at 23:56:37: @Tristasjoy LOL

2010-03-15 at 19:50:54: Bored. Lonely. Not looking forward to the rest of the day :/

2010-03-14 at 04:56:28: LAST WARNING: Our picnic is CANCELED due to inclement weather. Please don't show up in NoCo tomorrow en masse. Thank you, and sorry guys :(

2010-03-13 at 22:47:50: Picnic cancelled! :-( please check FB inboxes for more info. Sorry everyone.

2010-03-13 at 04:00:55: RT @reapteam "Mass is not [just some] obligation;it's an opportunity."

2010-03-13 at 00:36:03: Has anyone seen a black jacket that says "Godfather's" on the back?

2010-03-13 at 00:25:09: @raspberryplaty You know, you were more fun before you started getting wasted all the time.

2010-03-12 at 23:41:43: @disanya Aw, thanks :) That makes me feel better, knowing that someone thinks about me. I'll try and stop being so gloomy, then!

2010-03-12 at 23:15:13: Bored. Lonely. :(

2010-03-11 at 04:18:38: @spensluh222 Likewise! I think there's a lot I've misunderstood about you, bro. Really overlooking a lot of potential awesomeness :)

2010-03-11 at 03:56:36: Ready to play Prison Sex?

2010-03-11 at 03:49:14: @disanya Lol

2010-03-11 at 03:38:13: @reapteam As in only put food-stuffs in it, not can of soda, box of cereal, broken computer, etc.

2010-03-10 at 04:20:19: Maybe one of these days I can straighten this shit out. . . Thank God for Laetere Sunday. . . but I need Easter, stat.

2010-03-06 at 19:18:54: @spensluh222 I hate Christian Pop too! It ruins. . . well, everything it touches, basically.

2010-03-06 at 04:21:58: (cont'd) who could be Tor and I's boy.

2010-03-06 at 04:21:44: I swear to you, in my Theology book (p107) there's a picture of a guy dressed in my clothes who looks like me, walking with a child (cont'd)

2010-03-04 at 04:02:56: I hate being alone.

2010-03-03 at 05:30:21: Man, I don't like being up this late.

2010-03-03 at 02:45:38: @natsuotoast /d/!!!????

2010-03-03 at 00:29:21: @disanya :) Take heart, Elise. The rough times will pass.

2010-03-02 at 04:15:48: @mariorules25 LOL

2010-03-02 at 04:03:37: @dylanisnotamyth I wish I could be gay for you, Dylan.

2010-02-27 at 01:55:27: Perusing liturgical norms FTW

2010-02-26 at 05:06:47: Done with that. Thank God. Damn you SLUH; the administration has taken so much from me.

2010-02-26 at 05:03:01: @damnfan @tristasjoy I'm sorry, don't worry about me. I'm just overly attached and insanely emotional sometimes.

2010-02-26 at 05:00:37: I feel like I"m going to vomit.

2010-02-26 at 04:13:12: @damnfan No need for ";_;" I'm all good :D

2010-02-26 at 04:09:00: @damnfan Okay, I do beat up on myself a bit. But hubris and hypocrisy are certainly part of my character. Sometimes that's good, often bad.

2010-02-26 at 04:02:33: @lemontartsunite Bad Catholic? Nah. At least you're not a hypocritical, pretentious ass (like me). Those are the guys that piss Jesus off.

2010-02-26 at 03:39:35: @damnfan Roger that :)

2010-02-26 at 03:36:36: @falkonface Black trench coat or black leather jacket?

2010-02-26 at 02:21:30: @spensluh222 It's supposed to kind of suck xD Thanks for being conscientious for we mackarel-snappers!

2010-02-26 at 00:04:15: @falkonface Deal

2010-02-25 at 05:04:51: @disanya loaded-gun* complex

2010-02-25 at 03:03:19: RT @reapteam on tonight's retreat Gretchen asked everyone, "Is prayer your steering wheel, or is it your spare tire?" #reapteam

2010-02-24 at 05:10:06: @TristasJoy FACT (IMO)

2010-02-24 at 04:50:18: @jmentalcase I really don't know who's going. Not many people can afford it/hotels/gas. I know Rachel, I think Cait. . .

2010-02-24 at 02:44:32: @spensluh222 Yeah, no one can go to ACEN this year D:

2010-02-24 at 01:13:39: @xofconformity Yes, and reapplied to some places I'd already visited during my last job-hunting stints. Mostly, though, I'm ineligible.

2010-02-23 at 23:49:29: @xofconformity DAMMIT GETTING JOBS IS IMPOSSIBLE!!!! /rage

2010-02-22 at 04:31:25: @damnfan Sorry we left so much stuff at your house ._.

2010-02-22 at 04:11:07: @maxwaters Applies to txting, also.

2010-02-22 at 04:10:37: RT @damnfan i sometimes wonder why people never start conversations with me online then i rememberthatidon'trespondandi'mnotpleasanttotalkto

2010-02-22 at 03:57:47: @disanya I do that to people sometimes, but I feel bad :/

2010-02-21 at 05:57:19: @TristasJoy Well, on behalf of faith-filled Christians everywhere, I apologize that we're treating you poorly. I wish I could help :/

2010-02-21 at 05:45:14: @TristasJoy That's a shame. Forcing faith on someone is sinful: it makes you less likely to ever /choose/ to believe. I'm sorry ;_;

2010-02-21 at 05:02:56: @TristasJoy Right, but I know that if you were in a Catholic church, your pastor literally /couldn't/ confirm you because you don't believe.

2010-02-21 at 04:47:30: @TristasJoy And that's silly; I saw Lutherans marching in albs at the last gay pride parade!

2010-02-21 at 04:47:05: @TristasJoy Damn, I was hoping I could give you some advice, but I don't know enough about Lutheranism.

2010-02-21 at 04:41:36: @TristasJoy That really sucks, and I completely agree: it should be your choice :( Is this a Catholic church?

2010-02-21 at 04:31:52: @TristasJoy Or is it that you don't want to be forced to go?

2010-02-21 at 04:31:33: @TristasJoy Is it the church or the being with family that sucks more?

2010-02-20 at 03:57:21: @lemontartsunite FALSEHOOD!!!!!!!!!!!! (I typed each exclamation pt. individually, fyi.)

2010-02-20 at 01:18:42: I cried because I miss being a concert bassist.... But I'm not that connected to my sis either.

2010-02-20 at 01:00:08: Cried during my sis's concert yesterday. Now we're talking music...

2010-02-15 at 04:54:10: @Jmentalcase LOL :) There's actually a chance (like 1%) that we could get a snow day on Tuesday.

2010-02-15 at 04:49:12: @Jmentalcase Snow is gettin' a bit much. . . fun stuff!

2010-02-14 at 06:39:37: @dylanlouis still trying to decide what to give up. . . Hookers?

2010-02-14 at 05:08:35: @FalkonFace My GF does that to me sometimes.

2010-02-12 at 02:26:19: @Jmentalcase YAY!!

2010-02-11 at 05:03:35: @damnfan If you want to talk, gimme a call.

2010-02-11 at 04:02:13: @FalkonFace n=number of times you can give up before actually giving up. n&gt;9,000

2010-02-11 at 04:01:47: @lemontartsunite I PROMISE YOU THAT YOU EXIST.

2010-02-10 at 04:13:37: I know you care, some very much. It's just getting harder to feel with every passing day.

2010-02-10 at 01:36:01: @disanya Well that is better :)

2010-02-10 at 01:24:22: @disanya Anger. It's awesome!

2010-02-09 at 05:09:50: @damnfan Gotcha :)

2010-02-09 at 05:05:08: @damnfan I meant if school is canceled.

2010-02-09 at 04:50:29: @damnfan Same, lol. Afterschool OR around 2:00pm?

2010-02-09 at 04:31:31: @damnfan Webassign party tomorrow? THIS IS HARD!

2010-02-08 at 06:33:25: wishes he weren't alone right now.

2010-02-08 at 05:49:23: @lalarnia @falkonface YOU CAN DO IT! I BELIEVE IN YOU!

2010-02-07 at 23:33:22: @spensluh222 I know that wasn't directed toward me :)

2010-02-07 at 23:33:06: @spensluh222 I'm trying :)

2010-02-06 at 04:54:03: @TristasJoy Ok, so you and your debacle over Diablor or Unreal Tournament has made you my new favorite person whom I've never met :D

2010-02-05 at 04:13:25: @disanya Parents suck. I actually love my parents, but I still can't wait to get out of this house.

2010-02-04 at 06:09:33: I don't want to be awake right now. Seriously, seriously, I do not.

2010-02-01 at 23:14:11: @disanya My Adv. Geo. class last year was taught by someone who taught us stuff /way/ ahead of what we should've been learning.

2010-02-01 at 23:12:20: @disanya Specifically those quizzes, giving the trigonometric values of special angles and stuff.

2010-02-01 at 23:09:47: @disanya That same sort of thing happened to me in Geometry last year.

2010-02-01 at 05:45:21: @FalkonFace even if*

2010-02-01 at 05:44:41: @FalkonFace Tuesday, but like I'm not gonna have much time on Monday even I get no other homework.

2010-02-01 at 04:33:44: Fuck you English. I don't want to find another quote that I find insightful. . . I just want to go to bed.

2010-01-31 at 08:34:44: @disanya You're playing PJ Sam right now? We should have a Pajama Sam party!

2010-01-31 at 03:50:10: @raspberryplaty I mis-spoke earlier. I'm not really even leaving the house til ten.

2010-01-29 at 04:35:57: It took me forever to get writing. I've been trying since I got home, and I /just/ got something down.

2010-01-29 at 03:13:38: Attempts at writing: 0-3 ._.

2010-01-29 at 00:39:14: @damnfan Mom has made it clear that, while we couldn't afford it long-term, refugees are always welcome at our house.

2010-01-28 at 05:31:22: @dylanlouis I hate this too. We have the same stuff as you do, and I just decided I wasn't going to do all of it. It's really hard :/

2010-01-28 at 03:49:31: Obama had a lot of stuff to say. . . let's see how much of that gets done, and what happens, but... cautious optimism. #stateoftheunion

2010-01-25 at 03:25:01: @KarlDoofWebster Hahaha. I think everyone had that phase, but for most people this ended a long time ago.

2010-01-24 at 21:05:26: @TristaJoy I'm not even sure that I've ever met you, but that sucks :( I hope something radical happens and you have a good b-day anyway!

2010-01-19 at 20:53:18: @damnfan Maybe. I just heard that DL called to ask what time it was in America, so that seems to imply he at least /was/ not in America.

2010-01-19 at 20:50:51: @damnfan I actually think DL's in Canada, but Idk what's up with Mike.

2010-01-19 at 20:40:55: @damnfan So they're not letting me leave 'til I'm done. . . which could take awhile.

2010-01-19 at 20:40:41: @damnfan but DV decided he's not coming over, and I haven't heard anything from Mike or DL.

2010-01-19 at 20:39:45: @damnfan My only excuse to my parents for stopping my preparations (mostly laundry) for my trip tomorrow was that I was giving rides.

2010-01-19 at 16:34:03: @xofconformity Call me when you wanna head down there.

2010-01-18 at 18:39:11: @XofConformity @dylanlouis You need a ref/ride/other friend?

2009-12-19 at 20:59:28: @xofconformity I have remembered that I an picking you up

2009-12-19 at 06:46:15: @SeamusHAMILTON I didn't know you had a twitter!

2009-12-19 at 06:45:29: @thisblows Right on!

2009-12-19 at 06:22:26: I've got a feeling that tonight has been a good night.

2009-12-18 at 21:08:08: Free!

2009-12-18 at 07:33:32: @spensluh222 That's understandable. Shame though; he's a good guy, sucks that he needs help.

2009-12-18 at 07:20:49: @HeyItsCait he he he :P

2009-12-18 at 00:31:37: @TheShyRetirer He he he. . . whether I had any hand in it or not: :D

2009-12-17 at 21:56:30: One more thing to do this week.

2009-12-17 at 20:04:18: Getting off early is awesome. The sun is out!

2009-12-17 at 04:14:20: @xofconformity If by "the talk," you mean "bitch slap that hoe 'til she can barely breathe," then go for it.

2009-12-17 at 00:07:57: @x yes, me course :-)

2009-12-16 at 22:52:12: Really hungry

2009-12-16 at 22:44:58: @dylanlouis aw, now you guys can jam IN THE CAR!!!

2009-12-15 at 04:57:16: G'night :D (Haven't done that in awhile -- don't get used to it)

2009-12-15 at 04:56:55: @RaspberryPlaty Steve, you don't believe that. Quit lying.

2009-12-15 at 04:04:02: @connivingconnard Lol, I was watching an 8th-grade choir, " orchestra, and " band, and they were terrible, even for 8th graders.

2009-12-15 at 02:33:45: This is painful...

2009-12-14 at 06:44:06: @damnfan I know my opinion probably doesn't count for much, but I'd rather you not.

2009-12-14 at 00:27:22: Anyone want to join me for Wash U Mass? I understand it's short notice, sorry.

2009-12-13 at 05:18:54: Tony likes two Floyd albums: Piper and Ummagumma. That pretty much sums up everything /I/ need to know.

2009-12-11 at 23:11:27: Watching a whole bunch of sophomores playing Brawl.

2009-12-11 at 04:28:09: Paper=Done

2009-12-11 at 03:38:13: @lemontartsunite It's okay if you're angry sometimes :) I'm glad that you're beginning to simmer down though, because you'll be happier now

2009-12-10 at 23:31:38: Alright, almost done. Going to head home now.

2009-12-10 at 22:02:25: Paper writing is awesome :-)

2009-12-10 at 06:18:17: @meaVictoria HAPPY BIRTHDAY! I love you very much; thanks for coming into life and then coming into my life &lt;3

2009-12-10 at 05:35:28: feels odd. It's very late.

2009-12-10 at 02:19:02: @Damnfan nice

2009-12-10 at 01:13:09: I'm listening to Coach talk. What about you?

2009-12-09 at 23:02:00: And now, wait.

2009-12-09 at 04:19:16: @connivingcanard Just remember that an aid is not the same as a solution.

2009-12-09 at 04:01:16: @RaspberryPlaty I certainly have those days when I realize I haven't really been awake :/

2009-12-08 at 22:32:07: At school, chilling. Hungry :-(

2009-12-08 at 04:57:02: Too hyped up from panic attack earlier. Can't sleep :\

2009-12-08 at 04:42:15: @RaspberryPlaty That is probably the worst feeling in the world, forreal.

2009-12-08 at 02:45:22: And have been since about 4:00pm, when we realized that. . . Seamus was at SLUH!

2009-12-08 at 02:44:59: @alostbeauty I'm pretty damn sure I am.

2009-12-08 at 01:23:59: @carolimerose I think the showering and drinking part sounds like at least an okay time :)

2009-12-08 at 01:01:54: http://zs1.smbc-comics.com/comics/20091207.gif

2009-12-07 at 23:16:05: I verbalized it, finally. I'm just trying to figure out who my friends are.

2009-12-07 at 22:35:52: @raspberryplaty Can I make you impressed instead? I'll play you sweet music.

2009-12-07 at 22:31:39: @alostbeauty isn't Seamus from DeSmet such a loser?

2009-12-07 at 01:12:19: @KarlDoofWebster In order to have the draft done a week early, it needs to have already been done; it's due this Friday.

2009-12-07 at 00:57:20: @TheShyRetirer You should, then :) Sleep well, I hope you wake up refreshed.

2009-12-07 at 00:45:27: @xofconformity I agree. @alostbeauty Would probably hate Steve.

2009-12-06 at 22:05:19: @xofconformity You actually don't need a comma there.

2009-12-06 at 21:31:27: @xofconformity I thought there wasn't a difference?

2009-12-06 at 05:57:04: @alostbeauty Beauty is when what one sees, one loves.

2009-12-06 at 05:51:36: @alostbeauty But what if it was a wonderful day because @heyitscait murdered 20 beautiful people?

2009-12-06 at 05:36:49: @alostbeauty What is beauty, sir?

2009-12-06 at 05:28:35: @alostbeauty I didn't mean Chrome, I meant  Kateikyoushi Hitman Reborn!

2009-12-06 at 05:23:49: @alostbeauty And I know that @jmentalcase doesn't /appear/ to follow ~shuui

2009-12-06 at 05:23:27: @alostbeauty Well, I know you read Chrome and follow/are ~shuui on DA.

2009-12-06 at 05:22:44: @jmentalcase "Internet is real life!"

2009-12-06 at 04:49:02: I want @alostbeauty to be someone we don't know. So badly.

2009-12-06 at 03:58:28: OMG! I'm following Marilyn Monroe: @alostbeauty The most under-rated beauty of the last century!

2009-12-06 at 03:57:28: @alostbeauty and I mean that nicely, lol. Sorry :(

2009-12-06 at 03:56:43: @alostbeauty Who the Hell are you?

2009-12-05 at 21:01:56: @jmentalcase Hey, right on!

2009-12-05 at 16:45:51: time to bathe, get dressed, then hw.

2009-12-05 at 01:35:36: @xofconformity HOLY SHIT!!!!

2009-12-05 at 01:15:47: wishes that my closest friends ever wanted to hang out with me. I can't blame them for being busy, I guess. . . I know I'm busy, too.

2009-12-04 at 23:35:55: When I text people to talk, only my sister answers. :-(

2009-12-04 at 21:39:27: @dylanlouis Hey where you at dog?

2009-12-04 at 03:36:17: @damnfan BAM

2009-12-04 at 03:36:04: Who wants to come to my house tomorrow? I'd like some company.

2009-12-04 at 03:34:29: @damnfan @xofconformity LOL

2009-12-04 at 01:59:23: @connivingcanard Voss also proposes the difference in economy bases might have gotten severe enough.

2009-12-04 at 01:51:13: @xofconformity Well I know it wasn't /just/ slavery, but do *you* think there was any one issue that comes close, 'cause I don't, but idk.

2009-12-04 at 01:44:51: Hey @xofconformity , I have a question, since you wrote a paper about it: Do you think slaver was the chief cause of the Civil War?

2009-12-03 at 04:41:11: My dad knows me so well; it's awesome.

2009-12-03 at 04:39:45: The most impoverished class of all: Those who have founded their own fetters, albeit of gold and silver.

2009-12-03 at 04:34:56: "Most of the luxuries, and many of the so called comforts of life, are not only dispensable, but positive hindrances to the elevation of man

2009-12-03 at 04:29:23: "So thoroughly and sincerely are we compelled to live, reverencing our life, and denying the possibility of change."

2009-12-03 at 04:26:46: "could a greater miracle take place than for us to look through each other's eyes for an instant?"

2009-12-03 at 03:59:46: @xofconformity If that were true, my life would be much less enjoyable :(

2009-12-02 at 04:22:32: "Keep us safe, Lord, while we are awake, and guard us as we sleep, so that we can keep watch with Christ and rest in peace." G'night!

2009-12-02 at 04:21:49: @damnfan I think it's depressingly ironic that she cares this much.

2009-12-02 at 04:19:16: @xofconformity @disanya I'm not so big on the self-destruction (though I'm not as confident as I seem), but I am a huge hypocrite x3

2009-12-02 at 03:56:41: Good day. The SLU Pius XII Library is AWESOME, OMG :D

2009-12-02 at 03:46:59: @disanya Plus exercise helps too. :D I'm glad /you/ know how that not eating will make you fat.

2009-12-02 at 03:46:18: @disanya Eating a sizable breakfast and 3-4 mid-sized meals, tapering off toward the end of the day, maximizes your metabolism: burn cals :)

2009-12-02 at 03:35:55: before you go to bed tonight, make sure you say a prayer (or meditate, or offer an oblation, whatever) for those with AIDS. #worldaidsday

2009-12-01 at 06:00:16: Well this is late. And it'll probably be another long-haul day tomorrow. And Wed.

2009-11-30 at 03:06:45: @jmentalcase It might be cool to try, while keeping to the spirit of randomness, using it to force our eyes toward details -- unless you do.

2009-11-30 at 03:06:03: @Jmentalcase Well, it certainly means that no matter where my eyes drift I'm going to be looking I'll be entertained.

2009-11-30 at 02:56:28: @jmentalcase I really like the birds. I think the way you speckle your backgrounds is pretty awesome too. Adds a layer of nuance.

2009-11-30 at 01:37:05: @damnfan Naw, just more massive. It'd be cooler if they were still the same size but had that much mass.

2009-11-30 at 01:28:31: @damnfan Is awesome.

2009-11-29 at 23:44:24: really wish I could find Carter's Playboy interview.

2009-11-29 at 23:39:34: letting my mind drift a bit. . . I need to work more, though.

2009-11-29 at 21:09:16: There was a protest outside the Basillica, because of Carlson giving money to ME. *YAY* for the protest. *CRAP* for being a Catholic here.

2009-11-29 at 21:07:49: @jmentalcase "This Is It" is about /you/, isn't it? Seriously though, that's really awesome.

2009-11-27 at 17:53:52: @theshyretirer Ok, I give up, hahahaha.

2009-11-27 at 17:48:39: @theshyretirer Jane Austin?!

2009-11-27 at 17:46:02: @theshyretirer It's ok, everyone goes through a phase where they really like Agatha Christie.

2009-11-27 at 15:44:00: @theshyretirer It'd be cool to come see you today, but I have to go to Illinois at noon.

2009-11-27 at 15:43:15: I'd love to

2009-11-27 at 15:31:44: Anxiety's getting worse... We're gonna have to bust after this.

2009-11-27 at 15:19:43: @theshyretirer Oh yeah...

2009-11-27 at 15:15:18: @theshyretirer cause it's nine on a Saturday. That,s where I *should* be.

2009-11-27 at 15:10:23: @theshyretirer In bed.

2009-11-27 at 15:04:28: Was enjoying the flash mob, but now I'm beginning to cascade into a panic attack.

2009-11-27 at 13:19:11: Wake up, DAMNIT

2009-11-27 at 12:52:57: @jmentalcase come outside.

2009-11-27 at 12:24:53: @dylanlouis wait, should I not come get you, DL?

2009-11-27 at 12:22:59: Out the door!

2009-11-27 at 12:21:08: Damn this is early in the morning.

2009-11-27 at 06:54:39: @dylanlouis direct message me if you're up.

2009-11-27 at 06:08:10: @jmentalcase make them all polo

2009-11-27 at 05:06:52: @heyitsCait did you fix your 360?

2009-11-27 at 00:28:15: Just had an awesome #thanksgiving dinner at Holy Trinity.

2009-11-26 at 20:48:16: Happy thanksgiving, guys!

2009-11-26 at 20:48:04: @XofCOnformity I love Ham, hahaha.

2009-11-26 at 05:59:20: Je vous en prie.

2009-11-26 at 02:14:54: Tori's on tokyopop, and we saw the digimon manga - awwww yeah, get digi-jacked.

2009-11-25 at 22:13:18: back! Had an awesome time!

2009-11-23 at 04:37:31: One day of school, then retreat. I'll be prayin' for y'all; will y'all please pray for me?

2009-11-23 at 04:03:04: @dylanlouis Seriously though, I love you very much, and I am blessed to have such an energetic bro; you always make my day brighter: be :D

2009-11-23 at 03:55:45: @dylanlouis I love you man. I don't deserve you either. COnsider it a mutual gift -- like sex! (awww yeah)

2009-11-23 at 03:55:19: @dylan and you're helping me with my grammar a lot, too *

2009-11-23 at 03:55:07: @dylanlouis and your helping me with my grammar alot, two.

2009-11-23 at 02:38:27: @disanya @xofconformity Basses are awesome things to have. (Especially classical ones D: )

2009-11-22 at 23:38:26: Today's been a really lazy day - and I've still found a way to keep myself too busy to enjoy it.

2009-11-22 at 18:30:51: @ConnivingCanard *prayers* I hope you recover quickly and fully.

2009-11-21 at 21:01:03: Tori is making creepy Sims...

2009-11-21 at 20:39:17: Tori's playing the Sims as I look on.

2009-11-21 at 05:38:20: I'm seriously considering cutting my hair.

2009-11-21 at 05:27:59: fell asleep around like 7, so now I'm gonna be up for awhile :(

2009-11-21 at 00:52:59: Screw it. As of right now, I'm not even going.This is ridiculous. We chose a place;why are NoCo denizens always the ones who have to travel?

2009-11-20 at 22:19:34: Watching Mulan

2009-11-20 at 04:51:04: @damnfan You trolling + Steve = :D D:

2009-11-20 at 03:33:13: had a good day :) Little HW tonight, then bed.

2009-11-19 at 04:45:22: @dylanlouis I AM NAKED IN YOUR COUNTY SOMEWHERE

All the efforts, sweat, and broken hearts, the screaming and the tears" Change

2009-11-16 at 03:37:55: is glad his grandparents will be in town for a few days :D

2009-11-15 at 15:04:49: it's about time for Mass. Grandparents are comin' in this afternoon.

2009-11-14 at 20:08:39: @HeyItsCait I spent about a half-minute trying to figure out what a "beer hug" was, hahaha.

2009-11-14 at 06:32:06: @disanya Lady Liquor, I'd imagine.

2009-11-13 at 21:42:25: @natsuotoast Waiting for your boyfriend to finish work grant...

2009-11-13 at 05:10:47: is really hoping for some life this weekend.

2009-11-13 at 04:40:55: is having a good time. Up way too late :(

2009-11-12 at 04:00:47: @damnfan you could have just divided by 4, then 9.

2009-11-12 at 03:55:53: @damnfan I'll give you a hint: You only have to do one operation, and it's a simple number.

2009-11-12 at 03:53:23: I'm saying that your answer is totally wrong, hahaha. The correct answer is somewhere around 1,000 (10e3)

2009-11-12 at 03:48:11: @damnfan You mean, like, 15e10? Yeah; it's around 1,000.

2009-11-12 at 03:33:30: @damnfan Really? Oh, well wait: I at least knew that "electromagnetic friction" is slowing us down. Why else?

2009-11-12 at 03:17:09: @damnfan Scratch that, I'm done :D

2009-11-12 at 03:13:15: @damnfan I love you, Simon. On a side note, I only have #8 left to do on Webassign.

2009-11-12 at 00:41:47: @damnfan Ha, I actually follow her and read several tweets of hers yesterday. . . *is an idiot*

2009-11-12 at 00:37:06: @damnfan It says that page doesn't exist. . .

2009-11-12 at 00:35:12: @xofconformity What's her twitter-name?

2009-11-12 at 00:22:30: @xofconformity I thought you said she /got/ a Tumblr, so I was doubly surprised to find out that Cait now had Tumblr and Twitter!! But no :(

2009-11-11 at 23:51:35: @spensluh222 I'll be your secretary if you want :)

2009-11-11 at 04:03:29: @natsuotoast That is my most common "listen to to go to sleep" music &lt;3

2009-11-11 at 01:37:26: "Don't give me a rabies?" "I said don't give me your rabies" ". . . A-rabian nights, like A-rabian days. . ." -- I &lt;3 Tori and Me.

2009-11-11 at 00:24:15: likes/dislikes having responsibilities. . .

2009-11-09 at 03:17:12: @xofconformity I'm listening to Shake Your Tail Feather from the Bad Boys II soundtrack. How about you? How about you? HOW ABOUT YOU?

2009-11-09 at 03:11:36: is listening to EI -- Nelly. Y'all?

2009-11-09 at 00:46:35: About to go on a walk, if anyone's interested.

2009-11-08 at 19:39:33: @Jmentalcase . . . ^^

2009-11-08 at 17:39:10: @xofconformity WIN

2009-11-08 at 06:57:48: Dear best friend: I wish I knew who you are, or if you even really exist. Did you die? Were you ever born? Do you miss me? Love - Max

2009-11-07 at 19:19:54: @natsuotoast go for it

2009-11-07 at 16:17:45: About to give my talk. Pray for me and/or wish me luck, please :-)

2009-11-07 at 04:32:22: Ended up having a good day. And day one is always the worst; the rest will be awesome.

2009-11-07 at 00:41:18: Is in a really bad mood for no particular reason and it's not a good way to be for a retreat.

2009-11-06 at 02:44:59: @xofconformity Yeah.

2009-11-06 at 02:35:49: @Damnfan Well, that doesn't matter, but I'm wearing XC stuff anyway.

2009-11-06 at 02:31:29: @xofconformity Awesome. You get the tweet about your phone?

2009-11-06 at 02:28:52: @lemontartsunite I'd rather lift you up.

2009-11-06 at 02:28:09: Is it a dress-down day today?

2009-11-06 at 00:27:20: @xofconformity Mr. Kesterson found your phone. It was in the announcements, he just didn't remember that it was your phone.

2009-11-05 at 04:21:04: @xofconformity Now you'll know what your mom feels like when I come to visit.

2009-11-05 at 04:14:48: @disanya "lololol" looks like three cannons getting ready to shoot.

2009-11-05 at 04:12:39: @damnfan @xofconformity BAM

2009-11-04 at 23:16:07: Anyone ever been up to St. Vincent Park in Normandy?

2009-11-04 at 22:31:37: Does anyone remember how to dream?

2009-11-04 at 12:58:19: Have good days :-)

2009-11-03 at 23:51:47: @disanya NICE

2009-11-02 at 05:23:59: G'night!

2009-11-02 at 04:59:02: @damnfan Not the ideal, but whatever works :)

2009-11-02 at 04:56:26: @dylanlouis Tell your aunt that she owes me 27cents in royalties.

2009-11-02 at 04:53:16: @disanya @dylanlouis Absolutely! I can also use those to write, masturbate, turn keys, shift gears. . . they are muy importante!

2009-11-02 at 04:47:24: @dylanlouis I'd keep my right thumb, right index, and right middle finger, so that I could still dip.

2009-11-02 at 04:30:54: has his week's agenda ready.

2009-11-01 at 03:46:13: Tori is so ridiculous, hahaha. We'll be back soon.

2009-10-27 at 03:35:22: is about to go to bed. G'night :D

2009-10-27 at 02:49:58: @Dylanlouis I think my record is probably 6 weeks, not gonna lie. That happened over this summer, not gonna lie.

2009-10-26 at 02:29:29: @TheShyRetirer It's all good.

2009-10-26 at 02:24:10: @TheShyRetirer See, that tweet is unfair because I want to ask, but that tweet is implicitly exhorting me not to.

2009-10-26 at 00:39:07: @xofconformity If I gave you something to give to Ham, would you?

2009-10-25 at 21:23:48: Is about to head to the teen center.

2009-10-24 at 21:30:33: @Jmentalcase You'll be alright, I hope :D

2009-10-24 at 20:57:35: Now has contacts

2009-10-24 at 17:50:51: was reading through an old Latin missal, only to discover that the English translation is horribly wrong.

2009-10-24 at 01:18:01: Mom is mad at me because we haven't gotten the glasses that got broken replaced yet.

2009-10-23 at 22:03:34: @natsuotoast Whoa Ham! That is inappropriate! Don't rape @Dylan!

2009-10-23 at 21:53:26: Hot chocolate is awesome!

2009-10-23 at 20:55:32: No longer has glasses; the other leg broke off too.

2009-10-23 at 02:24:53: LETS GO DESTROY OUR MINDS, GUYS :D

2009-10-22 at 04:17:12: Really doesn't want to go to bed, but also has exams tomorrow. . . stupid life -- seriously. *grumble grumble*

2009-10-20 at 03:19:32: God I've been exhausted lately.

2009-10-19 at 00:37:11: "Jesus is more important than hw." "Yeah, but Jesus isn't due tomorrow." "YOU DON'T KNOW THAT."

2009-10-19 at 00:35:11: Nvm. Staying up here.

2009-10-19 at 00:11:26: Good meeting. Gonna head home.

2009-10-18 at 21:16:27: English homework left, then maybe some physics. Luke 18 meeting soon.

2009-10-18 at 19:49:58: @jmentalcase Aren't we all?

2009-10-17 at 20:39:06: Meet was a success! A SLUH victory (except Varsity, our 4/5th Varsity, who took 9th). I placed 5th on our JV team, and medaled 24th overall.

2009-10-17 at 11:55:13: Good morning everyone stupid enough to not turn twitter off! Bout to drive to Washington, MO.

2009-10-17 at 00:47:51: RT @ZachWeiner: at 5:15 pm PST, for one hour, eBay / PayPal / WhatGives will donate $1 PER TWEET. Use #eBay and #beatcancer together!!

2009-10-16 at 03:48:16: Too tired for further work. Bedtime. G'night!

2009-10-16 at 00:13:43: Tired + Homework = FML

2009-10-15 at 04:37:12: Is exhausted past the point of really being able to get any work done, and so is going to bed. G'night!

2009-10-15 at 03:38:42: Homework. . . Ugh. . .

2009-10-15 at 01:32:46: And now we're listening to BreeBree... Help!

2009-10-15 at 01:30:49: @dylanlouis My bad.

2009-10-15 at 01:27:34: Listening to Starstruck... Ugh, Tori, lol.

2009-10-15 at 00:19:46: @nick_aiello What for?

2009-10-14 at 23:55:39: @Damnfan Uso +Ugo = Us + Ug

2009-10-14 at 23:51:06: Homework... When my girlfriend's over... And she wonders why I feel like such a jerk sometimes.

2009-10-14 at 21:40:10: @dylanlouis would it help you if I told you I was naked somewhere in your house?

2009-10-14 at 20:44:33: Hmm... I should probably see my girlfriend soon.

2009-10-14 at 20:39:36: @xofconformity It's because he's Asian.

2009-10-14 at 20:02:19: Is broing out at Dylan's with Simon.

2009-10-14 at 01:10:19: Had a great race today. Now, relax, a little homework.

2009-10-14 at 01:09:43: @dylanlouis YOU ARE MY HERO

2009-10-13 at 03:57:09: Listening to "Foreclosure of a Dream" and doing Webassign.

2009-10-13 at 02:27:54: Had a good time at Gregorian Chant! Homework time :(

2009-10-12 at 04:05:43: @ZachWeiner You made it a private video :(

2009-10-12 at 04:00:19: //The ultimate humbling is realizing that no matter how much I love you, you'll have to die someday.

2009-10-11 at 22:55:20: Long week; long weekend. Looks like a long week coming up... I can do this, right?

2009-10-11 at 11:26:26: @XofConformity I could ask you the same thing! When I called, the only person there besides Simon was Seamus, so we decided to stay.

2009-10-10 at 19:59:57: Simon's later :D

2009-10-10 at 19:57:13: @Peaches1x I'd hate to have to mow a whole farm. . .

2009-10-10 at 19:56:26: @lemontartsunite Like

2009-10-10 at 06:07:24: @TheShyRetirer I wouldn't expect anything less XP

2009-10-10 at 06:03:39: @TheShyRetirer Why do you ask?

2009-10-10 at 05:52:57: Awesome night! Gonna be bored tomorrow, though. Hope I see some of ya.

2009-10-10 at 05:50:55: @theshyretirer It'd be cool if she weren't an 8th grader. . . but that's just a bit creepy.

2009-10-09 at 02:25:51: I have ridiculously awesome friends.

2009-10-08 at 19:22:55: Didn't have much homework, and now I got out early for an orthodontist appointment! Then no practice, so life is complete!

2009-10-08 at 11:29:57: Today's gonna be a good day, I can feel it.

2009-10-08 at 04:39:58: is about to sleep :3

2009-10-08 at 04:01:03: Make lunch, shave, shower, bed-time.

2009-10-08 at 03:32:39: @XofConformity "Just Another Day" by Oingo Boingo

2009-10-08 at 03:03:02: is really dirty and tired and wants to go to bed, but still has lots o' homework.

2009-10-06 at 11:45:59: Lovely weather this morning! Waiting for Rachel to pick me up.

2009-10-05 at 03:40:49: Had a good, if long, day.

2009-10-05 at 03:40:11: @lemontartsunite It's a full moon tonight. At least according to my astronomy-crazy Tori.

2009-10-04 at 14:31:44: Off to Mass, then PSAT-prep.

2009-10-04 at 05:25:30: @TheShyRetirer Me too. As for me, I'm headin' for bed.

2009-10-04 at 05:14:56: @dylanlouis Glad you're having a good evening, lol :P

2009-10-04 at 01:24:55: Just reorganized his phone address book. I'm cool.

2009-10-03 at 23:43:29: Is being surrounded by horny couples, but Tori and I are chill... Fun...

2009-10-03 at 23:39:07: @Damnfan He'd better go with Cait. It'd make @meavictoria happy.

2009-10-03 at 23:36:40: @Damnfan Who'd Mike go with?

2009-10-03 at 23:11:16: Ritenour kids have drama too, but they get it solved in twenty minutes, lol.

2009-10-03 at 22:19:36: At another Ritenour pow-wow. Have fun at your homecomings, everyone :-)

2009-10-03 at 17:40:32: So yesterday, Tori chugged a can of Monster and crushed it in between her boobs. I have found a soulmate, haven't I?

2009-10-03 at 02:06:23: @DV But I'll answer everytime :P

2009-10-03 at 02:06:06: @XofConformity Haven't even gotten through "Dogs" yet, lol.

2009-10-03 at 01:51:46: I, Dylan, am listening to the album _Animals_, by Pink Floyd.

2009-10-03 at 00:28:27: Is gonna be stuck all by himself tonight doing homework. . .

2009-10-03 at 00:28:15: 19:55, placed in the high thirties out of over two-hundred :D

2009-10-02 at 18:18:00: is gonna get ready, eat, then go. I just realized this course is a lot like Sioux; I'd better do well today, then.

2009-10-02 at 15:35:51: isn't at school -- very yes! Race in 7 hours.

2009-10-02 at 02:48:13: realized today that a several of the weaknesses he sees in others are really just projections of his own. . .

2009-10-01 at 02:50:28: @Jmentalcase I mean just like a quick sketch before HR or during AP.

2009-10-01 at 02:28:18: @jmentalcase Mr. Steingruby told us to make our homework a work of art. Can I have your help?

2009-10-01 at 00:39:44: is stoked about life!

2009-09-30 at 04:36:10: G'night!

2009-09-30 at 03:55:02: @MeaVictoria well I've sent you a fair amount, and I've gotten none back.

2009-09-30 at 03:52:00: @MeaVictoria are you getting my texts?

2009-09-30 at 03:34:37: @carolimerose The religious marriage, and esp. the Catholic sacrament of matrimony, looks a lot different, but has those underlying themes.

2009-09-30 at 03:34:03: @carolimerose It's not just religious. It's a promise to always *stay with* and love a person. Not necessarily monogamous, but binding.

2009-09-30 at 01:55:28: Is already done with Webassign!

2009-09-30 at 01:54:59: It's not a surprise. I told him I'd have one made, lol.

2009-09-30 at 01:45:23: @MeaVictoria I see :D

2009-09-30 at 01:28:03: @spensluh222 Well, she loves his old hair, pretty much.

2009-09-30 at 01:27:43: @MeaVictoria Austin Winn? As in, the guy whose pillow you'll be making once you recover? How'd you see him?

2009-09-29 at 03:24:46: G'night (?) !

2009-09-29 at 02:44:13: @ConnivingCanard I sit up in the Martyr's Chapel at one of the desks on the outside.

2009-09-29 at 01:31:19: Bout to head home.

2009-09-29 at 01:04:44: At SLUH doing homework still...

2009-09-28 at 04:58:48: really, really shouldn't have put off all his homework.

2009-09-28 at 03:40:14: got to go to Mass after all! Mom and I went, had a good time :D

2009-09-28 at 03:39:22: @ConnivingCanard Your life has some meaning. If nothing else, it made my life a little cooler.

2009-09-28 at 00:46:53: Dad's car broke down, and they need to borrow mine to fix it, so now I have no means by which to get to Mass.

2009-09-27 at 23:27:24: is doing homework and wishing Tori wasn't sick and being whiny and down and --  I NEED MASS.

2009-09-27 at 23:26:59: @carolime Awesome use of "whom!" I'm proud of you, English major!

2009-09-27 at 15:56:52: is gonna go running soon.

2009-09-27 at 15:50:55: @XofConformity I think your source just misheard. I mean, why would anyone have a desire to make that lie?

2009-09-27 at 15:38:47: Hm. . . I think someone either misheard a story, or is trying to spread rumors, which is ridiculous. @xofconformity

2009-09-27 at 07:26:18: @TheShyRetirer I take my "thank-you's" in smiles, :D

2009-09-27 at 07:10:00: @TheShyRetirer Consider it a gift, then.

2009-09-27 at 07:06:28: @TheShyRetirer You're actually pretty cool, and surprisingly insightful, and can use your selfishness in the least selfish ways possible.

2009-09-27 at 06:11:06: @CarolimeRose Haha, about earlier? No, that wasn't about you :P

2009-09-27 at 06:08:06: @meavictoria That's very awesome! I love you.

2009-09-27 at 06:06:37: @dylanlouis SLEEP, LOL

2009-09-27 at 04:45:49: Had a good night, mostly. Things are going just the way I thought, pretty much. A few suprises.

2009-09-27 at 03:39:20: Oratory is definately a charism, a gift from the Holy Spirit.

2009-09-27 at 02:45:08: Someone wants attention.... Oh well, at least she's doing better.

2009-09-27 at 01:50:07: Rachel's knitting, Ham's dancing, and we're waiting for Connor to get here to watch Lost in Translation.

2009-09-27 at 01:23:06: American Beauty was actually pretty good. Most are out getting another movie, us few are watching Ham DDR.

2009-09-26 at 23:15:23: At Olivia's, bout to go on a soda run with Rachel.

2009-09-26 at 22:48:54: Driving to Olivia's staring at the rainbow.

2009-09-26 at 22:48:25: @spenSLUH222 @xofconformity Dylan got me into LOG by showing me that video, lol.

2009-09-26 at 22:08:50: So, we don't seem to have any items on the agenda. Any suggestions or complaints for the Councili?

2009-09-26 at 22:03:40: NoCo council.

2009-09-26 at 19:14:36: Even if I gave you my whole life, I couldn't give you the attention you need... But I still have to try, don't I?

2009-09-26 at 18:01:48: @heyitsCait in bed?

2009-09-26 at 17:06:27: Watching Scrubs and DL playing Mario.

2009-09-26 at 08:30:47: It's really late...

2009-09-26 at 06:42:46: @natsuotoast G'night

2009-09-26 at 06:38:04: Is talking about rail with Mike and Voss.

2009-09-26 at 05:52:22: @natsuotoast if we both got peg legs, we could be pirate metal-heads!

2009-09-26 at 05:45:32: I beat Dylan to a tweet!

2009-09-26 at 03:57:02: To Dylan's!

2009-09-26 at 02:50:50: @MeaVictoria Hopeful that what?

2009-09-26 at 02:29:07: @spensluh222 Except in bed O_o

2009-09-26 at 02:25:42: knows someone who appears to going insane, but doesn't want me to help.

2009-09-26 at 02:23:51: @spensluh222 Do you really think you could notice the almighty, ever-hidden, ever-present DL-sensei?

2009-09-26 at 01:49:39: had a good race! Waiting for DV or Mike to call me.

2009-09-24 at 03:38:17: has spent approximately 7.66 hours on homework alone today.

2009-09-24 at 02:48:29: @TheShyRetirer Very true. Just ask my aunts ;)

2009-09-24 at 02:37:54: @TheShyRetirer Lol :P Incest is icky, hahaha.

2009-09-24 at 02:24:21: @TheShyRetirer It's just wasabi. Not a big deal, seriously.

2009-09-24 at 01:24:31: @MeaVictoria AWESOME!!!!

2009-09-24 at 00:11:38: Is about to head home.

2009-09-22 at 02:59:13: wants to walk with you all into the darkest depths and the highest heights and all the places in between.

2009-09-22 at 02:52:11: @lemontartsunite If good, then I can help you :)

2009-09-22 at 02:51:50: @lemontartsunite You have several, though none close by. How good a grasp does your heart have?

2009-09-22 at 02:34:24: @MeaVictoria you too dear! Sweet dreams! Grandma says hi!

2009-09-22 at 02:30:52: @Jmentalcase Nice

2009-09-22 at 02:10:47: @MeaVictoria Fuck Zachary Quinto

2009-09-20 at 04:58:41: @meavictoria I wish so too :(

2009-09-20 at 04:56:26: @xofconformity Why does my phone never show me your tweets? It's very annoying :(

2009-09-20 at 00:43:26: It didn't rain! Just sittin' in the garage, waiting for some action.

2009-09-19 at 22:33:28: Is at the Holy Trinity fair, praying it won't pain.

2009-09-19 at 04:00:24: had a good evening at the Festival. Race tomorrow -- not racing, but still very excited for the Jr. Bills at Sioux Passage!

2009-09-17 at 04:13:39: really doesn't like this late hour. G'night!

2009-09-17 at 02:53:23: is being taxed, yet still living -- exactly what I'd hoped Junior year would do for me.

2009-09-16 at 23:48:50: Is really tired of it, because he's done nothing to deserve it - in fact if deserves a lot better.

2009-09-16 at 01:35:57: @Damnfan VERY

2009-09-15 at 23:32:10: Bout to head home.

2009-09-15 at 03:25:25: YOU LIED. "Nothing too awful is going to come out of all this." This schism is almost too awful to bear.

2009-09-15 at 01:42:03: @meavictoria sleep is to you like food is to me.

2009-09-15 at 01:13:23: is listening to "Dogs" -- Pink Floyd.

2009-09-15 at 00:45:54: @TheShyRetirer Ah. Well. . . "Everywhere I Go" is playing in my head, but I'm about to listen to Rush.

2009-09-15 at 00:26:53: is having a weird mood right now.

2009-09-15 at 00:26:45: @TheShyRetirer As opposed to what?

2009-09-14 at 03:03:28: is goin' to bed soon. So, g'night! Question before I go: what are the different things that make your friends happy?

2009-09-14 at 02:30:21: @heyitsCait Everybody's workin' for the weekend!

2009-09-13 at 23:45:16: Is not going to the Newman Center. Oh well -- life night.

2009-09-13 at 22:19:34: Is having a good day! Hanging with Tori and Amanda, then life night, then Wash U Mass, then bed.

2009-09-13 at 17:52:52: got back from the teen donut-fest; we actually made a little money! Tor and I had a good time. 'Bout to head to Gingham's.

2009-09-13 at 01:01:15: @spensluh222 No, I'm not upset about it now. I understand, a little bit, what's going through his head. If he wants to stay home, it's ok.

2009-09-12 at 22:19:29: @spensluh222 Actually, I just discovered he's /not/. But oh well, he's talking to people.

2009-09-12 at 22:17:06: is tired. Of more than one thing, but not of it all, not one bit.

2009-09-12 at 22:16:47: @spensluh222 And guess who's going to Angela's!

2009-09-12 at 20:07:48: @natsuotoast Your hair is worth it. Keep it!

2009-09-12 at 18:55:11: SLUH swept the meet today! At Dylan's working on his computer.

2009-09-12 at 01:16:14: 's girlfriend hot-glued her glasses back together. &lt;3

2009-09-10 at 03:56:00: is finally goin' to bed. G'night!

2009-09-10 at 03:51:02: @carolimerose Just laugh and shake your head; you know I'm just playin'.

2009-09-10 at 03:13:49: @carolimerose That's a mistake easily fixed.

2009-09-10 at 02:54:58: @carolimerose It should at least work somewhat like FB.

2009-09-10 at 02:36:59: loves Mr. Baud.

2009-09-08 at 03:35:12: Has decided that he needs to start hanging out with the Rosemonts less as a group and more in small gatherings, 1-3 people.

2009-09-08 at 02:48:29: Phone is dying... ;_;

2009-09-08 at 02:25:50: TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI TORI

2009-09-07 at 21:22:01: @xofconformity probably after  Spencer helps you dump your HD

2009-09-07 at 21:14:17: @xofconformity In that case, something is terribly wrong. I think I should bring my screwdriver set over sometime after school.

2009-09-07 at 16:50:51: is gonna do some homework now. Had a good, but pathetic, run.

2009-09-06 at 22:27:31: @rawryjay Yep. I had a little problem with it, 'til I realized the BIOS was just mal-configured. Also learned some Linux techniques.

2009-09-06 at 22:23:29: @rawryjay Yes! And thank you so much! My computer is like three times sexier now, and it's all thanks to you!!!! xD

2009-09-06 at 22:21:11: is fixing his computer up so that Tori can hopefully play Sims 2 (oh, and I wanna play too :P).

2009-09-06 at 21:43:11: Thinks the Twilight community has ruined his chances of reading the books.

2009-09-06 at 16:25:01: I'm gonna get this day rollin'.

2009-09-02 at 03:38:26: I LOVE VICTORIA. Why must we make things any more complicated than that?

2009-09-02 at 03:12:50: is texting with Tori, my poor little emo baby. I wish I knew how to shake the proclivity to sadness away.

2009-09-02 at 02:26:27: @natsuotoast HI HAM!!!!!

2009-09-01 at 23:30:34: Can't believe he finally caved and got a twitter (and Tumblr, and Facebook. . . ).
