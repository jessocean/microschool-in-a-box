I think my issue is mainly a lack of familiarity with the whole landscape of color management, so unfortunately I don't have much useful feedback about this specific implementation

2023-05-25 at 18:16:36: I'm trying to use color proofing but cannot for the life of me get anything remotely vibrant into CMYK space

2023-05-25 at 17:45:05: Pray for me, I am installing a development version of GIMP that supports CMYK conversion

2023-05-25 at 17:35:56: So far I've
- used a CMYK color picker to find a color that works
- converted it to an RGB color value
- changed background color of RGB image
- converted it to CMYK image

but the color goes off in some random direction!

2023-05-25 at 17:35:55: It's white text on a lavender background.

First img is the color I want; first attempts lead to a muddy mauve, second attempts to a violet blue https://t.co/VwRyhmlkDh

2023-05-11 at 19:55:59: @lisatomic5 @goblinodds @love_of_reason So your high-EQ doctor friend would interpret emotions in an intuitive but draining way

And probably someone like Scott Alexander has trained to interpret emotions in an analytical and (presumably) not draining way

(based on https://t.co/cFEAXAOvuA )

2023-05-11 at 19:54:05: @lisatomic5 @goblinodds @love_of_reason Yeah, there are other things to consider, like maybe... is the emotional interpretation intuitive+instant or analytical+deliberate, and how draining is it?

Then you'd have
- intuitive / not draining
- intuitive / draining
- analytical / not draining
- analytical / draining

2023-05-11 at 19:39:59: @lisatomic5 @goblinodds @love_of_reason Mhm! I was sketching out a bit of a graph here... 

salience of others' emotions vs. ability to interpret others' emotions

Is HSP just high salience, or also high ability to interpret / high EQ? https://t.co/wlWWMp6kHx

2023-05-11 at 19:24:32: @goblinodds @lisatomic5 @love_of_reason If someone in that situation ALSO has autism-spectrum difficulties in interpreting social &amp; emotional cues -- that's a pretty intensely difficult situation

2023-05-11 at 19:22:53: @goblinodds @lisatomic5 And adding what @love_of_reason said - hyperattuning to other people seems like a different axis

One aspect is common in developmental trauma - "I need to be hyperaware of others' emotions to stay safe"

https://t.co/zxdmYMqw2W

2023-05-11 at 19:21:34: @goblinodds @lisatomic5 Can also be: "It's too intense and I get overwhelmed / melt down -- and maybe eventually I get numb or dissociate &amp; don't even get the msg"
^ issues w/filtering &amp; maybe hyposensitivity, more like autism and/or trauma stuff

2023-05-11 at 19:21:17: @goblinodds @lisatomic5 From a starting place of high sensitivity, there can be:
"It's intense &amp; I like it"
"It's too intense, but I get the message &amp; change my environment"
^ for both of these, there could be some commonalities w/HSP &amp; autism

2023-05-11 at 19:20:54: @goblinodds @lisatomic5 Yeah, I think there are multiple axes here... one around sensory intensity, one around attuning to others' emotions, and maybe another about how the person relates &amp; adapts to the sensitivity

2023-05-11 at 18:56:29: @FractalAuth I'd be totally fine with an analog temp control - just as long as they're separate, so you can set the temp &amp; forget it, and then just turn the water on and off!

(might be what's keeping it "stuck")

2023-03-10 at 14:52:15: @mechanical_monk When I use visual imagination to render an apple, I can make a wireframe, fill it in with color, cut it up, or w/ more effort play with light &amp; surface texture

but at the same time I'm aware that it's black behind my eyes.

Can also do it eyes open, doesn't make much difference

2023-03-10 at 14:47:30: @mechanical_monk &amp; I think visual imagination is more likely to be disrupted or dispelled by shifting your attention, like a daydream 

while hallucinatory visual perception (patterns etc) can definitely be affected by attention but not as easily "blinked away" (depending on dose &amp; substance)

2023-03-10 at 14:44:41: @mechanical_monk Visual imagination can elaborate on material in visual perception, eg playing off swirls of color or geometric patterns "seen" behind closed eyes

I think vis. img. is the same "space" where dreams happen

2023-03-10 at 14:39:30: @mechanical_monk Hmmm, I think that's approximately accurate for me. I explored the eyes-closed difference between visual perception &amp; visual imagination a lot while working at an ayahuasca center in Peru, bc psychedelics can affect both

2023-03-10 at 05:17:53: @hormeze Here's some stuff on schemas from the Coherence Therapy manual

I wonder how Core Transformation would handle a "functionless symptom" -- a symptom that's a side effect of a purposeful pattern

"And what does that get you"... might not have a clear answer https://t.co/DFPiyUbsrH

2023-03-10 at 05:14:40: @hormeze There's overlap for sure! 
"reversing the chain of intended outcomes" is a juxtaposition of "thing you used to do + reason for doing it" with "already having the core state in an embodied ongoing way"

There's something about layers of schema constructs though...

2023-03-08 at 22:09:45: @zencephalon @georgejrjrjr @romeostevens In the same way, you probably don't need to need to reify any emotional/mental subsystem unless it's actively involved in some internal conflict and needs a temporary handle in order to get untangled

2023-03-08 at 22:09:20: @zencephalon @georgejrjrjr @romeostevens When I talk about it, I might say: 

You don't usually notice your elbow as a separate part unless you've sprained something - unless it's been in unsustainable tension with another part of your body. 

When it's working fine, it's working smoothly in the background.

2023-03-08 at 22:06:17: @zencephalon @georgejrjrjr @romeostevens I like the ecosystem framing! I'd also rather use a metaphor that is less likely to give folks the heebie-jeebies...

2023-03-08 at 19:26:07: @quotidiania @AnneSelke Present-moment-spacious intimacy
- Wow! Amazing! 
- Being with the resonance w/o assuming it'll continue or that it means a particular thing
- Noticing what might be possible re: updating self-concepts, schemas, etc -- that *someone* gets me in this way means it's possible...

2023-03-08 at 19:22:46: @quotidiania @AnneSelke Present-moment-fixated
- I JUST MET YOU AND THIS IS CRAZY but we are DEFINITELY soulmate twin flames forever now
- unfounded extrapolation of resonance
- can become a pattern if someone is super good at opening up but lacks capacity for relational repair or differentiation üò¨

2023-03-08 at 19:21:58: @quotidiania @AnneSelke Relational-history-spacious intimacy
- Reliable, familiar, safe, easeful
- You know how the communication works
- Trust that you can recover from misinterpretations
- You can count on them

2023-03-08 at 19:21:45: @quotidiania @AnneSelke Relational-history-fixated intimacy
- ALL UP IN THEIR BUSINESS
- Fusion / lack of differentiation
- Blurring of self-other boundaries in a trapped / friction way
- Their behavior reflects badly on me as their [parent, wife, etc]

2023-03-08 at 19:14:49: @quotidiania @AnneSelke What about... "relational-history-intimacy" vs "present-moment-intimacy"?

And then both types of intimacies can be either fixated-collapsed, or expansive-spacious 

OHHH it's time for a 2x2!! ü§©

2023-03-08 at 19:12:18: @quotidiania @AnneSelke In the second kind, there might be very little "who we are to each other" beyond this moment, which can be "airy" / "ungrounded" -- or can also bring a lightness and spaciousness

2023-03-08 at 19:12:14: @quotidiania @AnneSelke One distinction I'm tracking: with the first kind, there's something to fall back on, in terms of the depth &amp; richness of experience in the relationship with this person... though that can also bring heaviness or complexity

2023-03-08 at 19:10:53: @quotidiania @AnneSelke Maybe something like... "deliberate" / "practiced" intimacy vs "spontaneous"?

Though, hmm - that doesn't quite capture that people can do a lot of deliberate practice in stuff like eg circling!

2023-03-01 at 19:30:53: @dispirateparts @algekalipso I think it'd be possible to test the 'felt safety' vs 'vigilance' thing re: hallucinations - if the person needs something changed in the environment, or does some grounding exercises, such that it feels okay to put on eyeshades - are closed-eye visuals present &amp; vivid?

2023-03-01 at 19:29:11: @dispirateparts I... don't know if it's physiologically possible for psychological factors to affect the appearance of tracers (depending on dose &amp; substance) - @algekalipso might know!

2023-03-01 at 19:28:07: @dispirateparts Oh, another thing - if someone doesn't feel safe in a particular setting on psychedelics, they may be more vigilant and perhaps more likely to unconsciously clamp down on mild open-eye visual hallucinations - patterning, walls 'breathing' etc

2023-03-01 at 19:25:27: @dispirateparts come to think of it -- ffffffff that's prob what happened to me, and I miss it!

working at the ayahuasca center, seems that I trained myself to tamp down on like the "wheeeee hehe!" parts of tripping bc I had to stay alert &amp; oriented to the needs of participants

2023-03-01 at 19:23:52: @dispirateparts Two... yeah I imagine that if someone is going into psychedelic sessions over &amp; over w/ intent to focus on emotions, body sensations, etc... it'd make sense that'd maybe 'train' their system that eg geometric hallucinations are less 'relevant'

2023-03-01 at 19:23:16: @dispirateparts Hmm, I think a few things potentially going on here... 

One, as someone gestured at in other thread, trauma-related dissociation can inhibit all kinds of responses to psychedelics (inc visual)

2023-02-26 at 00:42:18: @Malcolm_Ocean The folks who developed NVC figured that people generally argue the most about the story level, especially "how I am as a person." 

And they tried to make a protocol to help navigate to solutions, w/o needing to take on the extra, sometimes unworkable, weight of meanings

2023-02-26 at 00:41:55: @Malcolm_Ocean NVC says, let's find common ground on what they saw, how they feel about it, and what they're needing. 

Generally not so much to argue with about that - though of course, you may not be able to help w/ that particular need!

2023-02-26 at 00:38:25: @Malcolm_Ocean I like how you phrased it: "neutralize the worldview" / "figure out a solution w/o story"

NVC leaves out the story as way to focus on the strategic level - what is this person's motivation for saying a thing right now?

2023-02-26 at 00:37:42: @Malcolm_Ocean And there are a lot of valuable therapy modalities that specifically follow those charged stories or frames, work w/ them as emotional schemas. 

NVC was made for situations where there's not a container for that kind of therapeutic work.

2023-02-26 at 00:37:28: @Malcolm_Ocean Yeah, it's like... say worldviews (or stories, or frames) are a mechanism for bringing two things together really fast. Like a mousetrap! 

Observation--&gt;interpretation--&gt;snap!

"You did [or didn't] do the thing!" can get fused with eg "You're a bad person!"

2023-02-18 at 19:42:42: Our convo moved on, but something kept bugging me... 

Wikipedia has something interesting:

https://t.co/BaHuKD5Ot3 https://t.co/pwCPPNw9ki

2023-02-18 at 19:42:41: Me: But if you took those same characters &amp; scrambled them up into gibberish, it'd be hard to specify in any shorter way

Him: Sure. But for a specific gibberish string, the order matters! Order doesn't matter in a sushi smoothie.

2023-02-18 at 19:42:41: We'd agreed that a pattern of like, the entire alphabet repeated 1000x would be low entropy, low surprise, easy to specify with a short program. 

(the "short program" thing is the Kolmogorov complexity, turns out)

https://t.co/IQCNgEhV6Y

2023-02-18 at 19:42:40: (btw here's some background info on entropy in thermodynamics &amp; information theory)

https://t.co/cIaWAJK1WT

2023-02-18 at 19:42:40: I was thinking thermodynamic entropy, so I said blending the sushi would increase entropy

He'd initially said it be less -- I was confused, and then we realized he might be thinking about information (Shannon) entropy

I'm still trying to figure something out...

2023-02-18 at 19:42:40: Just realizing that I think I got Kolmogorov complexity mixed up with Shannon entropy...

during a sushi date conversation where we were trying to figure out if a sushi smoothie, besides being probably terrible, would have more or less entropy than tasty orderly sushi

2023-02-17 at 15:56:18: @captain_mrs @reasonisfun @blisstweeting @metaLulie It's interesting - that was also a cue / indicator at one meditation retreat I did. I *hated* the first time they tested it (it clearly triggered something), but later had some surprising experiences of not-dissociated not-flinching at interruption

2023-02-17 at 05:38:03: Yes! I want this! I didn't realize Christopher Alexander had written about this

And just letting the system update w/o pushing

2023-02-17 at 03:00:44: @m_ashcroft @QiaochuYuan @meditationstuff Yeah! Coherence Therapy (UtEB) is specifically about this. The stance is all about getting experientially in touch with the stuck prior ("emotional schema") - the way in which that pattern of thought / feeling / behavior makes deep sense to some part of you

2023-02-13 at 02:51:40: @FluidityAudio Someone might come to an integration circle and be like, "Uhhh so I saw God last weekend? Or like, I was God, but also the cosmos? Which was awesome, um, but now it feels kinda weird to worry about exams... but I also have midterms coming up?"

2023-02-13 at 02:50:14: @FluidityAudio Re 1, 2, &amp; 3 that you described... it's not just about working with adverse life experiences in the context of a psychedelic session, or talking about how that went

2023-02-13 at 02:46:59: @FluidityAudio For many events of this style, there's a norm around not offering unsolicited advice (it can feel like prematurely jumping to fixing), but someone might also ask the group for pragmatic suggestions

2023-02-13 at 02:44:24: @FluidityAudio People might want different things, or get different things, from that

For example:
- feeling heard / witnessed
- 'you're not alone in that'
- 'here's how I made sense of a similar thing'
- 'oh man, that sounds really hard. what are you needing right now?'

2023-02-13 at 02:41:45: @FluidityAudio This particular event is different from a meetup / discussion group bc we're not so much talking about topics (eg "What is microdosing?")

It's people describing experiences they've had (difficult, wonderful, weird, whatever!) and... getting some help making meaning of it?

2023-02-13 at 02:37:20: @FluidityAudio You're welcome to join if you're wanting help making sense of a past psychedelic journey, or if you're looking to make the most of preparing for a future session."

2023-02-13 at 02:36:29: @FluidityAudio The blurb for our events: 

"These circles are about weaving your psychedelic experiences back into your daily life and into the fabric of community, through sharing and reflection.

2023-02-11 at 00:30:57: @ruespieler, the process of prompting Midjourney for the image reminded me of how you've talked about "creating an avatar" when stepping into space-holding roles - it felt very clear which images were closer or further away, and this one really clicked!

2023-02-09 at 22:44:35: ...but I still think it would tend to intensify more slowly, or the person would tend to sit down, or that sort of intensity would be induced by eg sitting or lying down and closing eyes.

2023-02-09 at 22:44:35: That sort of very immersive very rapid onset / rapid decrease visual field alteration *while walking* also seems unusual for mushrooms. 

People can certainly walk around in very altered states...

2023-02-09 at 22:44:34: - OR be catalyzed by the addition of an extra short-acting substance (like inhaling nitrous oxide)

- Or perhaps it would make sense in a festival setting where the music is building to a climax

- Or perhaps if some really significant realization just "clicked" for the person

2023-02-09 at 22:44:34: I'd expect that such intense visuals would either:

- come on with a more gradual intensification and taper off more slowly as well,

- OR be catalyzed by a shift in setting (like lying down and closing eyes),

2023-02-07 at 05:59:47: Any thoughts, @_awbery_, @JaredJanes, @anielsen108, @JakeOrthwein...?

2023-02-07 at 05:58:10: Or is that an okay approximation of "trek-chod in the context of finding the presence of awareness in the experience of emotions as physical sensations" but there's also a lot of other applications / contexts for trek-chod?

2023-02-07 at 05:58:09: Is there more to trek-chod than "experience emotions as physical sensations in the body, with enough spaciousness to be present w/ it &amp; not freak out"?

2023-02-07 at 05:57:03: Here's a tweet that's prompting my question (see up &amp; down thread from there):

https://t.co/gQmcQZHaIv

2023-02-07 at 05:56:17: Anybody have thoughts on how the Buddhist practice of trek-chod relates to practices like Pendulation from Somatic Experiencing?

 Here's Pendulation:
https://t.co/APK00is8Ci

2023-02-07 at 05:52:23: @Lavendhole @degenerateyogi Their other caveat: 

"This week‚Äôs meditation technique is a simplified approximation to one from the Tibetan tradition, called tr√®k-chod."

So there's probably more to it, in other applications!

2023-02-07 at 05:51:43: @Lavendhole @degenerateyogi Their caveats:
"useful only when you have emotions strong enough to feel in the body as physical sensations. However, attempting it can also uncover buried feelings. For that reason, please avoid this method if seriously depressed, or suffering from other mental dysfunction"

2023-02-07 at 05:50:05: @Lavendhole @degenerateyogi It's basically what's already been said: get some capacity for being with stuff that arises in a spacious way (remaining present, not freaking out). Then notice the emotional texture of a thought, notice any accompanying physical sensations.

2023-02-07 at 05:48:59: @Lavendhole @degenerateyogi And here's the Aro meditation course, free via weekly email...

2023-02-07 at 05:37:24: @Lavendhole @degenerateyogi I do actually think that some of the non-Buddhist practices, like Pendulation from Somatic Experiencing, are covering some pretty similar ground in relation to "feeling emotions as physical sensations in the body and being okay with that":

https://t.co/APK00is8Ci

2023-02-07 at 05:36:26: @Lavendhole @degenerateyogi So you could start with the EG resources on opening awareness: https://t.co/4W23XUtexp

2023-02-07 at 05:36:15: @Lavendhole @degenerateyogi I don't actually know exactly how trek-chod relates to the Four Naljors meditation progression, but I think that being able to find spaciousness in relation to the physical sensations of the emotion is an important foundation

2023-02-07 at 05:30:57: @Lavendhole @degenerateyogi Ah, I think it's mostly talked about on the Discord, and probably also in different calls: https://t.co/SNOFo3M0Yn

Trek-chod is also apparently described in Week 11 of the Aro email course, and in the book Spectrum of Ecstasy, lemme see...

https://t.co/F3vFGdLO2s

2023-02-06 at 23:40:44: Last but not least, there are two phrases that have resonated with me around this topic of "what to do with feelings," which have come to mind in psychedelic or meditative states:

cure every last bit of attention

&amp;

find the place from which the dissonance is not a problem

2023-02-06 at 23:40:43: This last category is basically whatever helps you be with and get through the emotion with less damaging fallout -- if you run around the block or count to 10 or journal, anything!

2023-02-06 at 23:40:43: I'd add - most of my public notebook in Roam is full of these other approaches! Especially the pages on parts work, internal conflict, and grounding techniques.

2023-02-06 at 23:40:43: "and a preference for transformation (so that there are no damaging side effects) over suppression (actively preventing damaging side-effects) of emotion if available. You use the capabilities you have available, and perhaps add new capabilities over time..."

2023-02-06 at 23:40:42: 4) Any other available approach

Ari wrote:
"breathing, self-control, affirmations, psychotherapeutic techniques, physical techniques, energetic techniques, etc. with a preference for energetic techniques over physical techniques¬†if available"

2023-02-06 at 23:40:40: 3) Root approaches that find a place from which the emotion is not a problem (often - but not necessarily - leading to the energy moving through or dissolving)

2023-02-06 at 23:40:40: If so, a different approach is probably a better fit (after which the "emotion-as-signal-to-action" might get resolved on a meta level, or the corresponding action might become more clear on an object level).

2023-02-06 at 23:40:39: But maybe it's not that! Maybe it's something else! 

There are infinite possible actions, and sometimes the correspondence between feeling and indicated action isn't that clear.

2023-02-06 at 23:40:39: For example, when I'm getting antsy or nebulously grumpy at the computer, I might check - how does my back feel in this chair? Maybe I need to adjust my posture, get up &amp; stretch, walk around, redesign all chairs, etc.

2023-02-06 at 23:40:38: 2) Take appropriate action (sometimes very subtly)

Treat the emotion as useful information / feedback for your actions. For example: when hungry, eat; when tired, sleep.

2023-02-06 at 23:40:38: I'll add: 

For example, when my friend's cat died, I felt sad. It felt appropriate and congruent that I felt sad; I didn't particularly want to feel less sad (or more sad), and when I gradually felt less sad, that felt complete too. 

(Such a good floof cloud who sat funny! ü•≤) https://t.co/CjVMwPIh3z

2023-02-06 at 23:40:37: I'll expand on each of these... 

1) No response needed

Ari wrote: "The emotion is implicitly recognized as congruent. Nothing to do. No intuition of incongruence arises. Life goes on."

2023-02-06 at 23:40:37: When an emotion comes up, 4 main ways you can respond: 

1) No response needed

2) Take appropriate action

3) Root approaches that find a place from which the emotion is not a problem (often leading to the energy moving through or dissolving)

4) Any other available approach

2023-02-06 at 23:40:36: For once, I didn't draft the thread in Twitter!

https://t.co/JPIscQNRHF

2023-02-06 at 23:40:34: I've seen a couple of tweets this week about "what to do about feelings," so I decided to paraphrase something that @anielsen wrote a while back in a meditation group, &amp; rewrite it for a more general audience. 

(Welcoming any comments or corrections, Ari!)

2023-02-06 at 22:31:02: If that matches what you're wanting, I hope to see you at the February GCI workshops!

https://t.co/XEVWHKtNqY

2023-02-06 at 22:31:02: Top-down: realizing that you want to do different things, based on what you care about

Bottom-up: realizing that you care about different things, based on what you're actually doing!

Either way, you bring your intentions &amp; actions into better alignment - less internal conflict!

2023-02-06 at 22:31:02: And a little more about those ruts, "shoulds," and procrastination:

If you're feeling blah in those ways, it's probably a good time for an intention realignment! 

That might come through in 2 different ways...

2023-02-06 at 22:31:01: Also, good to check, if you:

- Are decently comfortable switching between a couple of different tabs or windows, and engaging with coaches in a text chat

If that sounds like too much fuss on your screen, I'd recommend in-person coaching, or perhaps 1-on-1 video calls

2023-02-06 at 22:31:01: Another good indicator, if you:

- Have enough slack in your life to attend a 5hr online workshop

(If you're in a crisis mode, w/ overwhelming stress &amp; time scarcity, I'd recommend starting w/ a 1-on-1 convo w/ a friend or a coach, to find the next little step of breathing room)

2023-02-06 at 22:31:00: Who tends to get the most out of the GCI workshops? It's an especially good bet if you're:

- Finding yourself in ruts, "shoulds," procrastination
- Facing some upcoming decisions
- Needing to make a lot of your own structure, in work or personal life

Plus a couple more...

2023-02-06 at 22:31:00: We've got a couple more Goal-Crafting Intensive online workshops coming up, on Feb 18 &amp; 19!

2023-02-04 at 23:48:43: Even the ~20s aftereffect mimics the "huh text is a little hard to read" effect of light psychedelic experiences

2023-02-04 at 23:47:38: Fascinating video!
"Motion after-effect optical illusion" totally fails to capture how cool it is that you can stare at a pattern for 1 min, then look around the room &amp; experience ~20s of *extremely psychedelic visual field warping* - then back to normal!

2023-02-03 at 19:28:12: @dispirateparts @m_ashcroft Do you have a sense of what kind of scope or focus you're wanting, for this? 

As in, what kinds of moves are you wanting to help people make? Or how would someone be able to tell if they were a good fit for the kind of coaching you're offering?

2023-02-03 at 19:26:02: @dispirateparts @m_ashcroft That's how a lot of therapy / coaching skill training programs work! 

I'm taking an IFS course right now, and we have practice calls where we take turns in the therapist / client / observer roles. Sometimes also w/ feedback &amp; light suggestions from an observing facilitator

2023-02-03 at 18:58:05: @xerambela @the_wilderless Also, root beer currently can't legally contain safrole, because when you feed lab rats too much they get liver cancer. Seems not to hold up as a human risk in more recent studies though:

https://t.co/DhqpARSosm

2023-02-03 at 18:55:48: @xerambela @the_wilderless Right, from what I've heard sassafras doesn't produce enough % safrole to be economic currently (though it's a fast-growing tree)

For a while there was a lot of overharvesting of Cinnamomum trees in SE Asia for safrole for MDMA, but I think another synthesis became more popular

2023-02-03 at 18:41:36: @seconds_0 @OneEyedAlpaca Hell yeah, this was a great idea!

2022-12-30 at 06:41:17: @hormeze [Part of me wants to talk about ELECTROPLATING but not to a hypothetical 5yo when it's almost 2am]

2022-12-30 at 06:39:53: @hormeze One carbon atom plus 4 hydrogen atoms makes methane, which is in FARTS!

It's not what makes farts stink, though - that's hydrogen sulfide, which is one sulfur atom plus two hydrogen atoms: https://t.co/0p7VBSld44

2022-12-30 at 06:34:18: @hormeze It doesn't have to be just two atoms, either! 

For example, carbon has 4 electrons (or stuffed animals) and wants 8. 

Hydrogen has 1 and (it's complicated) is happy with 2. 

One carbon atom can share pillows with FOUR hydrogen atoms, and then they're all happy! https://t.co/iHwjvNibYk

2022-12-30 at 06:30:41: @hormeze [Science aside: ionic bonds are grabby, covalent bonds are sharing, polar covalent bonds are like... sharing but one is kinda hogging it]

2022-12-30 at 06:27:44: @hormeze There's a lot more you could learn about from here! 

We looked at a pretty extreme version of grabbiness, with 1 pillow vs 7 pillows. But if the atoms have a less different number of pillows, they'll sometimes be happy with sharing instead of grabbing.

2022-12-30 at 06:23:02: @hormeze But a negative chloride ion could also stick to something like a positive potassium ion - a different element! 

That would make potassium chloride instead of sodium chloride. You can still eat it, and it tastes salty with a little more 'bite'. Some grocery stores sell it! https://t.co/rXGztnOYkq

2022-12-30 at 06:21:03: @hormeze In a reaction like that chemistry video, the closest thing to the positive sodium ion is the negative chloride ion 

[its name changes a little, but it's still chlorine plus an electron]

So they'll stick together - kinda like opposite ends of magnets! - and form table salt!

2022-12-30 at 06:19:08: @hormeze Now, one more thing -- when chlorine grabs an electron from sodium, they're cozy like neon in one way (surrounded by 8 stuffed animals), but they're a little out of balance in another way (their + or - charge)

This means they'll be attracted to things with the opposite charge!

2022-12-30 at 06:15:25: @hormeze This is because Benjamin Franklin was confused, a long time ago. 

We could have just as easily named it the other way around, but people got used to it, and now we're stuck with it!

https://t.co/mui0ukAE4l

2022-12-30 at 06:14:40: @hormeze Usually we say "positive" when a number is going up, &amp; "negative" when it's going ‚¨áÔ∏è

But if we're talking about electrons &amp; charges, it's backwards! 

As the number of electrons goes up, the charge gets "more negative" &amp; when you lose an electron, the charge gets "more positive"

2022-12-30 at 06:10:50: @hormeze Now, you asked what it means for something to be positively or negatively charged -- and we're getting there! We've just taken a few detours along the way to collect the ideas we need. 

Just ONE more detour where I have to explain a kinda dumb language thing...

2022-12-30 at 06:10:28: @hormeze And when sodium loses an electron, it's also cozy! It's surrounded by 8 electrons that were in an underlying ring. 

But it also has one less electron than the number of protons it has. So we call it an "ion" and say that it has a positive charge, a charge of +1.

2022-12-30 at 06:09:58: @hormeze Ok, so when chlorine grabs an electron from sodium, it's happy! It's surrounded by 8 electrons /"stuffed animals" and it's cozy. 

But it also has one more electron than the number of protons it has. So we call it an "ion" and say that it has a negative charge, a charge of -1.

2022-12-30 at 06:00:03: @hormeze Here's what that looks like in real life, not in a diagram, when each atom of chlorine grabs an electron from an atom of sodium: 

https://t.co/gg6RZRorR1

2022-12-30 at 05:59:15: @hormeze Ok, so when grabby chlorine with its 7 outer electrons and overstuffed sodium with its one extra outer electron meet up, what happens??

If the conditions are right, chlorine will grab one of sodium's electrons! https://t.co/XQSrpLchKj

2022-12-30 at 05:42:18: @hormeze [Science aside: that ring structure (Lewis diagram) is only one way to think about where sodium's electrons are. 

Here's another way, which is better for figuring out some things &amp; arguably more accurate, but not as easy for figuring out other things]

https://t.co/5zdA6v5PuY

2022-12-30 at 05:33:29: @hormeze [Science aside: The "grabbiness" is called electronegativity, and here's how it increases across the periodic table - there are several contributing factors that are cool to learn about]

https://t.co/vFDslAh4xr https://t.co/gLdE5NKBWh

2022-12-30 at 05:28:40: @hormeze And here's one way to think about chlorine and its electrons / stuffed animals:

It has a nice happy ring of 8, but then there's an outer ring of SEVEN and that's just not ENOUGH!!

Chlorine is feeling very grabby! https://t.co/otdEXAiqpA

2022-12-30 at 05:26:14: @hormeze Now let's look at sodium and chlorine, the elements we talked about earlier that make salt when they're together. 

Here's one way to think about sodium and its electrons / stuffed animals: 

It has a nice happy ring of 8, but then there's one EXTRA and that's ANNOYING

UGH https://t.co/W7HxHlyP6Y

2022-12-30 at 05:21:14: @hormeze So neon doesn't want to bond with anybody. It's happy as can be, totally satisfied, taking a nap!

2022-12-30 at 05:20:54: @hormeze Neon has 10 protons in the middle and 10 electrons, with 8 of those electrons on the very outside. 

It's totally neutrally charged - same number of protons &amp; electrons, so they cancel out. 

And it has the "happy number" of electrons outside, like the kids with 8 stuffed animals

2022-12-30 at 05:20:02: @hormeze Ok! Let's start with the noble gases. These are gases like neon, which we use to make light-up signs: https://t.co/fX77qyJhBX

2022-12-30 at 05:07:57: @hormeze Ok, so just how like the ends of magnets with the opposite charge pull towards each other, the protons in the middle of the atom and the electrons on the the outside pull towards each other

(they can't get all the way close for complicated reasons)

2022-12-30 at 05:05:49: @hormeze [When you're older, you can watch this video of a very clever man, Richard Feynman, who talks about how odd and loopy it is to try and explain this!]

https://t.co/5nM3k2hK6f

2022-12-30 at 05:05:03: @hormeze When we play with some bar magnets [here, have some bar magnets], you can notice that the ends w/ the same charge push away from each other, and the ones w/ the opposite charge pull towards each other

The "why" is too complicated for right now, but just remember the feel of it.

2022-12-30 at 05:03:58: @hormeze The little kids are like the "nucleus" of the atoms. In an atom, the nucleus is made up of "neutrons" and "protons". 

So, you asked what it means for something to be positively or negatively charged...

2022-12-30 at 04:51:35: @hormeze So how this relates back to elements and atoms, is that it turns out atoms are made of smaller parts. 

The parts on the outside of the atom are called "electrons" -- in our story, these are like the stuffed animals surrounding the little kids.

2022-12-30 at 04:50:12: @hormeze Now, these kids don't have a rule against grabbing toys, but they DO have a rule against throwing toys on the floor. 

So if you want to get rid of one, somebody else has to take it

2022-12-30 at 04:49:44: @hormeze If one or two stuffed animals are missing, the kid is so grouchy! There's a gap, they feel cold and a little lonely!

If a kid has one or two extra, they're so antsy! They're too hot and crowded!

2022-12-30 at 04:49:08: @hormeze [science note: I am only talking about the octet rule for main group elements on either side of the periodic table. The first 2 elements and the stuff in the middle of the periodic table all have a different "happy number" than 8]

https://t.co/740W4VkKkS

2022-12-30 at 04:48:57: @hormeze But why do they pair up? And why do some elements connect up and others don't?

Well, this is a little silly, but imagine some little kids, and the only way they will happily take a nap is if each kid is surrounded by EXACTLY eight stuffed animals

2022-12-30 at 04:33:09: @hormeze So, table salt for example - it's made of sodium and chlorine. 

On its own, sodium is a soft silvery metal that explodes in water. And chlorine is a toxic yellow-greenish gas that smells like bleach. 

But when they pair up, they form regular salt!

2022-12-30 at 04:30:02: @hormeze [Here I'd refer to Steven Universe fusions if we'd watched that show, though 5 is prob too young] https://t.co/DEW3IAnrox

2022-12-30 at 04:28:41: @hormeze Some things are made up of one kind of atom, like a pipe that's all iron. 

Other things are made up of two or three or many kinds of atoms. 

When atoms connect, we call that a "molecule." The thing atoms make together is different than how they are when they're apart!

2022-12-30 at 04:26:05: @hormeze So, everything that we can touch is made out of these building blocks that we call elements. There are over 100 different kinds!

The smallest bit you can have of an element is called an atom.

2022-12-30 at 04:19:51: @hormeze If I was actually going to explain it to a 5yo... well, first I would ask, what did you hear or see that made you think to ask? 

[to see what I can connect it to, that they're interested in &amp; familiar with]

I might start with this song:

2022-12-29 at 02:21:50: When I sign in, the flights still exist in the app &amp; website...

Only callback options are for next week, after my flight

Is this going to involve *another* 4hr hold?

2022-12-29 at 02:19:51: aaaa

10am, email from WestJet: "We're sorry to advise you that it has been necessary to cancel [your flights]."

Noon, email from WestJet w/my original itinerary, as if nothing is wrong: "We look forward to welcoming you on board!"

2022-12-27 at 13:11:33: @abhayance @kcorazo @acesounderglass Optimizing/exploring: enough functional abundance that there's slack to revisit "what you deeply want" - are there new areas you haven't been exploring? are there tweaks &amp; refinements to the flows of existing joyful meaningful activities?

2022-12-27 at 13:08:47: @abhayance @kcorazo @acesounderglass I think the Slack Inventory etc stuff is most useful in 2 phases / situations: triage, and optimizing / exploring 

Triage: System feels busted. Urgent problems. Running on empty in various ways

[Some middle ground where things are working well enough to mostly go with gut]

2022-12-27 at 12:36:24: @acesounderglass @VectorOfBasis Cool format!

I wonder... would it be useful to have a list of conversions?

Like, I can convert 20 min into, say, +2 (of 10) units of "physical and emotional rest" if I remember to listen to a Non-Sleep Deep Rest recording.

You could then refer to list of low on one (or extra)

2022-12-27 at 12:28:32: @kcorazo @abhayance @acesounderglass I'm not sure if I cite this in Slack Inventory, but the CFAR section on "Units of Exchange" is also very relevant!

2022-12-21 at 01:13:54: For everyone traveling to hometowns this holiday season, including myself - may we all have a very merry Ram Dass quote: 

"If you think you're enlightened, spend a week with your family."

2022-12-21 at 00:29:41: @relic_radiation @m_ashcroft Oh, something I forgot to add earlier -- whatever self-accompaniment is, or parenting / re-parenting onself, I think that "overwhelmed" is what happens if you lack access to it in that moment

2022-12-21 at 00:27:25: @relic_radiation @m_ashcroft This is probably also only one component of re-parenting oneself! 

Lots of other potential ways to map that landscape, probably lots of routes in terms of what comes before which other components

2022-12-21 at 00:25:16: @relic_radiation I think it's very related to grounding exercises and to what @m_ashcroft might call expanding awareness, what the Evolving Ground folks might call opening awareness

2022-12-21 at 00:24:45: @relic_radiation It's creating capacity to be with and metabolize emotional experiences. "Feeling overwhelmed" is feeling disconnected from that grounded spaciousness. 

Sarah Peyton would call this the "resonating self-witness"; IFS would call it "Self energy"

2022-12-21 at 00:22:28: @relic_radiation I think there's one aspect of this that comes from accumulated-life-experience-wisdom, which might indeed require an older mentor

But there's another kind of self-accompaniment that's very in-the-moment. It's more about presence than specific advice...

2022-12-21 at 00:16:49: @PhaentGames @FractalAuth "May we all find the right balance with precarious relationships"

It's more absurd but also unfortunately more realistic, as EA folks probably *would* find it more efficient to make a distributed market for purchasing shrimp-bliss

2022-12-09 at 21:41:41: @FossilLocator Fwiw, I like some of the basic EA moves ("let's fix neglected tropical diseases!") but I don't follow their logic out very far bc it tends to drive people into existential anxiety when the calculations inevitably get muddy

2022-12-09 at 21:41:30: @FossilLocator It's basically karma points, but with more math and less metaphysics. 

Like, how to think about making tradeoffs of various resources like time &amp; money, vs quantified reductions in suffering or increases in wellbeing.

2022-12-09 at 21:32:24: @FossilLocator This tweet is... probably an obscure joke, but part of the joke is that it sounds plausible for someone deep in the Effective Altruism movement. The Bay Area has a concentration of EA folks, w/ ties to the rationality community &amp; sites like LessWrong.

Does the event manage to have an "upward spiral" quality of fun / growing / learning / healing / building capacity &amp; connection? 

Or is it awkward, "can't find touch anywhere else"

2022-11-09 at 00:54:32: @relic_radiation Mainly because "well-facilitated" is doing a lot of work in the hypothetical... could you say more about how this person hosts the events, and what that's been like for you? Esp in comparison to a less well-facilitated event

2022-11-09 at 00:46:01: @RomeoStevens76 As I'm eating it, I keep thinking: "Oho! A marshmallow?? ...Oh. Huh."

The lumps are a sort of... non-salty mozzarella texture

2022-11-09 at 00:40:12: @RomeoStevens76 Hmm! After 90 min, it's browned on top, but hasn't really "set" - it mostly flops over instead of cutting cleanly

Flavor: Fine, a little "healthy" / bland

If I make it again, the main thing I'll change: blend the cottage cheese beforehand, bc the lumps are definitely noticeable https://t.co/a1wJRLG1VB

2022-11-08 at 22:58:34: @RomeoStevens76 Fair enough! I use the protein powder about daily &amp; the pudding mix often enough that I'm not too worried for myself, but I'll see 

Did add the maple syrup to the top

2022-11-08 at 22:56:48: @RomeoStevens76 Ok! Alterations from original recipe:

- I only had chocolate protein powder &amp; chocolate pudding mix

- I used Simply Delish keto pudding mix instead of jello, which has starch &amp; erythritol instead of gelatin &amp; sugar

I put it in a casserole dish &amp; into the oven! Now we wait... https://t.co/UdiPZi4yIy

2022-11-08 at 22:22:15: I'm going to start by mixing the wet ingredients together, mixing the dry ingredients together, mixing the dry into the wet

Hmm, one question -- is it just half a package of the pudding mix powder? Or do I actually make the pudding @RomeoStevens76 ?

2022-11-08 at 20:59:41: @Mikeachim Some groups might add guayusa to an ayahuasca brew, and the resulting mixture would certainly be psychedelic, but not directly due to the guayusa: https://t.co/1lWXBJu8Ey

If you can find that reference, I'd love to read it!

2022-11-08 at 20:25:24: @Mikeachim They were importing guayusa to Italy? Fascinating! 

But (having drunk a lot of it) there's nothing in there that would cause waking hallucinations. It contains caffeine, plus some of the compounds found in green tea &amp; chocolate. People sometimes report having more vivid dreams.

2022-11-08 at 20:14:46: @uberstuber @impartialpim @nickcammarata @m_ashcroft Yeah, my non-expert take is that what got disproven was "aether is independently-existing *stuff*" 

and the modern pervasive EM field isn't made out of *stuff* -- it's weirder than that

(not sure what to call it -- it's made out of interaction? math?)

2022-09-27 at 19:59:36: @Thinkwert @Nominus9 I feel like there's something missing here... to me, it depends a lot on the context

Eg, a party / hippie / burner event might have a lot more baseline openness, more spaces for social touch where people could lean into flirtatious touch - or lean away, if not feeling it

2022-09-27 at 18:36:42: @Thinkwert @captain_mrs Re touch -- and what's their base rate of spontaneous social touch?

It doesn't say the name of the event, but that's how I avoid missing important calls/events AND give myself time to switch tasks

2022-09-09 at 01:18:44: I love how groups of biologists often get called by the name of their research animal!

At field stations, it'd be like, "Ooh, the snail people were up so late!!" "Where'd all the bird people go?" 
(or shrimp crew, snake folks, etc)

2022-09-07 at 20:41:46: @pragueyerrr excellent choice! glamorous, yet reinforced

2022-09-07 at 19:27:31: @the_wilderless And you'd certainly want surgeons, etc to be able to do some kind of skillful detachment, as part of their job!

https://t.co/HgYHQrKZGm

2022-09-07 at 19:27:00: @the_wilderless Now, I do think all kinds of complex systems of numbness &amp; overstimulation are possible. 

Sadism, masochism presumably involve getting jazzed up from pain resonance as opposed to feeling it as a "nope" signal

2022-09-07 at 19:26:39: @the_wilderless From there, the line of thinking goes: you'd have to numb yourself to that internal sensation first, in order to go intentionally hurt another person

2022-09-07 at 19:26:12: @the_wilderless Far as I understand it: to her, "embodiment" includes an inseparable aspect of resonance

Call it affective or somatic empathy, mirror neurons, etc - seeing someone wince, hearing them cry, feeling them tense up - it echoes in the body sensations / limbic system of the receiver

2022-09-07 at 19:02:59: @the_wilderless If I was going to steelman the idea from the IFS book, it'd be:

We're more likely to harm others (or ourselves) if we're not tuned in to the signals that would tell us when to slow down, readjust, or stop. 

A surgical robot w/ a malfunctioning pressure sensor is a horrorshow

2022-09-07 at 18:55:21: @the_wilderless When I've been in acute or chronic states of stress, overwhelm, flustered -- I become clumsy &amp; ungainly.

I bruise my hips on tables, whack my shins, run into stuff

I figure that when I've contracted my awareness, I'm not as tuned in to my proprioception or environment

2022-09-07 at 18:52:43: @the_wilderless While I think there's no getting away from conflict &amp; use of force -- someone in another thread said, "Are martial artists disembodied?" -- there's also something important in here about feedback, sensing &amp; taking in signals from your environment, &amp; I don't want that to be missed

2022-09-07 at 05:12:02: And finally, an honorable mention that made me laugh:

1. "iridescent ferrofluid turing pattern maze, line art, gradient, logo, vector"

2. as #1, -"maze" +"spiral labyrinth"

First attempt:

2022-09-04 at 05:51:00: @lemonaut1 Can you zoom in on a specific moment when you thought, 'Man, I'm lonely üòî'

Rewind the tape. What was happening right before that? What did you notice, feel, think?

2022-09-04 at 05:50:50: @lemonaut1 Maybe something like, to get more specificity &amp; clarity:

Think about a recent social situation where the vibes seemed great but you felt lonely. Really put yourself in the scene, remembering where you were standing, how it looked / sounded / felt etc.

2022-09-04 at 05:49:54: @lemonaut1 I mean... for some folks, a starting point could involve pragmatic stuff about how to find &amp; make opportunities to interact with people who are interested in deep / quirky / creative connection.

But it looks like you're already in the thick of it!

2022-09-02 at 03:07:23: @cognazor @RizomaSchool @nickredmark It feels like you've expressed, on a content level: 'You're talking shit, Richard'

Check the weight limit on the package, I've used stuff like the 2nd image, and I'm sure the fancier things with toggles etc also work https://t.co/IqKX9ODb6T

Can you say more about the "Flip" - does that involve going right from dissociation to spaciousness? How does that work?

Main thing I can think of is friends' descriptions of ketamine-assisted therapy

2022-07-24 at 07:06:06: Re: working out a fear through sexual energy - the book Existential Kink might come in handy 

Sexual arousal is a dance of parasympathetic &amp; sympathetic nervous system activation - had trouble finding a good article, but this describes at least part:

https://t.co/WG8ihiRJCo

2022-07-24 at 07:06:05: For eating as a route of grounding, I can see how it could help signal to your system that the scene is safe

&amp; I figure digestion would be better after working through some of that high activation (run, exercise), and then doing some grounding (breaths, etc)

2022-07-24 at 06:59:32: Phrases like "rest-and-digest" &amp; "feed and breed" are often associated with the parasympathetic system

https://t.co/c6wBeoQrSh

2022-07-24 at 06:59:32: So going back to VV's 5 Fs, we've got

Fight, flight, feed, freeze, fuck

3 of them are sympathetic nervous system responses to threat (fight, flight, freeze)

2 are basic survival drives (feed, fuck) - and interestingly, they're also usually more associated w/ parasympathetic

2022-07-24 at 06:59:32: Some trauma therapists also include "Fawn" somewhere in there - a "please and appease" response to social threat

https://t.co/z7TanBYYmJ

2022-07-24 at 06:59:31: Then there are various "Five Fs" associated with responses to danger and threat

One version:
- Friend (reaching out for help)
- Fight
- Flight
- Freeze (state of high-tension immobility)
- Flop (collapse, parasympathetic dorsal vagal activation)

https://t.co/DDytMMu6PZ

2022-07-24 at 06:59:31: Then there are a varying number of Fs associated with sympathetic nervous system activation: fight, flight, freeze (sometimes also faint)

https://t.co/nCgYnweCRP

2022-07-24 at 06:59:30: Now let's go back &amp; look at the Fs!

Recall VV describes "Five Fs": 
Fight, flight, feed, freeze, fuck

There's 4 Fs from evo psych, basic instincts that an organism has to survive: fight, flight, feed, fuck

https://t.co/3i9qkduL6B

2022-07-24 at 06:59:30: I really like this "Pendulation" exercise - it helps me hold and gently work with my activation, in a bigger awareness of the grounded spaces of my body. Helps me hold that intensity with myself, even if there's nobody else close at hand

https://t.co/APK00iJbEi

2022-07-24 at 06:59:30: This might correspond with how VV's using "freeze" as one of the 5 Fs

He describes sitting in zazen, being w/ whatever tension &amp; anxiety is there - and that it's uncomfortable!

While at some point, you do just gotta be with it - I'd reach for something like "Pendulation" first

2022-07-24 at 06:59:29: or "blowing through a straw": inhale as if you are breathing in through the straw. On the exhale, purse your lips and breathe out long and slowly.

or ocean breath / ujjayi breath from yoga

2022-07-24 at 06:59:29: Some options for 2), bringing the energy down:

- breathe slowly &amp; deeply, with the outbreath longer than the inbreath (eg. inhale for 7, exhale for 11)

- box breathing

https://t.co/wtXjxNYcLA

2022-07-24 at 06:59:29: This corresponds with at least 2 of VV's 5 Fs - fight &amp; flight

Working out, using a punching bag, going for a run

2022-07-24 at 06:59:28: For 1), make deliberate movements - see what movements or sounds might want to happen - shake / stomp / jump - go for a run - go to the gym or do some other exercise, if that's familiar

Personally, when I'm upset, I like to tear up weeds in the garden!

2022-07-24 at 06:59:28: Now, for someone who's in an agitated state (fight-or-flight), but not collapsed, there can be two main routes: 

1) keep the high energy and work with it to shift the meaning / context, bringing more of a sense of agency and control / not-trapped

or

2) bring the energy down

2022-07-24 at 06:59:27: Also useful is the 5-4-3-2-1 exercise: 

Name 5 things you can see, 4 things you can touch, 3 things you can hear, 2 things you can smell, 1 thing you can taste

2022-07-24 at 06:59:27: In practice, that might look like inviting someone to just start making micro-movements, wiggle a toe in their shoe, even move their tongue where no one can see

Gradually build up, get them moving, get them back into awareness of the scene around them.

2022-07-24 at 06:59:26: Now, this shows that the route OUT of (parasympathetic) collapse goes back THROUGH (sympathetic) active responses on the way to social engagement!

But crucially, it's activation combined with safety and control https://t.co/mgycejYgfl

2022-07-24 at 06:59:25: At first, you get active responses to threat - frustration, fight / flight

If that doesn't work, and someone feels helpless/ trapped - then you get more of a high-tension freeze

If the threat persists, there can be hopelessness, collapse, shutdown https://t.co/PXTlCps67C

2022-07-24 at 06:59:23: The black paths show how someone's state can change over time

Ideally you'd like to be the wiggly line, be in ventral vagal for social engagement and then dip into sympathetic activation for excitement, sports, etc

The other line shows what happens under threat https://t.co/29kZ2GsIOQ

2022-07-24 at 06:59:21: This chart has a lot of info! 

A little confusing to map it to the previous one, but also very useful

Middle green box (ventral vagal) = lowest green part

Upper red box (sympathetic) = middle red part

Lower R orange box (dorsal vagal) is up top

Lower L orange box not shown https://t.co/SSXxQNrLEI

2022-07-24 at 06:59:19: I prefer this chart &amp; the next one, from the perspective of polyvagal theory

Here, all 3 of the lower boxes are part of the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS):

- Ventral vagal: social engagement, feels good!

- Dorsal vagal: if unsafe, collapse; if safe, deep rest https://t.co/KpXeN46h37

2022-07-24 at 06:59:19: This chart shows a basic 'window of tolerance' model - it's simple, but a little misleading

It's handy to know that "sympathetic" is fight-or-flight (also high energy play, excitement, sports)

Parasympathetic has several different states, which we'll see in the next chart... https://t.co/0AWYLxIbkY

2022-07-24 at 06:59:18: I'm gonna draw from something I wrote about the Window of Tolerance

It's a model in therapy about keeping your nervous system in a state that's good for talking about stuff, not too high or low energy

2022-07-24 at 06:59:17: I'm finding myself with two threads of thoughts: 

One is about sympathetic vs parasympathetic activation, and routes into and out of triggered states

The other is about how those 5 Fs compare to other sets of 4 or 5 Fs from various branches of psychology

2022-07-24 at 06:59:17: VV describes the "Five Fs": 
Fight, flight, feed, freeze, fuck

He says these are ways of activating the parasympathetic nervous system, ways of becoming calm after exposing oneself to a trigger

2022-07-24 at 06:59:16: As I'm listening to this, I'm trying to line up what VV is saying with the maps and models I'm familiar with

Not sure if the differences are more like surface-level word choice, or if there's some deeper differences in approach

2022-07-24 at 05:33:50: https://t.co/w8FyWfccf9

2022-07-24 at 05:33:50: I want to do a bit of a deeper dive into the section on exposure therapy - Tasshin pulled out two excerpts:

https://t.co/epQu7GEFlL

2022-07-24 at 05:30:09: ~35-45 min - "Ideal Apology" practice, imagining in detail receiving a sincere, thorough apology from someone who hurt you

In a similar genre to "Ideal Parent Figure" meditative visualizations

Eventually created space to also acknowledge own role in the dynamic

I think that iridescent hoop tape would be a great way to create some adornments in that style... https://t.co/atHx1BSTVM

2022-07-24 at 05:16:57: @RomeoStevens76 oooh this looks like a great idea

It's different from a yoga strap, right? Those are ~1.5" wide instead of 2", and not stretchy... would a yoga strap help in this position?

I can so picture this! The volunteer Rangers - conflict mediators &amp; problem-solvers - are a wonderful part of what makes burns work. Sounds like the type of healer character you'd find in a D&amp;D campaign!

2022-07-19 at 04:31:58: @nickredmark @DiamonDie So titration is part of pendulation

Pendulation is expansion &amp; contraction, bringing awareness back &amp; forth between areas of groundedness in the body &amp; the edge of an area of activation

Titration is about approaching that activation *slowly* and just going in a little bit

2022-07-19 at 04:28:59: @nickredmark @DiamonDie In working with nervous system activation - or imagery, feelings, memories that stir up discomfort - titration is the process of slowing down to work with just the smallest noticeable bit, just the edge of the tension, and  giving your system time to metabolize it

2022-07-19 at 04:26:39: @nickredmark @DiamonDie Titration comes from a concept in chemistry, where one chemical is slowly added to another, drop by drop. The chemist is measuring and waiting for a reaction to happen at some tipping point, where the solution might suddenly change color, or form a precipitate https://t.co/Rd4RTwphiM

2022-07-19 at 04:21:00: @nickredmark @DiamonDie Mmm... I think I've drawn the outlines of those two concepts slightly differently, in my own understanding. 

To me, they feel distinct, and definitely complementary

Titration is more about the pacing of engaging with actvation, "slowing and portioning":

2022-07-13 at 17:55:57: @liminal_warmth YOOOO do you have a freezer above the fridge

if so, it's probably that ice has blocked up the freezer drain, and when the freezer defrosts itself, it overflows &amp; drips down into the fridge

The fix is to hang heavy-gauge copper wire from freezer heater down the drain tube

2022-07-13 at 06:05:00: @meaning_enjoyer I sure don't have a topknot either, at the moment

2022-07-07 at 03:53:29: @loopholekid Are you familiar with neural annealing, as a metaphor / framework? 

And what about the whole "kundalini awakening" thing? I don't typically use that framework for understanding it, but there are a LOT of reports of people moving &amp; unbinding energy REAL fast in that way

2022-07-07 at 03:51:56: @loopholekid Well - working at the aya center in Peru, we had to do some delicate frame translation

The shaman might say "tienes malos esp√≠ritus adentro" (you've got bad spirits in you) -- we'd sometimes translate as "knotted" or "heavy" energy, if we didn't want to freak the person out

2022-07-07 at 03:45:03: @loopholekid ha! just remembered that's how it works in the "Kill Six Billion Demons" comic - the devils are chaotic and mindless until they're bound with a mask -- a face!

2022-07-05 at 05:55:27: @nickredmark When I hear "chaperone" I think of someone who prevents specific actions -- this sounds more like "wingperson"?

2022-07-04 at 17:40:34: @MAPSCanada Good to hear it turned out well for him! 

And at the same time, I'm surprised the article passed right over the ethical implications of slipping someone psychedelics without their knowledge.

2022-06-26 at 05:43:38: @TylerAlterman @AnneSelke I love the colors and the fabric!! And the way the two panels cross over

I think it could be a better... shape? It's making your torso look apple-shaped, in kind of an odd way. 

What if it came in a little at the waist and flared out a bit lower, at your hips?

2022-06-26 at 05:25:20: @MasterTimBlais @rhymeswithvocal That was about 7 years ago. Didn't fix all instances of the thing!!! Still a lot of mopping up to do. But it did make a fundamental shift possible

2022-06-26 at 05:23:44: @MasterTimBlais @rhymeswithvocal 2. (forgiving-all-past-Sarahs even if there's nothing to forgive)

3. realizing that those 2 patterns combined would result in present-Sarah being accepted by all-future-Sarahs

(for me, this involved the help of a combo of psychedelicsü§∑- it was a weird shape to install!!)

2022-06-26 at 05:22:57: @MasterTimBlais @rhymeswithvocal I ended up doing a simultaneous 3 part thing: 

1. (recognizing that everyone is always doing their best to act in accordance with their needs &amp; values given the limited resources they have at any given time)(committing to that)(recognizing that I can't do other than that)
...

2022-06-26 at 05:20:21: @MasterTimBlais @rhymeswithvocal source: I did this

for me, the first big shift in that pattern involved learning a bunch of NVC conceptually, and then actually *GETTING* the implications 

I realized that even as I judged past-Sarahs, I feared the judgment of future-Sarahs...

2022-06-26 at 05:00:44: @jonnym1ller And on a more interpretive level... maybe something about how, a grief that big can only come from a love that big?

2022-06-26 at 05:00:38: @jonnym1ller When some constriction releases, the emotion-sensation moves through - and you find that you don't actually die or break - it's a relief! expansiveness! return of aliveness-connection!

2022-06-26 at 05:00:30: @jonnym1ller Because the meaning is threatening, the sensations become threatening

Regions of somatic &amp; emotional experience become taboo, cut off - there's a loss of aliveness

2022-06-26 at 05:00:20: @jonnym1ller There's probably an assumption (deep emotional learning about how the world / self / etc works) that allowing the feeling to move through would break you in some way

(Bruce Tift talks about "annihilatory panic" in Already Free)

2022-06-26 at 05:00:06: @jonnym1ller Some scattered thoughts:

I think it's the constriction itself that "feels bad" 

AND - the constriction (big &amp; small dissociations, chronic holding patterns of muscle tensions, all the defensive reactions) is also "trying" to care for something important

2022-06-10 at 01:41:20: @hormeze If you're at a university that does independent or group study, that could be one route (New College of Florida would do it!)

Yeah, google 
college credit for independent study

You'd probably need a faculty sponsor?

2022-06-09 at 22:54:03: @meansinfinity I bet there was some term in Human Synergetics -@Malcolm_Ocean do you recall?

2022-06-09 at 09:36:47: @MasterTimBlais So appreciate you sharing this, in such detail! üôè

I made a, uh, real big thread in response:

https://t.co/jBKTvg1snk

2022-06-09 at 09:25:30: Ok! That's the end of this very long thread, for now. 

(btw, I drafted this with "it" pronouns - I realized partway through that you referred to the part as "him", but I was sleepy and didn't edit it)

2022-06-09 at 09:25:29: One way I'm seeing this whole thing: https://t.co/YYEcr8Punl

2022-06-09 at 09:25:29: Since then, I don't think I've run into that same intense, escalating internal blocking, or at least not for long

I've gotten more able to notice when I'm blended with an anxious, impatient part that wants to fix it already &amp; then work w/ that part until I can get back centered

2022-06-09 at 09:24:29: Here's an example of some of my own parts work, "trust-dancing" with a part that I initially called the "Obfuscator"

https://t.co/gd7umGq0jd

Through this negotiation and dialogue, I eventually found that a better description for it was "Steadfast Intermediary"

2022-06-09 at 09:24:29: Malcolm calls this "Internal Trust Dancing" - I've linked to 3 of his blog posts, here: 

https://t.co/okFl3mr06Y

2022-06-09 at 09:24:29: It will only shift once you credibly understand where it's coming from, and it trusts‚Äîreliably, on terms that it accepts‚Äîthat you will care for the thing exactly as much as it does, but with fuller access to your whole sensemaking &amp; therefore better strategies

2022-06-09 at 09:24:28: Also, let's zoom in on this part's role as a PROTECTOR

It's extremely loyal to -- presumably! -- some part of you, likely some tender / vulnerable part that got hurt at a young age. 

It's PROTECTING that part! It's not gonna give in. It's not gonna compromise.

2022-06-09 at 09:24:28: Whatever the wording, it needs to reflect the potential outcome that feels even WORSE than not having love

and then there's other stuff upstream of that (ie, why it's been so necessary to overthrow all your plans &amp; self-preservations for just a hint of a thing)

2022-06-09 at 09:23:15: So what I'm hearing, from this part's perspective:

[prev tweet, plus]

The only way to prevent [throwing myself under the bus? total self-obliteration?], is to seize up with anxiety pains at the faintest hint of love - even at the terrible cost of going through life without love https://t.co/lMNhFxRFgy

2022-06-09 at 09:23:14: THAT'S A REALLY GOOD POINT!!!

Let's camp out right there! That's what's holding its strategies in place!

2022-06-09 at 09:07:30: Let's revisit what it's caring for - its story and purpose:

https://t.co/PjofTlGRUd

2022-06-09 at 09:07:30: Reading these dialogues, I am SO on Team Tendril Protector, and I would like to help it find some MUCH better strategies to care for its stuff! https://t.co/jnFRQ5YA74

2022-06-09 at 09:01:57: Also, you're jumping wayyy too fast to dissolution!! 

Integration is a lag measure, happens naturally after everything else is sorted out (on its own terms). It's NOT the thing to push on!

2022-06-09 at 09:01:57: As an aside, if you need to explain love to REASON, I found "A General Theory of Love" to be really useful

helped me become a better mammal (still in progress)

https://t.co/Y5AWhPooNs

2022-06-09 at 09:01:56: You're pushing way too hard on love-in-the-abstract, or love-as-overwhelming-force

sometimes it needs a different core state! sometimes it needs a different precondition --- maybe listening, understanding, strength, power to take care of yourself!

https://t.co/T2wwZ4P3Ul

2022-06-09 at 09:01:56: (that power is IMPORTANT! when you untangle this conflict, you'll have access to that strength in an integrated way!)

2022-06-09 at 09:01:55: There's already an assumption in there -- "hey, if I carpetbomb you with love, you'll do whatever I want, right? You're clearly so desperate for it that you'll lose yourself in it, yeah?"

and this part is saying, "That's gonna be a big "nope" from me, pardner" https://t.co/VZOHiBSgWJ

2022-06-09 at 09:01:53: Anyway, the saturation with love thing. It's kind of like that sometimes, but it does NOT work through forcing!

2022-06-09 at 08:55:56: Similar thing happened to me when Malcolm tried to teach me how to do some seemingly-basic trampoline trick - he didn't realize he needed to tell me to tuck my chin, because his body does it instinctively. 

I whacked my head and got awful whiplash!

2022-06-09 at 08:55:56: Nick's thing seems to work well for Nick. And -- he's probably starting from a different context, or instinctively doing some moves that he doesn't even know that he needs to articulate, to get you to do the same thing

2022-06-09 at 08:55:56: Also, like... let's take a minute and revisit your assumptions about the "saturate it with love" thing

First of all, if you're working with this kind of part, you probably need to talk with someone who's been way more of a suspicious bastard than Nick is https://t.co/C1y2Uzx1yL

2022-06-09 at 08:55:54: You can tell by the way you react - when it's resistant, you go into: "fucking Threat you're getting on my nerves"

https://t.co/gOAYGkV57s

2022-06-09 at 08:55:53: Here's a related scene from that Somatic IFS Therapy book: https://t.co/EhL1xm4AUc

2022-06-09 at 08:49:50: This part is right! You're not feeling love for it at that moment:

https://t.co/HZfCefYtkC

2022-06-09 at 08:47:56: - You feel not-okay-until-it's-fixed, &amp; you're (energetically) fidgeting &amp; tapping your foot &amp; looking at your watch &amp; interrupting it and saying, 

"Yeah, yeah‚Äîso: love, dissolution. Can we wrap this up? It's doom if we don't sort this out, and I'm on a tight deadline here"

2022-06-09 at 08:47:55: When you're blended with a fixing part like this, other parts are absolutely going to resist you -- for good reason! 

- You're not actually negotiating in good faith! 

- You don't have space to really hear what the protector part is caring for!

2022-06-09 at 08:47:55: In an IFS therapy session, the therapist would be tracking this, and ideally lending their embodied sense of compassionate grounded presence to the scene, to help you find your center &amp; go from there

2022-06-09 at 08:47:55: (Somatic Internal Family Systems Therapy is somewhat better at describing moves - we're reading it in a book club!)

https://t.co/ysjM4SmXnf

2022-06-09 at 08:47:54: My friend, you were blended with some other exasperated fix-it part! 

A classic blunder! I've done it, everybody does it. 

Most of the Internal Family Systems instructions that point to the actually functional thing (being in "Self" energy) are terribly underspecified

2022-06-09 at 08:47:54: And, here's where you started off on the wrong foot:

You assumed that you already knew what this part needed, and that it needed to be saturated with love and dissolve 

(and thereby get out of your way so you could get on with your life)

2022-06-09 at 08:47:54: - Noticing, even briefly, the part's story and purpose

https://t.co/PjofTlGRUd

2022-06-09 at 08:44:22: - Flexibility - noticing and naming that moment where the label shifts from "THREAT" to "PROTECTION"

https://t.co/gdjcSdoiOU

2022-06-09 at 08:44:22: First off, some excellent moves that stood out to me:

- Doing this at all! That's a huge step! 

- Dialoguing w/ parts, working w/ words, images, felt responses

- Journaling - idk if you were writing this down in the moment or later, but it's very clear! Great way to keep track https://t.co/oNTKRhI4aR

2022-06-09 at 04:02:07: @sashachapin It's such an impressive escalatory clusterfuck of ritual and meaning - I knew what was going to happen, because a friend told me, and still I found myself wincing and wanting to cover my eyes as it got more and more portentous

2022-05-22 at 05:22:41: @HundredthIdiot @Spinachbrah +1 to this - not poison ivy

2022-05-20 at 03:15:31: @TylerAlterman 1000% y'all should go back and put something spectacularly strange OR mysteriously ordinary on the pedestal

2022-05-20 at 01:35:35: @DonyChristie @QiaochuYuan Something about holding one part rigid while annealing the rest -- I'm thinking of certain meditative paths

Anyway, I can't stand tucked-in blanket feet! I like being able to smooth out my blanket sometimes, and then bunch it up when I'm in the bed, and shake it out as needed

2022-05-20 at 01:33:20: @DonyChristie @QiaochuYuan OR - how about, someone who makes sure that their blanket is tucked in tight at the bottom of the bed, hospital corners, and wants the rest of the blanket to be as flat as possible. 

That is very neat and precise! Some people like it!

2022-05-20 at 01:29:32: @DonyChristie @QiaochuYuan And then - imagine somebody just shaking out their blanket all the time! 

They're hardly even getting a chance to curl up in it &amp; go to sleep! They forgot what it's for! 

That'd be like "over-annealing" w/o integration

(dunno if others use that phrase)

2022-05-20 at 01:27:49: @DonyChristie @QiaochuYuan I've got a shape in my metaphor-space, trying to fit words to it...

Ah! It's like -- when your blanket gets hopelessly tangled up. (Maybe you're extra confused bc you're a little kid, or tripping.)

Sometimes you just gotta shake it out! 
Then it drapes nicely
That's annealing

2022-05-20 at 01:24:06: @DonyChristie @QiaochuYuan Or, I think it's also possible to slam the "anneal! anneal!" reset button on just a portion of one's psyche... 

Not totally clear on that, but something like increasing rigidity in a few narrow areas, combined w/ lack of respect for structure or growth in the rest

2022-05-20 at 01:21:30: @DonyChristie @QiaochuYuan If no integration, there's potential for weird drift, like psychedelic or meditative experiences that get out of touch with day-to-day life, tangible sensory social experience of being an ape

2022-05-20 at 01:21:21: @DonyChristie @QiaochuYuan Annealing + integration --&gt; fluidity, dynamic groundedness

If it's just constant "Anneal! Anneal! Anneal!," that'd be like hitting the reset button over &amp; over

2022-05-19 at 14:33:50: @norvid_studies I googled 'how do snakes get rid of ticks' and the results were very gross

I will spare you the images, but I did learn: https://t.co/lYeAdu4UlW

2022-05-19 at 14:08:03: @norvid_studies Some can't manage it! They just have to wait for the tick to drop off. For animals that groom themselves, they use their teeth. For cattle, zebras, etc, I think there are birds (oxpeckers, in Africa) that eat bugs off them.

2022-05-18 at 04:39:00: @christineist Someone who went with just these could go in a direction that unhooks from paralyzing cringe (amazing! deeply needed!), but might also detach from... relational resonance? 

Could end up kind of skipping over the surface of the scene

2022-05-18 at 04:35:37: @christineist A potent mix! 

I like it, I think it works great for "lighter" settings, and I also think it'd need at least one other ingredient in order to work in a wider range of settings

Something like, to not lose the depth / gravity of whatever happened?

2022-05-17 at 18:12:51: @seconds_0 Yeah actually - 'heated glove liners' seems to get the higher price point / higher customer review sort of thing:

2022-05-17 at 16:01:58: @meansinfinity Do you plan to throw more of these events? Do you have storage space? 

If so, consider picking up stuff from thrift stores, secondhand stuff online (facebook marketplace, etc)

For lighting, long strings of LEDs are relatively cheap online, can change the color w/remote

2022-05-17 at 15:58:29: @meansinfinity Some thoughts:

- Are you in driving distance / do you have a car?
- Is there stuff from your home that you could use, temporarily? Pillows, small tables, lamps, etc
- Borrow from friends! Put out a call - rugs, cushions, string lights, paper lanterns, tapestries, etc

2022-05-17 at 06:17:53: @Nsousanis "Gyre" is a poetic option! (in the neighborhood of spiral / whirlpool / helix / whorl )

When the dissolve condition is external, ambiguous, prone to reversal, not under the direct control of the group - seems like a factor in losing momentum rather than having a clear wrap-up

2022-05-16 at 18:43:45: @euvieivanova The organization Mountain Justice seems to have been most active through 2010, and then the most recent event on their website is from 2015

2022-05-16 at 18:40:08: @euvieivanova Well, one thing is - MTR coal mining is NOT stopped... in 2015, Obama had a draft rule that would've added protection, but Trump got rid of it in 2017

2022-05-16 at 18:30:43: @euvieivanova I was part of some environmental activist groups, around 2008-2009, that had a clearly stated intent to dissolve when mountaintop removal coal mining in Appalachia was stopped - to avoid becoming big bureaucratic NGOs, inertia in search of a problem

2022-05-16 at 06:24:33: @realtimeai Brooke recently started a thread reposting "hire me!" tweets from folks... is there any remote type work you might want to do, that would be a better fit?

2022-05-16 at 01:48:43: @nat_sharpe_ @AskYatharth @joyurge @reasonisfun Very cool. I went to New College of Florida, which is more in that direction than most colleges, but not to the extent of hiring / firing staff! 

Love to see what NCF students would do with more involvement in policy decisions - hard to do, once it became part of public system

2022-05-16 at 00:43:45: @nat_sharpe_ @AskYatharth Whaaaat - sounds fascinating! Would love to read more, if you've got links!

Possibly also of interest to @joyurge &amp; @reasonisfun

It's been an agonizing back and forth over the past two months, with a more final clarity emerging a couple weeks ago)

I'm in the midst of trying to find my own way, and my immediate attention is on sorting out a lot of practical matters about where to live and what to do

Prompts were bite-sized, and reflecting on them live on the call (in pairs and in writing) gave a clear time container - no "putting it off til later"

2022-05-14 at 06:26:18: @VividVoid_ @QiaochuYuan I also had a sub-thread in there about the impact of The Whole Giant Thing About Artificial General Intelligence on the scene

2022-05-14 at 06:19:50: @VividVoid_ @QiaochuYuan This was said with kind of a pained smile-grimace, with the implication being - dissociating would help her do the rationally most optimal thing, mathematically speaking

2022-05-14 at 06:18:52: @VividVoid_ @QiaochuYuan I went to the EA Global conf in 2018, and they had a booth set up with VR headsets, showing people graphic immersive slaughterhouse footage

One woman sat down at our lunch table, said she'd had a panic attack from watching it, but that she's "getting really good at dissociating"

2022-05-14 at 06:13:46: @VividVoid_ @QiaochuYuan the scene has probably inherited a lot of memetic moral flavor from abrahamic religions, but it's disowned and unmetabolized - it can come out sideways

a bunch of folks are atheists, but still whipping themselves with a fear of wrong decisions that feels just like fear of hell

2022-05-14 at 06:09:10: @VividVoid_ @QiaochuYuan had a thread about what felt bad from the inside of the scene

I don't think there are generally any beefs with doing charity more effectively... more about cultural underpinnings of scrupulosity and burnout

2022-05-04 at 18:21:05: @TylerAlterman @sashachapin In polyvagal terms, that motion can also bring people out of a freeze / dissociation / collapse, through bringing some sympathetic nervous system activation online

2022-05-04 at 18:20:56: @TylerAlterman @sashachapin Sensorimotor psychotherapy &amp; Somatic Experiencing folks often talk about clients going into completing pushing away motions, or running motions, and finding something meaningfully unstuck

2022-05-04 at 18:19:25: @TylerAlterman @sashachapin In terms of finding what "fits," there's often an invitation to notice any "uncompleted motions" in the body

Might look like bringing grounded awareness to body sensations, noticing any tension or numbness, noticing any inclination to move

https://t.co/itRV7qMmzU https://t.co/jemX6MFDz3

2022-05-04 at 18:16:23: @TylerAlterman @sashachapin Or perhaps revisiting the memory from more of a first-person perspective, and taking strong protective actions that weren't accessible at the time - perhaps standing firm, pushing someone away, calling in help, leaving the scene - whatever fits

2022-05-04 at 18:16:15: @TylerAlterman @sashachapin Some possibilities might include - putting your adult, strong, grounded self in the scene from memory, and accompanying your child self - changing how the scene plays out, in a protective way.

2022-05-04 at 18:12:47: @TylerAlterman @sashachapin Caveat - I'm sure the recommendation is to do this accompanied by a therapist, etc. 

And, similar experiences do sometimes arise spontaneously during mindful substance-aided inner work, so - I figure, potentially useful to plant that seed if you're going in anyhow

2022-05-04 at 18:11:06: @TylerAlterman @sashachapin There's also a thing that Coherence Therapy calls "empowered reenactment" &amp; somatic therapies might call "completing the motion" or "completing defensive actions"

2022-05-04 at 18:00:07: @TylerAlterman @sashachapin You could consider having a photo on hand, of middle-school-age you.

2022-05-04 at 16:16:07: @christineist @CompliceGoals What else, about inspiration... I mean, @visakanv's call to "make 100 things" is great. 

A different approach from "waiting around" for inspiration! If you wade into the kind of thing you're wanting to do, over and over -- sometimes you'll make a clunker, sometimes it'll blossom

2022-05-04 at 16:13:26: @christineist It's off to the side of your main workspace, so you can dip over there, write it down &amp; come back to your primary focus. The idea's not lost &amp; it's also not distracting.

It's mentioned in a "task system" exercise I made for the @CompliceGoals workshops:

2022-05-04 at 16:12:04: @christineist Prioritizing one area of inspiration often means putting other ideas on the backburner for now. 

Can help to make a "dreamcatcher" / "thought inbox" --an easily-accessible paper or digital note, where you capture little bits of ideas &amp; save them for later

2022-05-04 at 16:07:15: @christineist Great question! Not sure I've explored that one much... 

One approach would be to get clear on what area in particular you're inviting inspiration, and give it a corresponding amount of priority. 

Where possible, rearrange other things to make slack: https://t.co/rU8z9bD6Ay

2022-05-03 at 20:43:25: @nosilverv Unfortunately, not always "most grounded wins". 

Someone who is dissociated / compartmentalized + in a position of external / situational power can also "win" the narrow battle, while ignoring impacts on broader context

2022-05-03 at 02:50:18: @JasonLG1979 @rhymeswithvocal Huh, I wonder if they're doing similar things to audio processing in the brain!

Although, not the same reason inhaled nitrous oxide makes people's *speaking* voice lower -- that's just because it's denser than air! 

Opposite of the helium "mickey mouse voice" effect

2022-04-22 at 21:42:46: @hormeze You might put on a long sleeve shirt under the jacket, so even though it is still kind of scratchy, it's not itching YOU

2022-04-22 at 21:40:27: @hormeze You might wear a soft hat &amp; scarf &amp; gloves instead of the  itchy jacket

You might tell your mom that the jacket is itchy &amp; ask for a different jacket

You might go inside and warm up

You might get some hot cocoa and take it back outside!

2022-04-22 at 21:39:20: @hormeze You can zoom out and find something that both parts agree on - they both want you to feel good!

And from there, it's easier to notice that there are actually a lot of different things you might do to make both parts happy - it's not just "jacket ON or OFF"

2022-04-22 at 21:37:26: @hormeze Fortunately, you can notice when you feel stuck, and zoom in or out on the situation!

These parts DISAGREE on what to do with the jacket - ON or OFF?

But the part that cares about warm doesn't want you to be itchy!

&amp; the part that cares about soft doesn't want you to be cold!

2022-04-22 at 21:33:08: @hormeze This is tough! You might feel stuck -- COLD + SOFT or WARM + ITCHY?? 

Neither of these combos feels good!

2022-04-22 at 21:32:31: @hormeze Like maybe you do feel cold, and part of you wants to put on a jacket...

But maybe some OTHER part of you thinks the jacket feels ITCHY, and wants you to keep the jacket OFF so you can have a good feeling on your skin!

2022-04-22 at 21:28:40: @hormeze It's nice when it works like that!

Sometimes it's a little more complicated. 

Sometimes one part of you wants to have a certain kind of experience, like feeling at a cozy temp...

But at the same time, some OTHER part of you is in a tug-of-war -- trying to do a different thing!

2022-04-22 at 21:26:09: @hormeze When you're cold, you put on a sweater or get snuggly under a blanket. 

And you feel warm &amp; cozy! And you sigh and it feels just right. 

Then later, maybe you get too hot &amp; sweaty! You take off the sweater or kick off the blanket

And you feel cool &amp; refreshed, &amp; it feels nice!

2022-04-20 at 16:31:11: @rhymeswithvocal Basic knots, also useful. Camping in general, even car camping, as a way to get familiar with gear, how much food and water you need, how to deal with rain &amp; cold &amp; heat/sun outdoors, how to cook outside. How to build a fire.

2022-04-20 at 16:28:00: @rhymeswithvocal I took it bc I was preparing to work at a retreat center in Peru, several hours from a hospital. 

IIRC, in the US it's a weekend course. Some places call that first level Remote First Aid instead.

Wilderness First Responder is a way more involved certification.

2022-04-20 at 16:23:55: @rhymeswithvocal I found that a Wilderness First Aid course was much more useful than the basic one! Basic sometimes is just about when to call an ambulance and what to do until they get there.

2022-04-08 at 22:42:04: @taalumot Well... one thing might be, does this person already like wine? Do they want to be into wine? 

If they have hesitation / mixed feelings, might be worth getting more clear &amp; specific on what they do &amp; don't like

2022-04-08 at 03:43:11: @mattgoldenberg @coponder Oh! Might also be some useful stuff under "subject-object shift"

https://t.co/vm5hCwv9qd

2022-04-08 at 03:41:46: @mattgoldenberg @coponder Oh yah there's some good stuff about constructs in the Coherence Therapy manual! 

They talk about "ontology" and also "epistemology": https://t.co/SlcttIRJma

2022-04-08 at 03:39:53: @mattgoldenberg @coponder And then some of the higher-order schema stuff would be ontological - how the world works, how a person operates in the world, what is a self, etc

(eg, is a "self" the kind of thing that can be fundamentally bad?)

2022-04-08 at 03:38:30: @mattgoldenberg @coponder So from there, "adding or removing a category of acceptable evidence" about the self would be an epistemology shift

(eg, differentiating from fusion w/ parents' beliefs about you, partner's beliefs about you)

2022-04-08 at 03:38:20: @mattgoldenberg @coponder Oof jeez, I get these mixed up sometimes... I've been figuring that epistemology is, "how do we know things" and ontology is "what is things tho"

2022-04-08 at 03:15:10: @mattgoldenberg @coponder Also more stuff in my roam notebook, for example under [[Bucket errors]], [[Metaphor]] &amp; [[Self-concept]]

The material on Transforming Your Self &amp; Coherence Therapy has a lot of applied methods for refactoring... I guess you could say ontologies?

https://t.co/wBac5ih2JR

2022-04-08 at 03:12:25: @mattgoldenberg @coponder But if by "new ontologies", you're wanting to make new maps / frameworks / metaphors / understandings of stuff that's already part of your experience - then I think Matt's link is great

2022-04-08 at 03:05:19: @mattgoldenberg @coponder If they're not trying to make those frameworks make sense with anything else in particular - that's when I made the joke about machine elves; that's one way of explaining a weird experience by creating a category for it that's unmoored from most other parts of understanding

2022-04-08 at 03:04:27: @mattgoldenberg @coponder That's why I thought of psychedelics - people can have a LOT of weird experiences, and can try to map various shapes of understanding onto that

2022-04-08 at 03:03:44: @mattgoldenberg @coponder When I heard "novel ontologies" w/o context, I thought you meant generating entirely new understandings of what things are, what a person is, what existence is, what consciousness is, novel categorization schemes for all of the above, etc.

2022-04-08 at 02:57:36: @mattgoldenberg @coponder Oh, very cool! 

I didn't have a very clear idea of what you were asking, Robin -- fascinating to read this, and I'm seeing that it's more about metaphor design, extending from what you already understand, making the implicit explicit at the edge of knowing

2022-04-07 at 23:56:44: @coponder ü§î I'm having a "this is how you get ants" moment, except for like... machine elves

"Do you want machine elves? Because this is how you can get machine elves!" https://t.co/plQVjAHEnQ

2022-04-07 at 23:19:51: @coponder And do you mean, ontologies that are known by somebody but new to the subject?

Or entirely novel ontologies?

2022-04-07 at 23:18:44: @coponder What's the intent or context?

Psychedelics can definitely catalyze rapid ontology change, but often in sorta random directions

I mean, it def is on a basic level (R brain controls L side muscles &amp; vice versa)

But I bet it's also related to "trying to" do stuff with your face - I wonder if our spontaneous emotional expressions are more symmetric?

2022-04-03 at 19:19:08: @gptbrooke @embryosophy @mesolude @MasterTimBlais Huh! Pretty sure I do this too. Years ago, I tried practicing in a mirror to "smile better," and I had wayyy less conscious control of the muscles on the L side of my face.

2022-04-03 at 07:17:31: @MultimediaMage @embryosophy Had a handle, and yes I did!

Till ev'ry casual corner blooms

- Maintenance-free!
- Very cost-effective
- Very effective at preventing pregnancy

Cons:
- Ughhh I got lots of spotting w/ copper IUD
- I might've put on a few pounds after Kyleena? Hard to tell if it's water retention, or change in muscle from lifting, or just fat

2022-03-21 at 19:16:59: @pragueyerrr Other things that made a difference: 
- Injected anaesthetic, not topical spray-on
- I asked them to use an "atraumatic tenaculum" - you can google it, it's a non-stabby version of a usually-stabby tool (whyyy)

2022-03-21 at 19:16:43: @pragueyerrr If you decide to get one, look for a provider who specializes! Made a HUGE difference for me, horrible pain with a general clinic, vs *actually* 20 sec mild discomfort ("was that it?") with a specialist where they place hundreds per month.

2022-02-10 at 21:39:40: @nowtheo Ah, I'm noticing another part of the article you wrote, and seeing a few things

It does not line up w/ my understanding of Coherence Therapy, that disconfirming experiences need to be "equally intense"

Just need to be specifically incompatible w/ the emotionally-learned schema https://t.co/8H3umgRwjk

2022-02-10 at 21:23:23: @nowtheo It's a really deep shift!

From "parts of me are fucked up and I have to wrangle / control / suppress them"

To "parts of me are powerfully TRYING to help, &amp; they might be like, pushing on the "PULL" door - but only bc they've been blindfolded! If they saw, they'd shift!" https://t.co/8E4qtuQdTH

2022-02-10 at 21:18:02: @nowtheo - The deeply felt emotional truth of "I am worthless"
- The efficacy of the "holding back" strategy to prevent attack
- The learning "putting yourself out there" always leads to attack

etc

"I have distorted thoughts about my worthlessness, I'm hypersensitive to criticism, and that leads me to never put myself out there in art/business/social situations.

So I need to remember I'm catastrophizing &amp; tell my inner critic 'STOP! That's not true!'"

2022-02-10 at 20:59:22: @nowtheo https://t.co/FSCFdIXW7l

2022-02-10 at 20:58:02: @nowtheo The Coherence Therapy training manual gives a lot of examples of the "worse ordeals" very effectively avoided by maintaining negative self-regard / low self-worth

(Actually I'll put the chart in the next tweet) https://t.co/WOcmjhJu1A

2022-02-10 at 20:53:40: @nowtheo For example, I want to take a look at the scene you sketch in the article... https://t.co/rb6T2WdKPl

2022-02-10 at 20:51:26: @nowtheo (i think I could make a swole doggo / sad smol doggo meme of this...)

2022-02-10 at 20:51:10: @nowtheo This whole stance can help people shift from a sense of helplessness to agency üí™

From: "I have thought distortions which are causing maladaptive behaviors" (CBT)

To: "My behaviors make deep sense from the perspective of a part that is doing its best to care for me!" (CT)

2022-02-10 at 20:43:41: @nowtheo They're just: 
- the understanding that made the most sense at the time, plus
- strategies or behaviors that feel compellingly necessary in light of that understanding, plus
- emotional "overwrite protection" that's preventing those understandings from updating with new learnings

2022-02-10 at 20:43:23: @nowtheo But in a situation where someone has a thought / feeling / behavior that is bothering them in the present

(eg: "I keep doing this &amp; it sucks &amp; I don't know why!!")

It's not that the original "learnings about how the world works" are maladaptive...

2022-02-10 at 20:34:33: @nowtheo If the learnings are non-conscious, nonverbal, emotionally intense - then they do need to be brought into conscious awareness and touched into emotionally, in order to be available for updating 

(the book Unlocking the Emotional Brain describes neuro research in more detail)

2022-02-10 at 20:32:13: @nowtheo If the learnings are just conceptual, not emotionally intense - it's easier to update w/ new info: 

"Teacher said 0 was smallest, but now we're learning about negative numbers &amp; they're smaller in a different weird way. Guess there's more than one way for numbers to be smaller!"

2022-02-10 at 20:29:47: @nowtheo In fact, it's really the core of Coherence Therapy

CT says: From the time we're born, we're taking in so much information about the world, so many experiences - some of them very intense

It's impossible to avoid making assumptions &amp; generalizations - that's how we learn!

2022-02-10 at 20:22:52: @nowtheo Love the way you bring in Coherence Therapy &amp; memory reconsolidation! 

One suggestion: the frame of "maladaptive" beliefs doesn't resonate with what I know of the Coherence Therapy stance --  it sounds more like CBT

It's a subtle and crucial distinction... https://t.co/kPJRJo0EA2

2022-02-10 at 20:01:48: @joespurpleshirt @tpotvibecamp Yes!! https://t.co/JBcNDIIdci

2022-02-10 at 19:56:22: @Morphenius Not all Buddhist approaches would agree: https://t.co/Mguz2354qd

2022-02-10 at 18:45:45: @the_wilderless Oh and mayyybe lysine, if you have cold sores bothering you

Theory is that it competes w/ arginine in some way (another amino acid, which the virus uses to replicate)

Evidence in humans not super clear, but I don't think much side effects either

2022-02-10 at 18:34:49: @the_wilderless Also vitamins and micronutrients and all that

like idk Vitamin D &amp; oily fish &amp; choline from like over-easy or softboiled eggs

also maybe *handwaves* adaptogens
maybe lion's mane, for recombobulating nervous system stuff

2022-02-10 at 18:31:34: @the_wilderless Oh!! Also, another thing entirely -- should be part 0, before A, B, or C -- how're you doing with your general overall health &amp; wellbeing?

Are you getting enough - sleep, water, electrolytes, veggies, sunlight, physical movement, etc?

Support yoself!

2022-02-10 at 18:22:27: @the_wilderless Kinda like degaussing your immune system, come to think of it!

If you can't just tell your immune system "shh, be normal", then you can go "WOOOGITYWOOGITYWOOGITY!!!" at it -- it gets startled but then kinda resets

https://t.co/BXU7TvyBQI

2022-02-10 at 18:16:44: @the_wilderless I personally think the risks of kambo outweigh the benefits, but if you are specifically dealing with "weird shamanic immune stuff" it would certainly be one way of purging and resetting that!

(it's basically giving yourself an allergic reaction to frog defensive secretions)

2022-02-10 at 18:15:56: @the_wilderless C cont'd
... I hesitate to even mention this, but I do think the kambo folks would say "this is a great reason to do kambo!"

(they say that about *everything*; I have NOT yet been convinced)

2022-02-10 at 18:15:36: @the_wilderless C) Third approach... instead of the most responsible version (slowing down &amp; reducing intensity), you could decide to increase intensity! 

If so, best approached in combo w/ (B) + mentorship

Examples:
- Vomit it all up w/ ayahuasca
...

2022-02-10 at 18:08:09: @the_wilderless ...who's been there before. Idk if that'd be someone shamanic, or one of the kinda woo integrative health practitioners I don't usually recommend, or what

- Maybe some kinda somatic therapy modality... Somatic Experiencing, or Somatic Internal Family Systems, or maybe Hakomi

2022-02-10 at 18:06:53: @the_wilderless That might look like:
- Expanding your awareness (vs contracting)
- Finding a different way to receive &amp; integrate feedback from some parts of you
- Finding mentorship and guidance from somebody who is deeply integrated, weird, nerdy, holistic...

2022-02-10 at 18:06:35: @the_wilderless There's a lot of stored up *something*, and you've been hitting "pockets" of it and having an unpleasantly bumpy ride

There might be some way to reduce that drag / friction / juddering and go more smoothly into and through whatever emotional-physical pain and intensity is there

2022-02-10 at 18:06:16: @the_wilderless B, cont'd

I'm not sure exactly what that involves, but something like... you sort of know you have a big unintegrated "psychoneuroimmunological" thing that you're trying to work with and untangle

https://t.co/yoYUeFNLHN

2022-02-10 at 18:05:43: @the_wilderless I can think of at least 3 broad approaches:

A) The responsible thing to do, is slow down &amp; reduce intensity (as @ChasingMyself recommended)

B) There's probably a creative / wise way to change something about your approach, without necessarily slowing down...

2022-02-10 at 17:24:25: @visakanv *sigh*
psychedelics

Folks can just sign up for super long intense ayahuasca retreats, or go to an ibogaine clinic, or take 5-MeO-DMT

I really don't recommend "do the hardest thing on day one" in this area!

(unless using ibogaine to stop being addicted to opiates) https://t.co/JGONz8lCJi

2022-02-10 at 01:50:26: @imperialauditor "Boson" just sounds big, way bigger than "baryon"! 
(dare i say bouba)

New mnemonic!
Bosons are like bosuns
in that they're responsible for field lines and group cohesion

https://t.co/0gGbzPhOzV

2022-02-10 at 01:03:24: @embryosophy @jessicamalonso True! Idk if there's any psychological followup with that person... 

I mean, I think in some ways "having a seizure" is outside the "window of tolerance" -- as in, "some parameter of this system has exceeded operating tolerances, rebooting"

2022-02-10 at 00:53:54: @jessicamalonso Or like, if someone had a history of manic episodes, where they made decisions they later regretted

and they found themselves getting really really excited and ecstatic

they might feel simultaneously upset / afraid about the 'positive' feelings bc of anticipating bad outcomes

2022-02-10 at 00:49:58: @jessicamalonso Even purely physiological examples, like this case of toothbrushing-orgasm-seizures

Orgasm is generally considered a positive or pleasant sensation, but in this case:
"She believed that she was possessed by a demon and felt shame and fear" üò∞

https://t.co/XVXurlnT34

2022-02-10 at 00:46:11: @jessicamalonso Fascinating question! 

I think... intense emotions / sensations that are primarily positive, can have second-order scary or negative effects

and that can cause various kinds of clamp-down / push-away responses, from mild awayness to traumatic compartmentalization

2022-02-09 at 23:29:48: @robosllim @jurijfedorov Oh my LORD!

I know the US words... for UK, I know... biro, abseil, kerbside, maybe judder,

2022-02-09 at 22:24:20: Parsec, cont'd

Soooo 1 parsec = 3.26 light-years or 30.9 trillion kilometers

It's... "parallax of one second" and is mainly used by astronomers to talk about astronomical distances based on observations from Earth

I don't quite get it, but I'm glad they like it https://t.co/ohUFl5J9fP

2022-02-09 at 22:24:19: Parsec

Guess: ohhhh it's the thing where people get mad at the Millennium Falcon man for making the kessel run in a quantity of parsecs because it's a unit of distance, not time? Light-speed based astronomical distance

Check: Yah, a complicated unit...

2022-02-09 at 22:13:07: Teraflop, cont'd

Check: FLOPS are "floating point operations per second", they're a measure of computer-think-fast-power

Teraflop is 10^12 operations per second

From 1997-2007, supercomputer world records were measured in teraflops

https://t.co/FiBVO7gm9H

2022-02-09 at 22:13:07: Teraflop

Guess: SI prefixes again, but going up...
yotta
zetta
atta
exa
peta
tera
giga
mega
kilo
hecto
deka

Check: Almost, but there's no "atta" and the tens is "deca"

Guess: "Flops" is like... operations per second? Like moving one (bit? byte? nibble?) of of data around

Check: Ah, I cheated - it showed up as a unit of magnetism in the 'degaussing' article

Also the dude who made the Gaussian distribution, related to Gaussian blur in photoshop etc

However, I don't know how "gauss" relates to "tesla", bc MRIs are usually in tesla units...

2022-02-09 at 21:46:27: Checksum, cont'd

The main thing seems to be, that a small change (error or substitution) made to the input will make a big change in the output of the checksum

2022-02-09 at 21:46:27: Checksum

Guess: It's a thing in computing! You do a thing, and you compare it to another thing, to check if it's okay or not! 
If it's not, you have a problem, probably someone has stolen your password or bitcoins or whatever

Check: Sort of...

2022-02-09 at 21:46:26: Boson, cont'd

Alas, no: Bosons are the force carriers; a photon is a boson

Fermions are the "constituents of matter" - an electron is a fermion

I got bosons mixed up with "baryons", which include protons &amp; neutrons

2022-02-09 at 21:46:25: Boson

Guess: It's a class of fundamental particles in physics! Uhh it's the bigger ones, that aren't fermions. Like protons &amp; neutrons are bosons? I don't know where mesons live

Check: oh, oh no. I hang my head, I have forgotten the things.

2022-02-09 at 21:25:39: Servo

Guess: You move the joystick / controller, and the servo mimics the motion somewhere else! 

Check: Sort of... I was thinking of servo control &amp; getting it a bit confused with "waldo" https://t.co/Dd3z0zfvi3

2022-02-09 at 21:25:38: Aileron cont'd

2022-02-09 at 21:25:37: Aileron

And also I don't have an intuitive understanding of how the parts of electrical current relate

https://t.co/djLrJFGc22

2022-02-09 at 21:06:13: Milliamp

Guess: Ok, so one-thousandth of an amp, and amps are related to volts and watts... Uhhh household current is 120 or 240 V, circuit breakers are like 15 to 50 amps, a microwave is like 1000 W

Check: Yeah, that's basically right, except...

2022-02-09 at 21:06:13: Femtosecond, cont'd

"femto" is a metric scientific prefix 

Just like a centimeter is one hundredth of a meter, a femtosecond is a quadrillionth of a second. 

It's very tiny! Tiny steps of chemical reactions are typically measured in femtoseconds

https://t.co/QLGrbIFboa

2022-02-09 at 21:06:13: Femtosecond

yocto

(grumbling, can't believe I forgot "nano")

2022-02-09 at 21:06:12: Azimuth, cont'd

Check: So you're doing 3D navigation in a sphere (using angles, not like a grid of blocks)

Azimuth is like the horizontal / flat angle ("how much turn"), usually measured from north

and altitude or elevation is the vertical angle ("how much up or down")

2022-02-09 at 21:06:12: Azimuth

Guess: Has something to do with aiming, lining up, ballistic trajectories, navigation, horizon, the position of stars and planets...

2022-02-03 at 18:37:16: @liminal_warmth @realtimeai Yeah, for me - wool socks help hold IN the heat, and they keep my feet from getting cold immediately on cold floors, and they're great in shoes

But they won't magically warm up my feet if they're already cold. I generally need a hot shower, heating pad, or warm friend

I've been doing some writing about [[the email problem]] &amp; realized that I'm often trying to come up w/ a magic way to phrase things so the other person won't feel bad

2022-02-02 at 16:09:39: @smallkewlhuman If someone's inclining towards non-coercion, I think it's pretty much always pragmatically necessary to do scaffolding moves &amp; kludges "in the meantime", to build up slack - and it's not morally wrong or "extra" bad or anything!

2022-02-02 at 15:55:35: @robjpalmer @AskYatharth @deepfates @m_ashcroft (that's the version of the customer service smile where they were actually just about to go off shift)

Also could be like:

"Of course I'll go to the thing!"
(internally: aaaagh but great-aunt martha will be there and she WILL comment on my weight and I just can't stand it)

2022-02-02 at 15:48:37: @robjpalmer @AskYatharth @deepfates @m_ashcroft So one possible message might be something like -

I'm open to being asked for a small favor right now, and I won't bite, but I'm actually kind of under-resourced in some way right now, so don't ask for too much, but also I can't say that bc I'm polite

2022-02-02 at 15:45:12: @robjpalmer @AskYatharth @deepfates @m_ashcroft And I do think there's a second level of nonverbal communication, something like -

I'm slightly uneasy! I feel somewhat conflicted about this! I'm not entirely comfortable!

Probably tends to make other people a little bit uncomfortable, even often w/o them noticing explicitly

2022-02-02 at 15:41:37: @robjpalmer @AskYatharth @deepfates @m_ashcroft Re: smiling while worried... I think it does have some (useful?) first-order social functions, along with maybe some less desirable 2nd-order effects

1st: Signals something like - I am friendly! I am non-threatening! I am polite!

(or at least - "I am *trying*!")

2022-02-02 at 15:37:49: @robjpalmer @AskYatharth @deepfates ^ solid take!

(and maybe difficult to actually translate into how to untangle conflicting layers on top of non-doing smiling, maybe @m_ashcroft 's course puts it more into practice)

2022-02-02 at 15:23:49: @RichDecibels (The writing is all at the roam link in prev tweet) 

I replied to one thing from last Sept &amp; one from Feb - and the Feb message led to a very understanding reply and a fun, energizing catch-up call!

2022-02-02 at 15:22:13: @RichDecibels I saw a tweet the other day that stared into my soul

So I did a lot of research and writing about [[the email problem]]

At first, this was instead of replying to emails that had fallen into the pit - but I have since sent several!

https://t.co/KRoAW1g8dl

2022-01-29 at 05:35:19: @m_ashcroft @visakanv @sashachapin I was like - all yr friends are freaking out bc they never experienced intensely &amp; unpredictably constrained options before

You were born in it, so not only does this feel familiar - it's way different for the lack of control to be impersonal rather than personal

2022-01-29 at 05:34:21: @m_ashcroft @visakanv @sashachapin YEAH - I knew someone who had the reverse experience!

Early in the pandemic, had just had a really positive shift in their personal life, leaving a shitty controlling situation

Was feeling weird about feeling so happy, walking around &amp; smiling, when their friends feeling shitty

https://t.co/etl7PQmyG7

2022-01-29 at 03:43:59: @sashachapin I'd expect the first group to be... more dynamic, flexible, improvisational - for their plans to change as they notice shifts in their external or internal environment

More of a dance than a march - but still intentional, not drifting aimlessly

Also better at taking in feedback

2022-01-29 at 03:40:34: @sashachapin I'd expect the 2nd group to be "single-minded" but also somewhat... stiff, or brittle? Need to control the situation - although maybe they're in such a generally comfortable groove it'd only show up in extreme edge cases

2022-01-29 at 03:39:21: @sashachapin Sooo... I figure the 10% are either:

- Super untangled, actually deeply internally aligned, probably do mindfulness stuff

OR

- Lacking self-insight &amp; compartmentalized so hard - the "other side" of the conflict gets shut down so quickly it doesn't even flicker into awareness

One option could be: tell it to AI Alan the situation, and see what the output is. If it's a graceful bowing-out or hiatus that seems appropriate to you, could put that reply in this thread, or as its own tweet (not a reply to the son)

Rode a train pulled by a steam engine at a sort of... mountain cowboy historical theme park? But mostly I got a fleck of soot in my eye and was upset about that

2021-12-26 at 21:09:09: @ricvolpe @Malcolm_Ocean Partly that, and partly something about... it almost felt like the writer / director was feeling hopelessness &amp; despair about the impossibility of sensemaking and competence

2021-12-26 at 20:47:06: @ricvolpe @Malcolm_Ocean "competence porn" is not typically pornographic

... unless...?

("I've come to fix your pipes" - on the oil rig, so we can get these hydraulics working in time to move the platform before the storm of the century!)

2021-12-26 at 20:25:35: @ricvolpe @Malcolm_Ocean Are you familiar with "competence porn" as a trope / genre?

It's about people working through tough problems with skill - Andy Weir novels for example:

2021-12-26 at 04:15:46: @goblinodds Water &amp; electrolytes as a first pass thing? 

If you're not used to warm weather, you might be sweating more &amp; getting dehydrated

I like the nuun tablets, anything with enough potassium &amp; magnesium is good. Salt too, although folks are usually already eating salty food

2021-12-26 at 03:55:45: @olgakhazan Other differences: 

Doesn't work: spray-on anaesthetic
Actually works: injected anaesthetic

I also asked them specifically to use an "atraumatic" tenaculum (non-stabby grabbers) instead of the stabby grabbers - ALSO so much better!

(WHY do they even MAKE stabby grabbers üòñ)

2021-12-26 at 03:53:01: @olgakhazan IUD insertion - apparently! - is a LOT about technique and experience! 

My first IUD was terrible, years ago. 

I got a new one a few months ago, and it was ACTUALLY just ~20 sec of slight discomfort. I was astonished!

Difference is, this practice puts in 100s of IUDs per month

(in contrast to "Miss" for an unmarried woman &amp; "Mrs." for a married woman)

2021-12-25 at 04:08:09: @visakanv @AskYatharth @Tjdriii Not *unreasonable* but probably *exhausting* and ineffective to dwell on it

then you could reasonably infer that they're old-fashioned

2021-12-25 at 04:04:32: @visakanv @AskYatharth @Tjdriii Like, if someone sends an informal card to:
Martha &amp; George Washington
or 
George &amp; Martha Washington
or
The Washingtons
-- then whatever, they didn't sign up for this, don't read into it

2021-12-25 at 04:03:29: @visakanv @AskYatharth @Tjdriii So -- yes, totally...

&amp; at the same time: I say that people who go for that level of formality on cards ("Miss" instead of just Firstname Lastname) are actually signing up for playing little picky social signaling games

2021-12-13 at 21:28:28: @dispirateparts I think maybe... it's the publicness of it?

With in-person kvetching, I imagine there's a bit more "we're all here to kvetch!" (less random passers-by) and maybe more calibration to what bigness of complaint the context is ready to receive right then

2021-12-03 at 18:59:50: @max1231235564 @gregbglw Maybe go with a partner who sets up "base camp" (with warmth, food, shelter, etc), and then you go a little ways further out for your vision quest? 

Then you've got solo space to get real weird, but you've also got backup if it gets TOO weird

2021-12-03 at 18:57:56: @max1231235564 @gregbglw Haven't done it myself, but would also second the advice to have a lifeline of some kind. At least somebody who knows in detail where you plan to go &amp; when you're expecting to be back. Maybe also an emergency beacon/messenger if no cell signal:

2021-12-03 at 05:14:05: @VictoryIllinois @aspiringpeasant @HundredthIdiot Ah, completing that thought - where supply chains are indeed fragile, and being able to scale up gardening &amp; livestock is a great resource

2021-12-03 at 05:13:00: @VictoryIllinois @aspiringpeasant @HundredthIdiot Deep in a LARP mindset, someone could lose sight of their present-day priorities &amp; economic trade-offs. 

At the same time - if you're too afraid of LARPing, partial solutions, &amp; "in the meantime" -- you could lose the long-term perspective where supply chains are indeed fragile!

2021-12-03 at 05:09:34: @VictoryIllinois @aspiringpeasant @HundredthIdiot "Wait. This is, what, $30 of canned tomatoes from the store? That's maybe 20 min of tech work. 

We're not actually going to starve this winter. If I need to throw some of these üçÖon the compost pile, I can do that."

2021-12-03 at 05:05:26: @VictoryIllinois @aspiringpeasant @HundredthIdiot I'm imagining a scene where someone's got a pile of super overripe tomatoes that need to be canned tonight, but they also need to finish a presentation for their tech job tomorrow --- 

and they have this momentary, "We're not gonna survive the winter unless--!"

&amp; then realize--

2021-12-03 at 04:55:09: @VictoryIllinois @aspiringpeasant @HundredthIdiot I'm on Team Embrace the LARP, &amp; also I think most of the "LARPing" takes aren't about LARPing the activities themselves (gardening, livestock, etc). 

It's about LARPing the *framing* of those activities as "living off the land" / total self-sufficiency, when that's not the case

Tree forts are often built by (or in collaboration with) the people who use them, &amp; generally lend themselves to being modified, added on to, used in new ways, etc.

2021-11-09 at 03:31:05: @edelwax Interesting! I talked about this with @LordChisholm... one thing that came to mind is that playgrounds often lack some of the features I'd want in community, including something about catalyzing agency &amp; building skills to change the space itself

2021-11-06 at 22:06:11: @reconfigurthing Often overlooked: It can be really great to have a place to lay down on a yoga mat, optionally also with a foam roller or lacrosse balls. 

If you get back tension etc, you can lay down &amp; invite your body to feel supported by the ground, invite tense muscles to reorganize

2021-11-06 at 22:03:36: @NatoBeans @reconfigurthing - Body load (nausea, trouble balancing)
- Dark room, singing/chanting - when it works, it's great; when someone is struggling, it can be hard to get some quiet space to reorient &amp; ground
- Shaman may be apt to blow smoke / perfume in your face if you're having a difficult time

2021-11-06 at 22:03:02: @NatoBeans @reconfigurthing If someone has no prior experience with psychedelics, I actually think ayahuasca can be a challenging place to start.

My read on outfit is "guy who put thought into his clothes, solid choices."

If the vacuum is a particular problem for you, maybe try making the holes slightly bigger, like 3mm instead of 1mm?

2021-10-24 at 16:04:12: @quotidiania Huh! I wonder if they came up stronger at night, either bc:

- you didn't have daytime activities to distract yourself from background feelings

- when relaxing your body to try &amp; sleep, you let go of the muscle tension that was blocking emotions from resonating in certain areas

2021-10-23 at 20:32:48: UPDATE: Y'all, the internet done me wrong!

2021-09-02 at 01:34:44: @bastard_brian Do I need to worry about doing it by accident? (While dreaming, if startled, if in an altered state?)

Do I have quasi-tactile "feedback" from objects I'm controlling? (Can I tell if touches the ground, etc?)

Can I train reflex actions? Can I do more fancy "programming"?

2021-09-02 at 01:29:47: @bastard_brian What're the limits? Does the "oomph" run down?

If so, any way to recharge? To expand capacity over time?

Are there side effects?

2021-09-02 at 01:27:41: @bastard_brian I'd test the scope &amp; scale - how big / heavy of an object can I move? How far and fast? How fine is my control? Can I move myself? (Flying!)

Does it work through microscope? Binoculars? Telescope? Video feed? Eyes closed?

Multiple objects at once? Amorphous - sand, water, air?

2021-09-01 at 19:11:17: @the_wilderless Huh! Do you think the No-Judgment Zone tended to nudge them further in that direction, or was it a more like a space they could kind of... take a break, or even reflect on what they were doing?

2021-08-27 at 23:10:11: @QiaochuYuan If super super squishy, not at all sour, and sweet-verging-on-bleh, they might be fermenting. I don't like the taste at that point (unless deliberately fermented into wine under appropriate conditions)

2021-08-27 at 23:07:43: @QiaochuYuan Yes, they're blackberries, genus Rubus. Closest other thing is a black raspberry, also tasty.

If one of the berries tastes like weird bad cucumber it's because of stinkbugs, happens sometimes. I usually just go 'bleh' and spit that one out

2021-08-26 at 19:35:14: @embryosophy I make a very-massaged kale salad regularly and like it a lot! I chop it, scrunch it with vinegar and garlic, add sesame or olive oil, soy sauce, chili garlic sauce, nutritional yeast, cumin, turmeric, coriander.

2021-08-18 at 18:11:07: @aspiringpeasant We've been discussing caffeine-producers (hardy to Zone 7) and ephedra (more cold-tolerant, doesn't like moisture). 

The rest need warmer weather... except, what's up with Lobelia? That's very cold-tolerant, grows up into Maine. 

Unfortunately, effects don't sound great...

2021-08-18 at 18:06:52: @aspiringpeasant I was curious about what other plants produce stimulants... a review of "The Psychopharmacology of Herbal Medicine" described this list: https://t.co/VGartakxCy

2021-08-18 at 17:54:12: @KalkinTrivedi @aspiringpeasant Oh, folks said Ephedra sinica - not caffeine, but ephedrine &amp; pseudoephedrine. 

Definitely more cold-tolerant than the caffeine producers... many species of Ephedra:

2021-08-18 at 17:49:32: @KalkinTrivedi @aspiringpeasant Yep, I'm not sure if there are any caffeine-producers beyond Zone 7...

2021-08-15 at 20:34:41: @made_in_cosmos Group ended up pouring huge effort into big flashy Burning Man structure; camp life support got the desperate dregs of effort, attention, and planning.

2021-08-03 at 01:13:24: Whooo damn, the third dose in the study was 59 mg psilocybin, equivalent to 10 grams dried mushrooms -- twice as much as what Terence McKenna called a "heroic dose"

2021-08-03 at 00:47:54: OH MY GOD I found it! AMAZING

https://t.co/wAzkRCddUr https://t.co/b0M63E4ZOW

2021-08-03 at 00:45:52: Oh! It was probably University of Wisconsin, Madison... and it was 40mg psilocybin, not actually sure of the conversion but higher than usual studies
https://t.co/WuBBggMQiO

2021-08-03 at 00:43:52: I swear I think they said the study involved giving participants the psilocybin equivalent of 10g dried mushrooms, which is enormous.

2021-08-03 at 00:43:09: Psychedelic twitter, I'm looking for an interview with a participant of a high-dose psilocybin safety study (I think in the midwest?) which also profiled the sitters. Can't find the link!

2021-08-02 at 20:18:06: @AstralPJs If working w/ a therapist is not accessible, Schwartz recommended his audio course as a starting point for self-guided work, says he considers the exercises safe / low risk. 

I haven't listened to it yet, so can't directly recommend, but it's here:

https://t.co/v5B5taFDOr

2021-08-02 at 20:14:30: @AstralPJs On a podcast w/ Tim Ferriss, Richard Schwartz said he has a reservation about the most common IFS book, "Self-Therapy." 

Says Jay Earley encourages readers to connect with "exiles" (traumatized parts) on their own, and Schwartz considers this somewhat risky.

2021-08-02 at 20:13:35: @AstralPJs ‚ù§Ô∏è ah damn, that sounds like a painful and terrifying experience 

Were you exploring IFS on your own? 

If so, and if you do decide to try again in the future, would it be accessible for you to work with someone (IFS therapist etc)?

2021-07-27 at 00:54:18: @CurziRose Huhhhh, that's a good way to put it!

There's clearly an important &amp; functional thing that a surgeon (for example) needs to do, which involves distancing, compartmentalization, and focus.

https://t.co/OQgns9exSt

2021-07-23 at 16:25:29: @MorlockP @visakanv @sonyasupposedly @kendrictonn You're right about not having aluminum foil until 1900s, starting in 1910 and becoming more common after WWII. 

Unlike other metals, it was hard to refine aluminum until a bunch of other industrial-age technologies came into play

https://t.co/pi5UhId9ml

https://t.co/ei0CLL9yXP

2021-07-23 at 16:17:27: @MorlockP @visakanv @sonyasupposedly @kendrictonn And then, tin foil (made of tin, not aluminum) is probably what's in the painting. It was available in late 1800s, but I haven't been able to find much on the history. 
https://t.co/Bv3iFQYpUt

2021-07-23 at 16:15:14: @MorlockP @visakanv @sonyasupposedly @kendrictonn Pure silver or copper foil *would* tarnish, which is inconvenient. (I think some metal leaf in craft stores is alloys?) 

And turns out, the tarnishing itself is what prevents other metals from making foils as thin as gold: 

https://t.co/mejVatpzLV https://t.co/GOFKw5KBQf

2021-07-23 at 16:14:08: @MorlockP @visakanv @sonyasupposedly @kendrictonn SUPER thin foil, btw!

"A gold nugget of 5 mm (0.2 in) in diameter (bottom) can be expanded through hammering into a gold foil of about 0.5 m¬≤ (5.4 sq ft)."

https://t.co/ZERjPzH89v https://t.co/4uqa1BylBw

2021-07-23 at 16:13:07: @MorlockP @visakanv @sonyasupposedly @kendrictonn Oh man, this sent me down a mini internet research rabbithole!

As you said, the art of making gold leaf is thousands of years old. Gold is uniquely suitable for this because it's the most malleable metal - can make the thinnest foil, and also the foil doesn't tarnish.

2021-07-20 at 18:42:34: @Malcolm_Ocean @visakanv @SeanMombo Well, and sometimes it's the goo tent at the prickle retreat! üòÇ

2021-07-20 at 18:41:21: @joespurpleshirt @DiamonDie @Malcolm_Ocean Might include shifts in various levels:

- Emotional / embodied (how you relate to it)

- Pragmatic (taking actions to care for nourishment?)

- Meaning / story (maybe reconnecting w/ what it's been carrying, how that was in the past, &amp; what's different about present context?)

2021-07-20 at 18:38:32: @joespurpleshirt @DiamonDie @Malcolm_Ocean And so there's kind of a dance of internal negotiation around, what does trust / reliability feel like for this part, "on its own terms"? 

Kind of like how people have different "Love Languages" or "Routes of Safety"

https://t.co/tuiD1vlDTV

2021-07-20 at 18:37:40: @joespurpleshirt @DiamonDie @Malcolm_Ocean Like, the part is curled tight around a crucial concern for wellbeing, had very limited options to care for this in the past, and was forced into conflict with desperate strategies from other (also concerned &amp; constrained) parts

2021-07-20 at 18:37:25: @joespurpleshirt @DiamonDie When I think about panicked parts, there's something about the phrase "on its own terms"... (which @Malcolm_Ocean has also been working with and exploring)

2021-07-20 at 18:35:59: @joespurpleshirt @DiamonDie And yes, the "trust" part seems key... maybe like, gradually building up experiences of you as a reliable mediator bt what gut needs (regular rhythm of nourishment) &amp; what this part needs (survival, calorie-dense, right now!)?

2021-07-20 at 18:22:59: @joespurpleshirt @DiamonDie Oh wow, this makes a lot of sense!

2021-07-19 at 17:59:30: @made_in_cosmos @Malcolm_Ocean @artpi and (more relevant to interpersonal interactions, but I'm sure it also spirals out into policy justifications) - most people are also working with a LOT of training data where their real reasons were ignored, rejected, shamed, punished, etc in childhood

2021-07-19 at 00:01:52: @_exoconnor Yes, people sure do... the ratio is the thing, though. 

It's not just "inhale carbon dioxide" and then some room air - it's "inhale one breath of 35% carbon dioxide + 65% oxygen". 

So that involves mixing 2 gases plus some way of measuring / regulating them.

2021-07-18 at 23:59:30: @QiaochuYuan Ah, but that one wants to give you the whole list at once! I don't want to see that, because then I'll be thinking ahead about the other tasks - I want to see just one number at a time.

2021-07-17 at 19:16:35: @joespurpleshirt Having go-to grounding exercises that work for you can help: 

https://t.co/IR9vx6wOi1

2021-07-17 at 19:15:58: @joespurpleshirt 'but if I DON'T let myself feel that, then I'll remain competent &amp; can protect myself'

Just one of many many possible feeling-beliefs.

Whatever it is, might help to build trust with yourself that you can dip just a toe into the sensations &amp; then back off

2021-07-17 at 19:13:53: @joespurpleshirt If you feel a big "NOPE!" to the experience / sensations of fear, might be that part of you thinks there's something unsafe / not okay about the fear itself?

Like, 'if I feel this tension in shoulders &amp; wobbly feel in gut, then I'll freeze up, &amp; then something bad will happen'

2021-07-17 at 19:12:54: @joespurpleshirt What happens when you get close to feeling fear? How do you know that you have resistance to it, &amp; what happens instead? 

(like, do you veer off into doing something else, do you get foggy/confused, etc)

2021-07-17 at 18:53:16: @FakkaFranz @nickcammarata Here's an example of 1960s research on psychedelics &amp; creativity - different substance (mescaline), but people had periods of higher capacity than their normal baseline. 

Erowid calls the dose "common" - maybe equiv to a little less than 100 mcg LSD

2021-07-17 at 18:48:37: @FakkaFranz @nickcammarata As pranab said, an LSD experience could put someone at any point on that scale of being incapactated. Mostly depends on dose, but also varies with what's happening around them physically &amp; in their internal mental / emotional space.

2021-07-16 at 03:46:46: @GabrielFox_1 @QiaochuYuan Also, (A) - the monk think - is very very unlike how most people live, and I wouldn't necessarily expect that experience to have much to do with relating to people who are getting ground down by scarcity. 

AFAIK monasteries tend to have plain but sufficient food?

2021-07-16 at 03:43:13: @GabrielFox_1 @QiaochuYuan - feel visceral anger / fear / despair / shame about the rough choices you made &amp; the unchosen systemic factors that forced you into this position

...then those are things Qiaochu CAN'T choose voluntarily while his parents care about his wellbeing and have the $ to support him

2021-07-16 at 03:41:25: @GabrielFox_1 @QiaochuYuan To the extent that (B) means:
- feel helpless in the face of scarcity
- be caught in a desperate grind and hustle
- be hungry and unable to get the calories and nutrients you need

2021-07-16 at 03:40:20: @GabrielFox_1 @QiaochuYuan I'm hearing a few different things, in what you're suggesting:

A) Live like a renunciate monk (~voluntary vow of poverty)
B) Going hungry and struggling

2021-07-16 at 02:51:48: Overall, I think that "pull smallish tasks out of a hat" was a good thing to try, and I think I'll use it again in the future!

2021-07-16 at 02:49:17: @DojinGarma Did another physical task, and then took a break for food. 

I found the last task somewhat more sticky / difficult / aversive, and felt like I'd lost some steam. Did get it done though!

2021-07-16 at 00:30:51: @DojinGarma Ok! Sent a message about a thing... ‚úÖ

2021-07-15 at 21:59:11: Ok, on to taking care of some sad cactus plants...

2021-07-15 at 21:58:48: Ok! That email's done.

2021-06-28 at 18:49:23: @deepfates @gptbr00ke @nowtheo Ah, I mixed my metaphors there a bit... hmm, a safety harness for working at heights? If while covering that terrain you slip - you're not going to fall into crevasse and die in agony. Instead, find yourself held in touch with basic inarguable somatic okayness

2021-06-28 at 18:45:21: @deepfates @gptbr00ke @nowtheo Oh, that's the thing - MDMA with therapeutic / shamanic intent is not fuzzy love blanket that muffles pain temporarily but then fades away.

Is like a life vest of basic okayness that adds enough emotional safety to work with material that would otherwise trigger dissociation etc

2021-06-28 at 18:30:31: @deepfates @gptbr00ke @nowtheo And then see through it, spring the trap and you're not destroyed, and in fact there's something beautiful and holy etc. 

But it makes sense you thought you'd be destroyed, bc hundreds/thousands of years of culture has worked by installing that core panic as handle for control

2021-06-28 at 18:27:08: @deepfates @gptbr00ke @nowtheo Sometimes you got to be with the "AH SHIT FUCK!" very unpleasant gut twisting heart rending shame grief etc to get at whatever emotionally imprinted belief structure is generating that "I WILL BE DESTROYED BY THIS" feel.

2021-06-28 at 18:23:17: @deepfates @gptbr00ke @nowtheo But if you mean "feel bad" as in "experience intense unpleasant sensations as part of untangling emotional schemas" then, yeah, totally.

2021-06-28 at 18:18:47: @deepfates @gptbr00ke @nowtheo Oh, unless we have different meanings for "feel bad" - I was interpreting that as "chronic dissonance, tangles, frustration, suffering, and inhibition of actions that would resolve errors in your perceptual set points bc they're gridlocked with other perceived needs"

2021-06-28 at 18:13:52: @deepfates @gptbr00ke @nowtheo Hmm... Seems to me, if that was the experience everyone had with mushrooms, they would be about as popular as that antimalarial that gives people nightmares and psychosis

2021-06-27 at 20:43:32: @hormeze @the_aiju And also, what's important about clinging to the feeling? Might be something like,

"I have to stay angry or else I'll forget how sucky this was and I'll get hurt again!"

2021-06-26 at 18:54:00: aw CRAP

it is UNLIKE an etch a sketch

because to draw a circle on an etch a sketch you don't do two circles on the dials - you have to change speed and direction on each one, like there's parts where the motion is briefly all vertical or all horizontal

https://t.co/nYuN8GZlTn

2021-06-26 at 18:44:40: oh naw you can turn the dials a bunch, and people have made etch a sketch machines, so it would be very straightforward to do this with that equipment:

https://t.co/4RStm1Uz4g

2021-06-26 at 18:41:45: what! has no one made a programmable mechanical twiddly thing to generate lissajous curves on an etch a sketch??

this is the closest I could find: https://t.co/uzdiIojx76

...oh wait, maybe you can't turn the dials around in circles? been a while since I used one

2021-06-26 at 18:33:01: there is probably also Stuff about things that start with "eigen-" -- but as yet I sort of fear to tread

would love ELI5 material about harmonics, because I want at some point to put together an explainer series for "connectome-specific harmonic waves"

https://t.co/yp1JdJcwc3

2021-06-26 at 18:30:03: It's uh... like an etch-a-sketch in terms of, one dial controls the vertical movement and one controls the horizontal

but also it's a repeating pattern of movement, so it's about how the two speeds relate

there is probably Stuff About Trigonometry in here

You're actually the only dev bio person I'm following - I figured this question would be relevant for your research, but had no idea that you did your PhD on this specific question!

2021-06-26 at 01:59:17: @Meaningness @tummycom @drmichaellevin Ah, I was thinking of you as well! 

I'm guessing the answers he gets will vary a lot among different Buddhists... might find some useful orientation in your critique of "Buddhist ethics" from Tantra, Dzogchen, and developmental perspectives:

https://t.co/5Zbxze7d7S

2021-06-26 at 01:48:59: @diviacaroline .@drmichaellevin is this something you study? 

Divia's wondering about what causes consistent left-right body symmetry breaking in most humans, but situs inversus in a few. Seems it boils down to cilia turning counterclockwise, but then... why that?

2021-06-26 at 01:44:24: @diviacaroline @pmathies @johncarlosbaez @ejenk Yeah! If the cilia aren't working, it's a 50-50 chance whether they end up with situs inversus or the usual orientation

(based on about 5 minutes of reading papers including this one)

2021-06-23 at 03:46:56: @PeterW__ @nickcammarata @deepfates Factors that could contribute to "breakthrough":

- Less frequent, higher doses 
- Inward focus (eyeshades, music) 
- Preparation &amp; integration involving therapy, parts work, somatic, shadow, trauma healing, etc
- Shamanic or ritual setting

2021-06-23 at 03:42:58: @PeterW__ @nickcammarata @deepfates So you might want to decide whether you're aiming more for "good" or "breakthrough" (not that you can aim super reliably!)

Safe pleasant setting + good tripsitter helps w/ both

Lower dose + chill fun activity (nature, music) aims for "good"

2021-06-23 at 03:38:32: @PeterW__ @nickcammarata @deepfates But you could end up with folks going back to the "shaking" step again &amp; again when nothing is ripe for clearing. 

Best case, festival culture - pleasant / odd trips, weird colors, etc 

Worse case, "conspirituality" - assumptions about the world get unglued in WEIRD directions

2021-06-23 at 03:36:50: @PeterW__ @nickcammarata @deepfates Most people keep stacking up the blocks (=psychospiritual stuff?), and get all cramped and tangled.

2021-06-17 at 06:30:11: Ah - found it before I finished posting the question!

I was like, "I get how moir√© forms when TWO grids interact, but that's only 1 layer of mesh -- WHERE is the other grid??"

This article explains: the other grid IS the sensor array of the camera
https://t.co/E4L728B5fQ

2021-06-17 at 06:30:09: ok WAIT - WHAT is going on here with this RGB moir√© pattern?

https://t.co/lQcFkCX8lq

This is a gate (that @Malcolm_Ocean and I made!) with a single layer of wire mesh. 

The colors only show up in the camera image - it's some effect of light &amp; interference &amp; camera sensors... https://t.co/Al9Qp6oOV5

2021-06-17 at 04:41:04: @Malcolm_Ocean I saw one fly to a branch with a parent owl, and then the parent flew off - to hunt, probably? That young one did the screams, along with some more owls I couldn't see. 

Also from a distance I swear it looked like a kodama - dark eyes in a round face, and weird head movement! https://t.co/vsXfMvlPlW

2021-06-17 at 04:36:53: Hey @Malcolm_Ocean I figured out what's making the rising raspy screams in the trees at night!

It's hungry fledgling barred owls!

2021-06-16 at 15:44:17: @pragueyerrr Have you tried talking some L-theanine before the coffee? It's a supplement, same stuff that's in green tea. When I take it with caffeine, I generally don't feel edgy / jittery / anxious.

(Also depends on amount of caffeine &amp; tolerance)

2021-06-16 at 14:30:51: @cognazor @Malcolm_Ocean Not just hopping out of one pan into another when it gets too hot -- because you know other pans exist that might be more convenient -- but knowing how to work effectively within each pan: using the right cooking oils, adjusting the temperature, etc.

2021-06-16 at 14:30:44: @cognazor @Malcolm_Ocean Yes. In addition to being able to use (for example) cast iron, nonstick, or wok-style skillets, there's an additional level of discernment and experience needed...

https://t.co/qRRlvNrkTD

2021-06-15 at 21:09:49: @rmpars Main reason it was more intense than weeks of ayahuasca is that I couldn't get any breaks from the intensity of the experience. It never turned off, until it finally tapered back to baseline. At least in the jungle, I could sleep and eat fairly normally between ceremonies.

2021-06-15 at 21:05:22: @rmpars Mostly, it was more like a loopy stimulant, rather than purely psychedelic... although towards the end of that period, when I thought I might really die, I did have some profound emotional-spiritual experiences

2021-06-15 at 21:03:58: @rmpars Two weeks of something very much like mania / hypomania, most likely related to brain cells doing weird inflammation shit due to COVID. 

It was a more intense psychedelic experience than 
6 weeks of taking ayahuasca every other night, during shamanic initiation.

- Bladder was relieved of duty, rest of me took on the care of my attention

- Set a 3 min timer, started replying to the DM. Added another 3 min, then a third set, because I was feeling in flow.

- Done! Going to bed

2021-06-15 at 07:20:45: This dynamic points to a lack of self-trust! 

Instead of feeling into the factors &amp; charting a course that feels good &amp; aligned, &amp; maybe discovering new angles along the way to resolve conflicts --

that strategy just adds weight to one side of the scale, w/o resolving tension!

- Part 1: Oh! I want to reply to that group DM

2021-06-13 at 16:22:05: @AaronEstel Oh man - chickens love eating bugs, though! There are some excellent backyard setups with black soldier fly compost bins. Or look up Joel Salatin's system at Polyface farm - chickens rotate through fields after cattle, get the bugs from cowpats &amp; kick the manure around evenly

2021-06-13 at 16:17:35: @AaronEstel And at industrial scale, males of breeds optimized for egg production are not going to have the same characteristics people want in meat birds, of rapid weight gain. Some breeds are dual purpose, good for both

2021-06-13 at 16:16:45: @AaronEstel Yeah, if equal numbers of roosters and hens are kept together, the roosters will over-mate the hens. Backyard chicken forums recommend like 7-10 hens per rooster. People can keep flocks of male chickens separately, but mostly they're going to be for meat...

2021-06-13 at 15:19:58: @DRMacIver @Malcolm_Ocean And I think that somewhere in the initiation and perpetuation of the dynamics of Moloch ( https://t.co/bll6iHWLrH) is this fear and horror of having to watch babies die of hunger.

But then the system pulls and pinches and grinds other people into similarly desperate situations

2021-06-13 at 15:11:54: @DRMacIver @Malcolm_Ocean *replace with whichever seed / tuber applies - "seed corn" is just the evocative English phrase

2021-06-12 at 18:22:44: @cognazor Not sure whether these specific mushrooms do this - I think mostly not. (There's like 1 paper about a related species partnering with an Asian orchid)

2021-06-12 at 18:21:43: @cognazor Ah, re-read your initial tweet about mycorrhizae - these mushrooms are definitely sprouting from networks of mycelium under the soil, but that's no guarantee that their fungal threads partner with plant roots &amp; increase water &amp; mineral absorption.

2021-06-12 at 18:07:08: @cognazor These folks couldn't find much info on effects of inky caps on gardens; some ppl in comments report problems if too many of the mushrooms overwhelm delicate plants

https://t.co/crctOvh337

2021-06-12 at 18:06:41: @cognazor Not quite sure what these are, but they look related to "inky caps" - mushrooms that dissolve their own caps into goo to spread spores.

2021-06-11 at 14:58:36: @TylerAlterman Protectors might be traditional to whatever practice you're working with (spiritual figures, guardian animals, etc), or personal (whatever resonates with you, even Yoda or Ghostbusters).

Can also emerge spontaneously...

2021-06-11 at 14:51:12: @TylerAlterman Silly transformations can be a useful option, but not always a good fit. Besides the emptiness / deconstructive approach and disengaging, there's also:

- Parts work (eg IFS, Feeding Your Demons)
- Calling in something protective

2021-06-09 at 04:03:30: @diviaprocessing Oh! I might like a bounty approach for something more like... person tweets their (relatively small scope) issue, solicits written suggestions / short video advice / exercises to try / stuff to read, bounty is like... reasonable for an hour or two of work?

2021-06-09 at 04:01:35: @diviaprocessing Ah yeah, that's the main pinch point -- it's an "all-or-nothing" approach, and that could bring in a kind of pressure that I personally wouldn't want in a multi-session emotional processing / parts work coaching situation.

2021-06-09 at 04:00:08: @diviaprocessing - What if you get to the point where, say, you've done 10 hrs of sessions, the issue isn't solved, and the bounty is only like 10x what feels good as a min. hourly rate? Do you stop there? What if it "feels like" the issue is 80% solved? (Sometimes very nonlinear, hard to tell!)

2021-06-09 at 03:59:47: @diviaprocessing - Hard to define relative contribution. What if client is doing a lot of solo work as well, or goes to a retreat &amp; says that fixed the issue -- but you laid important groundwork?

2021-06-09 at 03:59:24: @diviaprocessing What I don't like:
- Hard to define scope, as you mentioned. For example when I started therapy last year, I would've had no way of predicting the specific amazing breakthrough I had recently. (Do you get paid if out-of-scope good thing happens?)

2021-06-09 at 03:59:06: @diviaprocessing - Clarifying the "symptom" is the first step in Coherence Therapy approach (Unlocking the Emotional Brain, etc). Defining the bounty well could be part of the sessions

2021-06-09 at 03:58:15: @diviaprocessing Huhhhh this is an interesting idea! 

What I like about bounties on solving issues:
- Client is likely to feel a sense of ease, leaning in - no financial risk for them, they're not likely to stop after the first call bc "it's not working yet"
- Shared purpose / focus is clear

2021-06-05 at 06:51:54: @jongold If no experienced in-person sitter is available, an okay combo (for trips that are not aimed at intense trauma work or high doses) would be:

+
experienced remote chat / call support **for the sitter**

2021-06-05 at 06:47:30: @jongold - can't prevent or de-escalate various kinds of freakouts / urgent situations (vomiting in wrong position, person runs out the door naked &amp; confused, candle catches drapes on fire, unexpected knock at the door, etc)

2021-06-05 at 06:47:09: @jongold I think that remote tripsitting has 2 huge limitations:

- misses the lowkey standard good things about tripsitting (getting someone a glass of water or a blanket, holding their hand, giving a hug)

&amp; also...

2021-06-03 at 01:09:15: @jongold @embryosophy ahahaha

"trai na nai nai nai nai...."

2021-06-01 at 19:02:55: @quotidiania I haven't personally worked with this "Becoming a Supple Leopard" book, and I don't know how it relates to lifting, but I've known a number of folks who swear by it:

I'm also trying out SW Maps for Android to pace out some of the areas.

2021-05-25 at 23:32:34: @forgingtowards @Triquetrea (hognose snake plays dead so good, it'll turn back over if you try to flip it rightside up) https://t.co/h09BsO95be

did playing dead *work* in that situation?? üò≥

2021-05-25 at 19:38:49: @FossilLocator @CharmingGrump Do you know what kind? Stone crab, maybe?

2021-05-25 at 19:37:11: @CharmingGrump @FossilLocator Looks like crab claws

2021-05-25 at 19:23:36: @made_in_cosmos @nickcammarata *damn*

this is an excellent answer, and also OOF

2021-05-25 at 19:21:52: @liminal_warmth Er, don't touch it with your hand... I guess you'd need to separate it using some long-handled tool and bury it (or look up safe taxidermy methods)

2021-05-25 at 19:18:11: @liminal_warmth If you do shoot a rattlesnake, you could prepare the meat for eating &amp; the skin for desert witch accessories.

Don't touch the head, though - apparently can still twitch and bite a surprisingly long time after the snake is dead:
https://t.co/ZaZbDTaaTv

2021-05-25 at 19:02:56: @liminal_warmth I had a job that involved tracking and occasionally handling timber rattlesnakes for research

Was pretty safe, w/ appropriate gear (snake hook or tongs, bag &amp; tube system on a long pole, working w/ a partner when needed)

But I might not even do it myself alone in the desert https://t.co/cQoE3ji0pr

2021-05-25 at 18:57:49: @liminal_warmth Ah, yeah. I get why you don't want venomous snakes on your property... have you considered snake fencing, to keep them out of your main areas? 

I've read 1/4" mesh, 36" high is recommended

Folks will also relocate rattlesnakes, it's like $100 though: https://t.co/5kdz5JoCUW

2021-05-24 at 08:43:44: @Malcolm_Ocean Also the most recent Radiolab podcast had a great science story with this vibe!

https://t.co/ZpPGvL4Szw

2021-05-24 at 08:42:09: @Malcolm_Ocean The timing might be challenging... are you thinking that the vlogger makes the mini-doc as a retrospective, after the research is out there as a preprint or published paper? 

Or like, posting vids as they go? That'd be cool, except for the whole thing about getting scooped

2021-05-23 at 16:26:47: @Malcolm_Ocean misread this as "error-correction turnips" and I was like, oh god, what are they planning??

2021-05-22 at 04:18:56: @joespurpleshirt Some of these phrases are loosely transcribed, some are phrases that I've added. Geared towards Core Transformation, but relevant for any embodied emotional practice:

2021-05-18 at 23:49:49: @DRMacIver @ollybot_redux Ok, international screwdriver question: Do you have Robertson (square drive) screws in the UK?

I'd never seen them in the US, but they're extremely common in Canada! And many people will tell you the story of Robertson vs Henry Ford:

Mark Wilson - The Greediness of Scales
https://t.co/BljcaWwAqb

2021-05-16 at 03:33:36: @prosopognosia @algekalipso I think a lot about this stuff, partially because I studied stream ecology, so I know about physical whirlpools... and also because I really love the whirlpool as a metaphorical tool

I don't quite get the critique, actually... would like to understand more!

2021-05-16 at 03:31:52: @prosopognosia @algekalipso And I figure Andr√©s is critiquing Norbert Weiner, who said:
"We are but whirlpools in a river of ever-flowing water. We are not stuff that abides, but patterns that perpetuate themselves.
A pattern is a message, and may be transmitted as a message."

2021-05-16 at 03:28:12: @prosopognosia @algekalipso Huh! I also found this image, but I don't know where the combo image is from

https://t.co/ymdhs7hbhs https://t.co/HkIWkswFrs

2021-05-16 at 03:22:00: @prosopognosia @algekalipso I figured it was related to the poem - and searching for that brought up the picture on the right, which is Leonardo da Vinci, Studies of Turbulent Water

2021-05-16 at 03:17:06: @daemonhugger @kousik Do you use some kind of automatic transcription, like Otter? I find it useful for recordings that have big gaps of silence - makes it easy to find the parts w/ words even if the transcript needs editing

2021-05-15 at 02:33:05: @pervexists69 @liminal_warmth Ooh, don't think so:
"Leaf-footed bugs can produce foul-smelling, repellant chemicals if attacked or disturbed."

https://t.co/RxVbhERkpw

2021-05-15 at 01:58:35: @liminal_warmth A leaf-footed bug, genus Leptoglossus! 

Doesn't want to bother you (unless you're growing pomegranates) --  just eats plants, seeds, etc.

2021-05-12 at 22:14:43: @seconds_0 @orb_net @liminal_warmth Have you seen the runestone commemorating the time a guy hit a drone with a spear?

2021-05-08 at 04:14:55: @cromas @liminal_warmth If you're worried about mice, you can pack some steel wool along with the caulk, in the gap between the hole in the wall and the conduit / pipe. 

Mice can chew through caulk or expanding foam insulation, but apparently not steel wool. 

Worst thing about mice is hantavirus risk

2021-05-06 at 21:48:04: @made_in_cosmos (A google image search for 
body map emotions kids
brought up a lot of printables etc)

2021-05-06 at 21:46:56: @made_in_cosmos Oh! In an emotional resilience kit for kids, I'd print out body outlines, &amp; invite them to draw and color in how they're feeling. 

Maybe they draw BIG red spiky lines, going off the page! It's all over their head and hands! 

"Whoa, yeah! Sounds like you're feeling angry?"

2021-05-06 at 21:05:55: @made_in_cosmos I've also been experimenting with an exercise around creating a "Manual of Being Kind to Myself". Still needs some work, and the draft is here:

2021-05-06 at 21:04:06: @made_in_cosmos Yes it is! :D

2021-05-06 at 20:54:45: @made_in_cosmos Some of the body gear from this page on grounding exercises could be good, depending on what they like, and how big the "kit" is:

Also if there's a smell they find calming, like some lavender &amp; flax seeds in an eye pillow

2021-05-05 at 22:05:41: @jaywesley333 (whoops I mean toads mostly crawl but they can hop if motivated. also ranid frogs often have webbed back feet)

2021-05-05 at 22:00:47: @jaywesley333 Also some weird bois -- spadefoot toads, narrowmouth toads, etc.

https://t.co/2IfNiPlK5w

2021-05-05 at 21:58:52: @jaywesley333 The difference between frogs &amp; toads is not super scientific... if you're in North America, you're mostly looking at:
-  bufonid toads (warty dry skin, short legs for hoppin)
- ranid frogs (smooth skin, long legs for jumpin)
- hylid tree frogs (sticky toe pads for climbin)

2021-05-05 at 21:53:34: @jaywesley333 This good friend is a Toad

I have not forgiven taxonomists for moving a lot of North American toads from the genus Bufo to Anaxyrus, but... alas, here we are:

2021-05-05 at 04:30:44: @chaosprime @visakanv DOUBLE plot twist -- visa's golems actually have rich interior lives and find ways to weave themselves into the complex tapestry of human society, a la "The Golem and the Jinni"

2021-05-03 at 01:32:45: @AaronPogue @simonsarris I read "amaranth" and did a double take -- didn't know that people use the same word for big Peltogyne sp. trees and also Amaranthus sp. leafy plants with a bunch of little seeds.

2021-05-02 at 22:46:31: @meditationstuff Success in that role is more about presence in the moment, acceptance of yourself and others, and grace "while everything is on fire" - doesn't necessarily require a good memory for birthdays or high skill in day-to-day social etiquette.

2021-05-02 at 22:46:01: @meditationstuff People in that role are likely to encounter "stare into your soul" moments. Tripping people can be very sensitive to emotional states, and can often pick up on whether someone is, deep down, feeling afraid, angry, disgusted -- or grounded, calm, caring.

2021-05-02 at 22:45:50: @meditationstuff Mm, I want to say psychedelic therapists and other psychedelic facilitators &amp; sitters ...although unfortunately people sometimes enter into those roles without solid grounding in emotional &amp; social wellbeing.

2021-05-01 at 22:10:16: @coponder @Malcolm_Ocean Those are good ones! Is there any particular additional direction you're wanting to cover?

2021-04-30 at 07:15:49: @eigenrobot From wikipedia:

Midgley "had more impact on the atmosphere than any other single organism in Earth's history", and [...] "an instinct for the regrettable that was almost uncanny"

2021-04-30 at 07:12:45: @eigenrobot Another morally ambiguous scientist: Thomas Midgley Jr.

In contrast to the "Mistakes That Worked" kid's books, his might be called "Successes That Failed" -- leaded gasoline &amp; Freon. 

https://t.co/E6CdlBCCRs.

2021-04-30 at 07:10:35: @eigenrobot Hmmm... would be interesting to see how people would write a kid's biography of scientist Fritz Haber.

Radiolab had a good take on his legacy... he discovered a chemical process that now feeds half the world, but also made explosives &amp; chemical weapons

https://t.co/jTYGGaI0pl

2021-04-30 at 06:38:41: @imperialauditor @nickcammarata Part of what I'm pointing at is -- the things that aren't "bullshit jobs," in the David Graber sense. 

I don't think I'm fully able to grok what meaningful post-scarcity work roles would look &amp; feel like, but there are some useful pieces...

2021-04-30 at 06:24:08: @imperialauditor @nickcammarata Like, you might consider the conductor of an orchestra to be deeply needed for the performance - but that wouldn't be an "essential" job in the pandemic context

2021-04-30 at 06:21:34: @imperialauditor @nickcammarata Oof, I've been thinking about this on &amp; off all day - it's a really good question! 

"Deeply needed" ties in with what matters, what's meaningful, which depends on culture &amp; context...

2021-04-30 at 02:21:18: Free webinar series on trauma treatment, streaming next week:
https://t.co/dm024Vtu3W

I watched one of their other series, and it was very well done!  

To me, it's similar to why I took a wilderness first aid course - stuff comes up, and it's useful to know how to respond to it

2021-04-30 at 01:52:03: @Malcolm_Ocean @startuployalist Yes! It's this book:

Vibes: Huxley's Island, Burning Man, psychedelics, Becky Chambers domestic cozy spaceship details, Doctorow Walkaway weird-sustainability tech, Pern dragons...

2021-04-29 at 07:38:29: @nickcammarata And like, people are deeply needed, in the work of creating good places to be people in -- from infrastructure to arts &amp; the ways those aren't separate. There's meaningful relationship to place, to context.

2021-04-29 at 07:15:22: @nickcammarata Hmm... a future where there's abundant good Story, with less and less Hell.

Apparently if you harvest top leaves consistently, will keep going w/o bolting, from spring into fall.

2021-04-27 at 14:29:35: @acidshill If you want to try out stilts, you could also start with drywall stilts! Not as cool-looking, but probably easier to walk in bc your foot is flat. And you immediately become BIZARRO CIRCUS TALL!

2021-04-25 at 14:40:12: @eigenrobot @selentelechia (also I don't recall a boy ever handing me a surprise bug as a little kid? I was the one with the caterpillars, for sure)

2021-04-25 at 14:38:38: @eigenrobot @selentelechia Hmmm. But if he's holding it in his closed hand, surely it's not a bitey bug, or else he'd be getting bitten / stung / ouched by urticating hairs.

2021-04-23 at 01:25:25: Success! Malcolm figured out how to add sizing or other styles, to clickable image links in Roam!

(I'm putting it here as an image because Twitter shortens links)

People w/o edit access to your Roam won't be able to see the hiccup text; only shows up when editing the block https://t.co/1EovN23Uy6

2021-04-23 at 00:53:54: Oh damn, Twitter shortened the URLs - you do actually need the https:// in front of there

2021-04-23 at 00:51:19: @RoamResearch Yes!! From @Malcolm_Ocean:

Open in new tab:

Same tab:

Still figuring out img sizing

2021-04-22 at 23:51:48: @RoamResearch I made a bunch of pretty header images for different sections, but of course that just tempts people to click on the image instead of the link to the page:

https://t.co/GibpbYHd7y

2021-04-22 at 23:46:57: Is it possible to make an image a clickable link, in @RoamResearch ?

I'm trying to link to another page in Roam, if that makes a difference.

https://t.co/rAaQ5pHeou

2021-04-14 at 04:26:47: (Absurd mental metaphor for storing sadness: possibly the only good use of a charcoal latte, tbh!)

2021-04-14 at 04:25:19: "The sadness is really heavy... thick, black, oily."

"Can you put it into a safe container, until the next session?"

2021-02-25 at 16:52:27: @QiaochuYuan @harveykrishna_ Also it's very different to feed (for example) a logging camp vs. a hippie retreat, and then something like an ayahuasca retreat has a whole extra dietary thing.

Ex: psychedelic therapy clinical trials generally use instrumental music, or music in a language the participant doesn't speak, bc folks can get hung up on lyrics that don't fit

2021-02-17 at 00:51:53: @dispirateparts At that point, it's totally "magical" -- but in a ritual way. 

Not like the kind of kabbalah / wizard / programming approach to magic, involving putting together specific parts &amp; patterns while understanding how they go together

2021-02-17 at 00:50:23: @dispirateparts And then there's a *third* layer, where Westerners come and memorize the songs to sing in ceremony. 

Sometimes understanding all the lyrics, sometimes partially, sometimes not at all.

2021-02-17 at 00:47:10: @dispirateparts But I think - I'm not certain - that when mixed heritage shamans made icaros that blend together Spanish &amp; native words - I think the native words started to take on some magical aspect for them?

Excerpt from that Don Evangelino Murayay song I linked above, Ikaro de la Ayahuasca https://t.co/yYk7mTRwe6

2021-02-17 at 00:44:25: @dispirateparts I don't know to what extent the words themselves are considered magical, although they do use a slightly different dialect from everyday language. 

(ex: the word "pisha" in ceremony context = cleansing; everyday "pisha" is a small cloth bag)

2021-02-17 at 00:42:44: @dispirateparts There's something fascinating here...

AFAIK the Shipibo ayahuasca songs are mostly pretty straightforward narration of what the shaman is doing in the visionary / energetic arena.

2021-02-16 at 21:05:14: @dispirateparts The indigenous ayahuasca songs are usually in a single language, while the mixed heritage songs often pull from multiple languages. 

The Shipibo shamans sometimes said they didn't trust the filler syllables, like, 'He's trying to hide what spell he's casting! Suspicious!'

2021-02-16 at 21:02:16: @dispirateparts The repeated syllables reminds me of the vegetalismo / mestizo style ayahuasca songs

For example, this one is a mix of Spanish, Quechua / Kichwa, and syllables like 
"Ta la ra la ra la rai la
A la ra la ra la rai la"

(Lyrics start ~1min, after whistling)

2021-02-14 at 19:53:27: @nickcammarata @s_r_constantin @theorangealt @TheZvi For example, (re)starting the field by focusing on treatment-resistant PTSD in veterans and end-of-life anxiety in terminal cancer patients were highly strategic decisions in a longer-term vision for expanding legal access to psychedelics.

2021-02-14 at 19:48:42: @nickcammarata @s_r_constantin @theorangealt @TheZvi Mmm, keep in mind that published psychedelic research is still somewhat in its infancy, maybe toddlerhood - the types of interventions and the targeted conditions are still highly weighted &amp; constrained by what is most legible &amp; strategic.

2021-02-13 at 01:50:20: @meditationstuff &amp; checking for resonance?

I've had experiences of "internal charades" (for example) during ayahuasca ceremonies; whether I interpret it as communicating with my own right hemisphere or with some like plant spirit egregore, there was some very specific negotiation via charades.

2021-02-13 at 01:49:21: @meditationstuff Is the nonverbal part like... internal charades, but not just visual; also w/ feelings, sensations, impressions, vibes, etc?

2021-02-10 at 03:39:27: @nickcammarata @DavidSHolz Mm, I could also imagine other factors in addition to risk aversion. If somebody:

- has a lot of stuff depending on them 
- is running a highly optimized motivation system
- has very little slack or redundancy...

2021-02-09 at 19:58:16: @42irrationalist @Malcolm_Ocean &amp; people having access to an intrinsically high set-point for happiness might very well disrupt societal systems of carrots &amp; sticks that rely on (artificial?) scarcity of happiness, of the form "you can't feel okay until you..."

2021-02-09 at 17:49:23: @42irrationalist See also: hippies in the 60s in the USA

@Malcolm_Ocean "Oh yeah! They don't want people who are illegibly happy!"

"Doing alright" people worry that super-happy people will disrupt the systems that keep them "doing alright".

2021-02-09 at 17:44:23: @42irrationalist They've got something to lose; they're cautious.

But people at the top of the happiness range get very unpredictable again!!

From a bureaucratic / societal perspective (Seeing Like a State, etc) - it's actually not desirable to have a bunch of folks running around ecstatically!

2021-02-09 at 17:31:59: @42irrationalist Building on what Visa said, about "hurt people hurt people" - for desperate, miserable people at the bottom end of happiness range, their actions are probably more erratic, while people in the middle, who are "doing alright I guess" are probably more predictable.

2021-02-07 at 02:05:33: @theorangealt Also possible in jobs where it's a team effort without much slack / redundancy, and where one person being late or absent means the whole team can't do the job.

2021-02-07 at 02:04:17: @theorangealt a) Totally possible. Especially in low-pay jobs that treat workers as very replaceable. 

Ex: Amazon warehouse - 6 points &amp; you're fired, 1 point for 1+hr late, points reset every 90 days I think - so you'd be fired on 2nd month of being late 3x/mo

Or as a constant building up of FEELS and eventually FEELSPLOSION

2021-02-02 at 05:37:23: @embryosophy @QiaochuYuan @visakanv @bucketofkets @mechanical_monk Interesting! The experience of cannabis itself can be overwhelming for some people, but I can also definitely see how it could invite a very different relationship with sensory experiences.

2021-02-02 at 03:37:59: @QiaochuYuan @visakanv @bucketofkets @mechanical_monk Like, does it become overwhelming / disgusting to let yourself savor the moment-to-moment embodied experience of... 

- a really lush texture, maybe soft / fuzzy / satin, or flower petal

- a fragrance you enjoy

- a resonant song on good headphones / speakers

?

2021-02-02 at 03:37:20: @QiaochuYuan @visakanv @bucketofkets @mechanical_monk Hmmmmm

Do you get a "flinch away" response from leaning into other kinds of pleasant sensation, besides taste?

2021-02-02 at 03:29:43: @jackinlondon @QiaochuYuan @bucketofkets @visakanv @mechanical_monk ^^ I like this idea! 

Maybe this would be a different approach than the thing where "examined food sensations feel overwhelming / gross?"

2021-02-02 at 01:48:19: @QiaochuYuan daaaamn that was such good vibes!!

2021-02-02 at 01:40:51: @ChasingMyself Right, I think that in some ways of framing it, the "box" could potentially reify the destructive power of the triggering things, and contribute to a "pressurized" aspect.

2021-02-01 at 21:49:10: There's another whole question about whether the method is a good fit for me, or whether it's effective for any specific person. 

It still definitely feels like "scaffolding" - creating somewhat artificial / energy intensive / compensatory layers, as a stopgap before integration

2021-02-01 at 21:46:32: Then I realized - it sounds like "bubbling gems," from the show Steven Universe!

That's a metaphor I can work with - it's a reversible, harmless stasis that they use, until there's capacity to heal these damaged, dangerous, and valuable / loved beings.

2021-02-01 at 21:42:07: I had some hesitation in working with this, because while it looks very useful and perhaps necessary, it seemed potentially... disrespectful? 

One crux: Am I just putting "data" in the container, or am I sealing off / hibernating a *part of me* that experienced it / knows it?

2021-02-01 at 21:38:58: Here's an example of the technique:

Does it work well for you? Any experiences of dissonance / not quite a fit?

I *really* wish I knew how to describe this move better! It just happened a few times during meditation

2021-01-30 at 05:20:06: @selentelechia For me, it tends to be that there's a... emotional energy in my body, that I have to discharge before I can sleep? 

It's like this weird can't-force-it "sideways" move, and then there's this intense almost-uncomfortable sensation kind of in my core

I'm bitter because I was sort of forced to use it for shamanic rituals in Peru and I did NOT have a good working relationship with it.

2021-01-26 at 07:01:25: @peterlittig @walker_jjj @a_haema @QiaochuYuan Yes, that sounds like a very similar flavor - something about... feeling the abstract very viscerally? 

Some people get it with religious revelation, some with philosophy - the AGI stuff has the same fervor / enormity, but one difference is that it's also built on math?

2021-01-26 at 02:27:36: @walker_jjj @a_haema @peterlittig @QiaochuYuan Could you say more about why you wish I hadn't written it?

Is it something you hadn't thought about before, and now it feels really sticky, or...?

2021-01-26 at 02:25:46: @walker_jjj @a_haema @peterlittig @QiaochuYuan Ah damn... did I accidentally spread an install-able version of the meme, in trying to describe it? https://t.co/lypmB9SltG

2021-01-25 at 23:38:57: @a_haema @peterlittig @QiaochuYuan Also definitely, definitely because of seeing people being miserable and doing various, um... flailing wrenching social-emotional tangle-making moves in trying to "do the most effective thing" about the whole AGI situation &amp; get others to do the same.

2021-01-25 at 23:36:10: @a_haema @peterlittig @QiaochuYuan Yeeesh, feels weird to step back into the mindset required to write that out! 

I notice that, similar to Qiaochu, I was more in this mindset, and now I'm not so much in it? 

It's at least partly because of Dzogchen...

2021-01-25 at 23:31:19: @a_haema @peterlittig @QiaochuYuan The weight of responsibility... 

"Maybe we can slow down the path to this new god being born?"

"Maybe we can steer it one way or the other?"

"Maybe we can make a good god, and get it to prevent any bad gods from being born?"

The idea is, once it's here, it's too late to steer

2021-01-25 at 23:29:01: @a_haema @peterlittig @QiaochuYuan "An indifferent god -- crushing humanity heedlessly under its feet, destroying us in pursuit of its own goals that we cannot fathom!"

"A benevolent god -- solving all our problems, just the way an enlightened version of ourselves would want, ushering in a glorious age!"

2021-01-25 at 23:28:30: @a_haema @peterlittig @QiaochuYuan I said the possibility of AGI can feel like "a new god" will be born -- I didn't say "a good god" or "a bad god"  or "a god who cares about humans". 

Two of many possible feeling-narratives:

2021-01-25 at 23:26:15: @a_haema @peterlittig @QiaochuYuan Often, people are most affected if they know that humans are bad at feeling big numbers &amp; acting accordingly. 

Are they over-compensating? Ehhnnn... yeah, how about that guide, Qiaochu? 

It's really not as simple as saying, "pshaw, that's impossible!"

2021-01-25 at 23:23:52: @a_haema @peterlittig @QiaochuYuan The emotional weight of it can be equivalent to:

"A new god will be born, during my lifetime!"

This can make it really hard to orient to "how much" to care about things like:
- being happy
- conventional social / career success
- relationships, getting married, having kids...

2021-01-25 at 23:22:11: @a_haema @peterlittig @QiaochuYuan Concern about AGI can be very much an all-consuming background or foreground worry, especially for people in the social &amp; intellectual spheres around LessWrong, the SF Bay Area in-person rationality community, Effective Altruism, various tech scenes, etc.

https://t.co/7NryvbOSUj

2021-01-10 at 21:39:01: @jameslkent (I liked your book, and your talk at Psychedemia when you said, "Wait - is this about the pineal gland? I don't take questions about the pineal gland. Next!")

2021-01-10 at 21:37:33: @jameslkent Many aspects of the psychedelic community memes &amp; practices leave people open to conspiracy thinking, and encourage it.

I've taken a strong stand for clearer thinking in this area, and that integrity got me fired from an ayahuasca center for being "too rational".

2021-01-10 at 21:37:02: @jameslkent Ouch! Not my intent... in fact I think we agree on a fair bit?

What I meant was that psychedelics can act as rocket boosters for nearly any set of beliefs ("non-specific amplifiers") - there's no built-in steering or quality control.

2021-01-10 at 07:22:18: Psychedelic experiences are not a "silver bullet" for delusions, and they sure don't guarantee that someone will "see the light" of your preferred vantage point.

Context &amp; expectations make a big difference in people's interpretations:

Dunno if you saw it yet, as it's a preprint, but I figure you'd like to read the paper

2021-01-05 at 22:22:41: Overall impression: A solid paper

Glad people can now reference the "apprenticeship" frame for psychedelic facilitation! And the ACE / ACER model is great. 

Still wish folks didn't have to write in academic jargon to get published, because that shit gets real confusing.

2021-01-05 at 22:14:44: And another tweet for the "Embody" part, bc it's lots of screenshots. Good stuff! https://t.co/XijPjaiuHI

2021-01-05 at 22:14:43: More on the ACE / ACER model for psychedelic therapy.

Love the somatic work, and the bit about the observer self as being like the sky - the sky doesn't get damaged by the weather, no matter how stormy https://t.co/Y513z7pT6w

2021-01-05 at 22:09:15: Back to the paper again. I like their ACE model (Accept Connect Embody), and based on a webinar last fall it sounds like they're now using "ACER"  (R for Restore)

2021-01-05 at 22:05:22: Hmm, do I post this...? It's a public FB post from a friend who's now practicing art therapy &amp; psychedelic integration in Oregon. Recommended!

And... this last bit was reallyüíîüò≠ to read, an example of what I was talking about re: limiting models

https://t.co/u6D8HxBvQC https://t.co/CI3DW6Yh6H

2021-01-05 at 21:51:10: In scuba diving, there's no requirement saying you can't be in community with people you're diving with. That'd be bizarre. 

But that's what happens with the therapy model of psychedelic facilitation, because of licensure restrictions, and I think it's a damn shame.

2021-01-05 at 21:51:10: The apprenticeship model of psychedelic facilitation sounds like it has more in common with, like... the process of learning to scuba dive, for example. 

There are some safety considerations, and if you go real deep you need to be careful about how you come up from it.

2021-01-05 at 21:38:12: In contrast, psychiatric patients or therapy clients are not on a peership track, and aren't assumed to be learning the same material that the therapist did. 

(Although "psychoeducation" is a word used to describe teaching clients about topics relevant to their situation)

2021-01-05 at 21:38:12: Oh, ok! Now they're getting at the thing about apprenticeship, from the title of the paper. 

I like it! 

"Apprentice" is very different model from "client" or "patient". An apprentice is less experienced in a particular area, but has a path to skilled peership through learning https://t.co/uzps7A3Vgr

2021-01-05 at 21:20:13: Good questions, and an outline of the framing pieces they're laying out https://t.co/sMBelg6uMA

2021-01-05 at 21:16:04: Ohh, ok - "fatalistic determinism" just means like "Fate already has a plan for each of us" -- not like depressed or expecting it to turn out bad. 

In fact, probably expecting good outcomes, like "God has a plan" or "Everything happens for a reason"

https://t.co/WixWJIyAI5 https://t.co/EsJw8lm1cD

2021-01-05 at 21:13:00: There's a lot going on in this paragraph, but it looks like increases in these beliefs -- separate realities, mind-body dualism, "fatalistic determinism" (?) -- were associated with people feeling good after the retreats? https://t.co/EDTVbIKvt6

2021-01-05 at 21:01:24: Back to the paper!

They also discuss reported experiential revelations about the nature of existence, that can happen in the context of psychedelic research: https://t.co/zsCOIZIWI2

2021-01-05 at 20:57:42: I wanted it to be clear the savannah elephant was just as big in relation to the orange person...

and at the same time, it would be also true to draw the entire savannah scene as happening "inside" the orange person, in some sense.

2021-01-05 at 20:57:41: I've often referenced these comics, as another visual metaphor for working with emotions. 

Looks like they could be in conflict, bc the emotion gets smaller in one... and I think there's a both / and. https://t.co/y3CHFnMNSh

2021-01-05 at 20:43:56: Also, in real life, elephants play a key role in the ecosystem by uprooting trees - they maintain space for grass to grow!

https://t.co/1hnVtgWMd4 https://t.co/JGUyEjIvQW

2021-01-05 at 20:43:55: (How's the metaphor, @m_ashcroft ?)

In emotional practice, you might create this space through a practice like pendulation. 

Involves bringing the attention from body areas of tension &amp; activation, to areas of groundedness, and back &amp; forth

https://t.co/APK00iJbEi

2021-01-05 at 20:43:55: Big emotions can feel overwhelming - like being stuck in a closet with an angry elephant!

Expanded awareness doesn't mean trying to make the elephant:
- Smaller
- Less angry
- Disappear

It means giving the elephant a bigger space in which to trumpet and throw trees about https://t.co/aY4ZLGMVnb

2020-12-29 at 00:21:06: @liminal_warmth @cognazor @intershelterinc @FutureThinkers_ Usually needs to be up on a platform of some sort I think, if you need to run stuff underneath.

2020-12-29 at 00:19:29: @liminal_warmth @cognazor @intershelterinc @FutureThinkers_ Yeah, you have to sort that out for each installation, it's not included with the dome. They do have some photo examples of people who have made the interior nice

2020-12-19 at 00:15:06: @harveykrishna_ Yeah, totally! Sounds like the tantra retreat could be a great way to show yourself, "Yes, this energy is deeply welcome!" and then that puts a different frame on taking a breather before the ceremonies (abundance, rather than repression)

2020-12-18 at 23:39:53: @harveykrishna_ ...I think there's also space for mindful engagement with sexual energy, at least as a solo practice and probably also in relation, as part of preparing for and integrating psychedelic experiences.

2020-12-18 at 23:39:14: @harveykrishna_ I don't actually vibe with this particular renunciate / ascetic stance as the only way to work with ayahuasca.

While some people find benefits from that strong separation...

2020-12-18 at 23:37:46: @harveykrishna_ What kind of tantra?

If it's sexy tantra, probably check with the aya facilitators... many practitioners want participants to refrain from sex or masturbation for some period of time before and after ceremony.

2020-12-18 at 21:36:52: @sarelbic (This is assuming you don't have a dishwasher? 

If you can't install a full-size dishwasher, and if you have the slack to trade money for "spoons" / executive function, you could look into a countertop dishwasher)

2020-12-18 at 21:35:43: @sarelbic I think of it as like doing something really nice for my future self, and making it easier for my future self to finish soaping &amp; cleaning the dishes later.

2020-12-18 at 21:35:24: @sarelbic - Another experiment: See if it's accessible to rinse off the dishes right when you finish eating? You might need to buy a dish scrub brush if you don't have one. 

I find this makes a dish pile wayyy nicer to interact with - it's not even gross &amp; doesn't get grosser w/time

2020-12-18 at 21:34:30: @sarelbic That could help interrupt the part of the pattern where you feel bad about spoiled food in the fridge, and getting junk food. 

(You might even see if, after eating, you have enough capacity to wash a couple dishes?)

2020-12-18 at 21:34:20: @sarelbic Some thoughts on things you might try: 

- As a couple people have mentioned, get some disposable plates &amp; cutlery. The next time you run out of dishes, see if you're inclined to cook &amp; eat on paper plates.

2020-12-18 at 21:34:04: @sarelbic &lt;3 

Appreciating the way you're talking about it! 

In my experience, those first steps of approaching stuff with observation and open inquiry can really create some space for experiments &amp; understanding -- trying things out and seeing what happens. 

(And any result = learning)

2020-12-17 at 03:57:45: 59. 
- Neoshamanic ayahuasca practices of many kinds 

- Use of ayahuasca in clinical or research settings (ex: Jordi Riba's neuroimaging work involving freeze-dried, encapsulated ayahuasca)

- Psychonauts using "pharmahuasca" analogues (DMT + MAOI, but not the usual plants)

2020-12-17 at 03:57:44: 58. 
- Ayahuasca churches, which originated with rubber tappers in the border region of Peru &amp; Brazil. 

Groups like Santo Daime &amp; the Uni√£o do Vegetal combine very Catholic structured church ceremonies with ayahuasca as sacrament

https://t.co/xFQTzvqtZO
https://t.co/Qyxy5XfkvG

2020-12-17 at 03:57:44: 57. There are so many ayahuasca practices, including:

- Many, many different indigenous traditions

- 100s of years of "vegetalismo" or "mestizo" practices (shamans of mixed indigenous &amp; Spanish heritage, often bringing in some Catholic elements) 

https://t.co/pLpy0zp9s9

2020-12-17 at 03:57:44: 56. So am I saying that it's bad or wrong, for westerners to use ayahuasca? 

Nope! It's way weirder and more complex than that. 

First of all, there's no one canonical or proper ayahuasca practice.

2020-12-17 at 03:57:43: 55. Plus, the biggest difference -- indigenous shamans would have been working with people in their community, who they've known all their lives.

It's a totally different (and in many ways, bizarre) dynamic to have strangers coming in from half a world away, then leaving.

2020-12-17 at 03:57:43: 54. What would that even mean? 

In some "more traditional" indigenous ayahuasca practices, only the shaman drinks the brew, and uses the visions &amp; aid of plant spirits to diagnose the patients &amp; prescribe plant remedies for later.

Hear that? No trip! Westerners won't pay for it

2020-12-17 at 03:57:43: 53. But when that respect for tradition is combined with an inflexible, no-questions mindset, it misses the fact that there is no way to go "back." 

These practices are not static, and there is no "pure, untouched, ancient" ritual that you can go find to save yourself.

2020-12-17 at 03:57:43: 52. And -- there's something important to that! 

Shamanic practices are cultural toolsets, and there are many examples of people thinking they know how to improve an outdated superstition, only to find that the new method misses crucial elements:

https://t.co/lewYyDxJOr

2020-12-17 at 03:57:42: 51. It's common to find Western facilitators who are coming from a sort of "modernity is sick and broken" perspective, and trying to go "back" to premodern traditions. 

And they're often extremely strict about following the exact right steps to do the rituals traditionally.

2020-12-17 at 03:57:42: 50. Unfortunately, most of the ceremony holders I'm aware of, aren't necessarily open to or prepared for having generative conversations about this kind of difference. 

It's a metasystematic move, which presents a whole developmental challenge:

https://t.co/aFp5qYlTA1

2020-12-17 at 03:57:42: 49. If you find you can't talk with the facilitators about (for example) wanting to eat salt, and it doesn't feel safe to you to try on their ritual practices -- then y'all will probably have trouble bridging other cultural and paradigmatic differences too.

2020-12-17 at 03:57:41: 48. I will say that, if you really strongly object to the restrictions that a certain practitioner or center requires, then my advice is not to sit with them in ceremony. 

I see it as a matter of compatibility, trust, and respect.

2020-12-17 at 03:57:41: 47. The most common retreat center dietary restrictions seem to be sort of like a "lite" version of the shamanic plant dieta, but without the intention to apprentice with a specific plant spirit. 

So, I don't really have a satisfying answer for "why no salt?"

2020-12-17 at 03:57:41: 46. One example of a traditional Shipibo shamanic plant dieta might involve eating only green plantains and small bony fish, in near isolation, for 6 months or a year

I've written more about this here, with a link to a page that gives more background:

https://t.co/NVEzHsHr5U

2020-12-17 at 03:57:41: 45. 

3) "Plant dieta" for shamanic apprenticeship: Making a sort of "contract" with a plant spirit, to undertake ascetic practices in order to gain spiritual assistance from the plant. 
Ranges from days to months or longer. 
Consequences for "breaking" the contract.

2020-12-17 at 03:57:40: 44. 

2) "Ayahuasca diet" for retreat centers: Neoshamanic food &amp; behavior restrictions, for general cleansing / healing / making the body &amp; mind more sensitive &amp; receptive. 

Commonly: No salt, sugar, oil, spicy food, pork, or sex

They generally also avoid foods on MAOI list

2020-12-17 at 03:57:40: 44. @_StevenFan: Why no salt?

The ayahuasca "diet" or "dieta" can mean at least 3 different things. 

1) MAOI diet: Pragmatic modern restrictions, designed to avoid food &amp; drug interactions w/ ayahuasca as a substance

From this perspective, salt is fine

https://t.co/nNzqw70AJc

2020-12-17 at 02:46:03: @boxofgroove Ooof, yeah! I'll see how deep I get into talking about plant spirits -- there's a lot of background context for that

2020-12-16 at 07:56:16: 42. Secret facilitator food included:

- Salt
- Coconut oil
- Cocoa powder
- Maca powder
- Emergency coffee

I think I might have also had peanut butter? 

Yes, you're not supposed to have chocolate or peanuts, on the MAOI diet - and ayahuasca is a RIMA: 
https://t.co/nNzqw70AJc

2020-12-16 at 07:56:16: 41. "On the retreats, did the facilitators have secret food stashes??"

Absolutely, yes. 

We'd work 2 or 3 week retreats, and there's just not enough fat in the diet to keep your energy up, over the long term, when you're taking care of other people all the time.

2020-12-16 at 07:32:51: 40. Still, none of the food was salted, and we only gave rehydration salt drinks when needed (for headache, etc).

I was taking in so little salt, that my sweat was not salty. 

A novel experience!

2020-12-16 at 07:32:50: 39. So, how did we navigate this impasse -- a cultural &amp; spiritual requirement of no salt, and a pragmatic safety necessity of some salt?

Oral rehydration salts ü§∑

I mean, it tastes kinda bad, and doesn't season your food, so probably this fits the ascetic vibe? https://t.co/a8U1QMT8e0

2020-12-16 at 07:32:49: 38. But eating entirely zero sodium for weeks on end is impossible, absurd, and dangerous. 

You need sodium for your nerves to function. 

I find myself mentioning potentially-deadly hyponatremia ("not enough salt") YET AGAIN:

https://t.co/m1ySFLY6Ed

2020-12-16 at 07:22:50: 37. Hmm, what else... oh, SALT!

So, the ayahuasca diet is a whole thing. Multiple things, in fact. 

Before &amp; after ceremony, there's a list of restrictions on what you eat &amp; drink.

(I may come back to that - *much* more to say!)

One of these is salt. 

https://t.co/2z8sgOwrPp

2020-12-16 at 07:14:31: 36. I did NOT tell my boss or coworkers about the fluoride... because of course, fluoride "calcifies your pineal gland," and people who work with DMT are often all about the pineal gland. 

Not saying it *doesn't*... I mean, "brain sand" is a real thing? https://t.co/ESHoPzgsAG

2020-12-16 at 07:14:31: 35. Because, like -- vomiting is not great for your teeth! People with bulimia can get all kinds of teeth problems.

The dentist took my question surprisingly well. He suggested fluoride treatment before I leave, rinsing my mouth well after vomiting, and using fluoride mouthwash

2020-12-16 at 07:14:30: 34. A bit more on safer vomiting:

So, in 2016 I went down to Peru for the 2nd time, preparing to work at an ayahuasca center, coordinating research &amp; helping facilitate ceremony. 

This job would involve a lot of vomiting. So, of course, I asked my dentist for advice.

2020-12-16 at 07:05:13: 33. "Why the hell do they do this, with the purgatives??"

The stock answer is: ‚ú®cleansing!‚ú® It prepares you for the ceremony. 

The anthropology answer might be more like: hella parasites in the Amazon, gotta purge regularly, practical thing became a ritual.

2020-12-16 at 07:05:12: 32. Later, I went to another center in Peru, and they used a gentler purgative: lemongrass tea. 

This also involved chugging water to vomit, but it was wayyy easier. 

Mainly because lemongrass tea tastes fine, &amp; it's safe to let it pass on through if you don't manage to vomit

2020-12-16 at 07:05:12: 31. "Should I do this at home?" 

NO. 

If you chug too much water -- especially if you don't succeed in vomiting -- you could throw off your electrolyte balance, and this can kill you:
https://t.co/cRYbW9j35L

(Playing kazoo is safe &amp; recommended, though!)

2020-12-16 at 07:05:12: 30. "What is an appropriate kazoo playlist, to accompany chugging water and vomiting up soapy plant resin, in the pre-dawn jungle?" 

- Don't Stop Me Now - Queen
- I Will Survive - Gloria Gaynor
- Be a Man - Mulan
- Eye of the Tiger - Rocky III
- Gonna Fly Now - Rocky

2020-12-16 at 07:05:12: 29. Ok, so -- the kazoo was optional! My own addition. 

I figured: this experience is unavoidably terrible, and so I might as well make it more bearable by making it **absurdly terrible**

Bring on the clown energy! ü§°

2020-12-16 at 07:05:11: 28. I will not drink sangre de grado again. 

However, when I worked at the center, it was part of my job to give it to other people. (I would not do this now.)

I woke them up before dawn, in the dark... by playing kazoo ü•≥

2020-12-16 at 07:05:11: 27. It's not recommended, and probably not that safe, to let it all go through your system. Some people did and were sick all day. 

Forcing myself to drink that water was one of the hardest things I've done. Much harder for me, than enduring discomfort that's just happening.

2020-12-16 at 07:05:11: 26. Drinking it is bad. What comes next is worse. 

See, you don't vomit just from the shot. 

You have to force yourself to chug water until you puke, over and over, like a terrible frat hazing ritual.

2020-12-16 at 07:05:11: 25. The first purgative I took, during a 6-week shamanic initiation course in Peru in 2014, was sangre de grado. 

It's the thick reddish-brown latex of the Croton lecheri tree.  We drank it before dawn, mixed with water, like a shot. 

It's bitter, soapy, and horrible-tasting.

2020-12-16 at 07:05:10: 24. Moving on: PURGATIVES!

So, ayahuasca itself can have a purgative effect. The word usually means "laxative," but in a ritual context "purgativo" can also mean something that induces vomiting.

(Other forms of purging: sweating, crying, laughing...)

2020-12-16 at 06:34:17: 23. Where I worked, the Shipibo shamans would occasionally prescribe an extra-strength cleansing bath involving... gasoline, mothballs, onion, and garlicky plants (mucura)

Yes, those white chemical mothballs. No, I don't think I actually witnessed this.

Please don't do this.

2020-12-16 at 06:34:17: 22. I did not expect to write so much about soplaying! 

A few more "weird smells" things before moving on:

Some shamans also use strong-smelling items like mouthwash (Timolina) and camphor in their cleansing rituals

2020-12-16 at 06:27:38: 21. The agua florida hasn't smelled the same to me since. 

It's gone back to weird horrible chemical cologne.

2020-12-16 at 06:27:37: 20. He sprayed a fine mist of agua florida on my head, and to me it smelled like lemon petit fours. 

Same bottle, but a *very* different perceptual experience!

2020-12-16 at 06:27:37: 19. There was one redeeming experience I had, with agua florida. 

I was being soplayed by my coworker, who I felt safe with, and was also... well, in love with. 

(This was encouraged, which is its own whole story)

2020-12-16 at 06:27:36: 18. And I was hoping to mix the mapacho tobacco with a less-harsh smoking blend, primarily mullein and white sage. 

The thing is, tobacco is considered a powerful plant spirit in and of itself, as well as a sort of go-between for other plant spirits. It's a whole deal.

2020-12-16 at 06:27:36: 17. When I was hired at an ayahuasca center in Peru, I tried so hard to work with the agua florida and mapacho tobacco. 

I tried to make my own alcohol extract of fragrant flowers and plants, hoping it would taste less like death (it did!).

2020-12-16 at 06:27:36: 16. 
- Soplaying with tobacco smoke hurts my mouth too. 

It's a special kind called mapacho, and it's a different species from the usual cigarette tobacco, with a much higher nicotine content.

2020-12-16 at 06:27:35: 15. 
- Not all shamans do the "fine mist" technique!

One shaman spat all over my head, drenching me in saliva and cheap cologne, right after the most profound spiritual experience of my life. 

It was really a pure land / charnel ground kind of night!

https://t.co/fcuwr1X4Zf

2020-12-16 at 06:27:34: 14. Ok, but soplaying sounds cool! Why don't you like it?

- Agua florida burns the absolute hell out of mucous membranes! Chemical burns! 

When I held it in my mouth for soplaying, everything tasted like poison for *hours* afterwards -- even water!!

2020-12-16 at 06:27:34: 13. Ok, back to the soplaying -- why use strong smells?

Apparently, "The plant spirits in the Amazon love strong, sharp, sweet smells":

2020-12-16 at 06:27:33: 12. I've also written about plant spirit shamanism on my Roam "public notebook," including various ways in which people might relate to the "contracts with plant spirits" aspect of it:

https://t.co/NVEzHsHr5U

2020-12-16 at 06:27:33: 11. Probably useful to bring in more context on Amazonian plant spirit shamanism. 

Steve Beyer's whole site &amp; book are excellent resources, from an academic &amp; participatory perspective:

https://t.co/QpOyWtEdlg

2020-12-16 at 06:27:33: 10. There's a pragmatic component here. Strong scent can be a useful shock, like smelling salts, or an anchor for state-dependent cues (if you associate it with ritual, safety &amp; calm).

There's also a spiritual component, because of course, this is shamanism!

2020-12-16 at 06:27:33: 9. The idea is to make a fine perfume mist, no spit drips. You might blow it down the person's back, or onto their head. 

Similar technique for tobacco, but less risk of spit. You don't actually inhale it into your lungs, just into your cheeks and then blow it out forcefully.

2020-12-16 at 06:27:32: 8. There are some cool parts about soplaying! 

For liquid, you put just a tiny bit in your mouth, and make this tremendously forceful "TSSSEW!!!!!!"

(it sounds kind of like a high pitched sneeze, but longer and more mysterious &amp; professional)

2020-12-16 at 06:27:32: 7. Soplaying is used for grounding. 

If someone is freaking out, the shaman may try and snap them out of it by soplaying (along with singing, and using a leaf rattle).

It's also used to open the ceremony, blowing onto the ayahuasca bottle, ritual implements, &amp; the 4 directions

2020-12-16 at 06:27:31: 6. What is soplaying? 

The word comes from the Spanish "soplar" - "to blow." 

It's a cleansing ritual where the shaman puts agua florida or mapacho tobacco smoke in their mouth and blows it forcefully on the patient, often with a sweeping motion.

2020-12-16 at 06:27:31: 5. What is agua florida, you ask? It's... cologne, basically. It's mostly alcohol, along with water, fragrance, and coloring. 

It was created in the US in 1808. I'm not sure how it made its way to Peru, or why it became so ubiquitous among shamans there.

https://t.co/rXPwy0b5tr https://t.co/oZG5Y2RT1a

2020-12-16 at 06:27:30: 4. Potentially unpopular opinion: I loathe agua florida, soplaying, and being soplayed.   

The only thing worse than being "cleansed" with a mix of cheap perfume and spit, is having to put that nasty stuff into your own mouth.

2020-12-16 at 06:27:30: 3. To clarify: 

*I* overprepared and brought a 5-gallon bucket, the first time

I was given a yogurt quart, a different time, and... that rug will never be the same https://t.co/HM6MnRF0C6

2020-12-16 at 06:27:29: 2. BUCKETS!

Your bucket is your friend. Everyone needs a vomit bucket.

If bringing your own:
- 5 gal bucket is TOO BIG
- A utility bucket or trick-or-treat bucket is good
- A plastic yogurt quart is TOO SMALL - risk of tipping over!! (personal experience üò£) https://t.co/yeiGTDfXm4

2020-12-16 at 06:27:27: 1. I've participated in over 70 ayahuasca ceremonies.

2020-12-14 at 10:47:19: @BuildSoil Naw, a regular menstrual cup is like 15-25 g, a 60mL plastic irrigation syringe is 35 g. You'd need some small 1-way valves, connectors, &amp; tubing, but probably no more than a couple hundred grams

2020-12-14 at 10:34:45: @BuildSoil No, even better! Quick connect tube to a plain ol' manual suction syringe - easy to control, reliable; don't even fuss with some space toilet suction line!

Then just disconnect the suction syringe, connect it to the toilet, and push the syringe plunger. Done!

2020-12-14 at 10:21:26: @BuildSoil Use some of the zero gravity champagne flute designs to make sure liquid stays where it needs to be.

2020-12-14 at 10:09:44: @BuildSoil Oh man, if I were an astronaut, I'd way rather go to space with a menstrual cup than 100 tampons.

2020-11-28 at 02:15:46: People online said that maybe the new battery was yelling too loud at the little computer, and the magical flow smoothener just couldn't handle all that noise.

(Because, remember, it has the Slightly Wrong Juice in it).

2020-11-28 at 02:15:45: Eventually, the car started to do weird things. 

When it got too cold, sometimes it wouldn't start at all. Probably the battery was too old and tired.

But when I put a fresh new battery in, sometimes the speedometer wouldn't light up! üò≥

2020-11-28 at 02:15:45: In 2007, one of these flow smootheners got put into my car!

It helps the starter battery power up the little computer that knows how fast I'm going and how many miles I've gone.

2020-11-12 at 14:47:07: @nosilverv Maybe they crank it way up, get called "perfectionist," risk of burnout, risk of flunking for not turning it in.

Maybe they find that they can't ignore conflicting desires "enough" to win at school, and they scrape by but feel bad about it.

2020-11-12 at 14:46:47: @nosilverv And many kids, I think, internalize the rules and reprimands as guilt and shame, as an inner critic: "Oh, I *should* do this. I should be able to do this!"

Maybe they get really good at navigating the carrots and sticks. School system counts this as a success.

2020-11-12 at 14:37:02: @nosilverv Some kids go with flight (skipping) or fight (defy teachers).

Others dissociate, either away from the material (daydreaming)

or away from the parts of their experience that don't fit (ignore that your body wants to run, jump, sing; ignore your stomach; ignore your bladder)

2020-11-12 at 14:31:53: @nosilverv Hmm wait... I liked this and I actually think it's more like training kids to dissociate and/or internalize shame.

2020-11-04 at 15:36:57: For Oregon Measure 109, the health authority has 2 years to develop the program and define the license requirements for "psilocybin service facilitators." 

Notably, they can't require facilitators to have a college degree -- very different from the requirements for therapists! https://t.co/PJxJPF8BxQ

2020-10-31 at 19:22:37: I'm not certain about the effect on an "object level," but even the reflex to do this practice was a metacognitive move on some level, a semi-lucid reminder that the panicky feeling wasn't everything, and I wasn't helpless in the face of this distress.

2020-10-31 at 19:22:36: The other day, it happened again! 

In a distressing dream environment, I found myself automatically doing this grounding technique -- but I think some part of me remembered that most sensory modes were unreliable!

So I was (in the dream) touching my elbows, knees, ears...

2020-10-31 at 18:23:16: @Malcolm_Ocean @mattgoldenberg @Artiphon Mm, useful to clarify what you mean by "And no wrong notes" -- I think I know what you mean (none of the notes have to be wrong, the next notes can give a well-fitting context)

ü§îIt do be like that sometimes. 

üò£ It do be like that sometimes. 

ü§î But, not ùôñùô°ùô° the time

2020-10-28 at 17:49:04: ü§î Damn, yeah... if I had pushed a sales thing past the objections of some internal parts, I bet I could NOT take in feedback from other people without feeling threatened &amp; getting super defensive. 

ü•∫ Gotta get me on board first, then ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

2020-10-28 at 17:49:03: ü•∫ For sure. And we'd never know. 

ü§î SHIT! Uh... Is there any other way to be?

ü•∫ Uhhhh... somehow like try... it... out? Like invite a space where we could actually hear that from someone without biting their head off?

2020-10-28 at 17:49:03: ü§îDaaamn, okay! So if a friend was pushing sales in that way...

ü•∫ We'd distance from the friendship rather than give feedback, yeah. 

ü§îWell, shit. And so we assume other people might silently do that to us if we were selling stuff more loudly?

2020-10-28 at 17:49:03: ü•∫ Except it's easy to tell a friend, "You undervalue yourself! You oughta charge more!" 

but impossible to say, "I can't believe you're charging that much" or "I get the heebie-jeebies from those pushy sales tactics" or "I think you're over-promising on what you can deliver."

2020-10-28 at 17:49:02: ü§îRemind me why sales is bad, though?

ü•∫ SALES is big loud flashy car salesmen with big fake smiles!! 

ü§îEven... finding out that people you like are selling things you want to buy?

ü•∫ Oh, that's all right, then. 
Except...

ü§î?

2020-10-28 at 17:49:02: ü•∫ That little girl in kindergarten had a big fancy house and a big TV and even a covered hot tub! But it was weird, something was wrong. 

ü§îYo, for real. That was super weird vibes. But... didn't we also know poor friends whose houses had super weird vibes?

ü•∫ Oh, for sure.

2020-10-28 at 17:49:02: ü•∫ If you have money, and especially if you talk about it, then you become a target for shaming (you did it wrong and you're bad) and also guilt (so you need to give it away). And you make everyone else uncomfortable.

ü§î Where did that come from? How'd you learn that?

2020-10-28 at 17:49:02: üë©‚Äç‚öñÔ∏èObjection! We already took steps back from that, and also came up with the re-frame of: "Privilege is the capacity to do civil disobedience without dying".

2020-10-25 at 20:04:25: @SeanMombo Unfortunately, I don't have a particular recommendation for a VA company, so your Google search for "virtual personal assistant" will be as good as mine. 

This article seems to have some useful questions to ask:
https://t.co/XntVDckAYD

2020-10-25 at 19:59:33: @SeanMombo Generally VAs don't do stuff that needs extra certification or has legal implications - like, they could enter stuff into spreadsheets &amp; get your documents in order, but wouldn't actually prepare your taxes.

2020-10-25 at 19:57:41: @SeanMombo I worked as a VA for a few months in like 2015. VAs can help with stuff like book travel, schedule calls with people, some inbox management, research products for you... many kinds of tasks. 

Delegation is a skill in itself, and ideally a VA can help you learn that!

2020-10-25 at 18:43:16: @SeanMombo If you want fractional power-ups, you could also look into virtual personal assistant services. 

Can pay by the task, or # hrs / month. Better if you're matched w/ a dedicated VA. 

You might be able to get a useful % of that power-up, sooner in life, for a small % of the cost

2020-10-25 at 12:13:44: @GeniesLoki @m_ashcroft I do coaching, &amp; also have a huge aversion to that "snake oil" vibe. Had a lot of initial resistance to calling myself a coach, still get heebie-jeebies from "life coach".

Has made it a lot harder to do the business side of coaching / put myself out there / connect with clients.

2020-10-25 at 11:59:50: @humansarerobots I really like The Murderbot Diaries, series by Martha Wells. Has AI boredom, and goes into detail about what it's like to be this construct.

2020-10-24 at 23:20:32: @humansarerobots @m_ashcroft @maybegray Some examples of grounding exercises, many of which involve body sensations:

https://t.co/IR9vx6OpGB

2020-10-24 at 23:18:43: @humansarerobots @m_ashcroft @maybegray For example, I imagine the sun dance ceremony would involve extremely intense somatic stimuli, and likely an altered state: https://t.co/a8uxrzTuXQ

If a shaman is likely to do it (drumming, fasting, weird intense breathwork, extreme sensations), it's prob opposite of grounding

2020-10-24 at 23:15:18: @humansarerobots @m_ashcroft @maybegray Umm... certain kinds of somatic stimuli are often grounding, yes. 

Some physical stimuli can go the other way, prompting altered states or dissociation.

2020-10-24 at 21:22:00: @m_ashcroft @maybegray I also recommend hearty, salty, soup... 
Could either be a heavy soup with a lot of protein, to really have that nice warm sleepy belly feeling

or (my favorite) make a whole grounding ritual out of preparing miso with Sandor Katz' calming recipe:

2020-10-19 at 16:54:20: @AskYatharth @drossbucket In that framework, I imagine that cognitive decouplers would probably be more able to ignore layers of context that they didn't understand, and focus on manipulating the symbols in the specific question at hand, to get the right answer or to get to the next step.

2020-10-19 at 16:52:33: @AskYatharth I like what you've brought in about layers feeling shaky or solid!

Reminds me of what @drossbucket has written about cognitive coupling &amp; decoupling: 

https://t.co/YjbzzVFLFD

2020-10-19 at 16:40:26: @AskYatharth Actually, that's not entirely flat! It has nested categories (continent --&gt; country --&gt; capital)

Other feats of memory: spaced repetition, memory palaces, memorizing huge numbers of digits of pi, etc.

2020-10-19 at 16:38:25: @AskYatharth I think there's one variety of it that's like... quizbowl / Jeopardy / trivia style "flat" learning? 

Or any feats of memorization... for example, someone who is super jazzed to know all the countries of the world and their capitals + other geography facts

2020-10-19 at 01:28:54: @alt_visa Would ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAP) be legal in Singapore, with a prescription? 

Ketamine is on the WHO List of Essential Medicines, for use as an anesthetic. 

Doctors can prescribe "off-label" use for psychotherapy, at least in many countries:

2020-10-18 at 16:30:41: @mattoflambda oh dang

2020-10-18 at 16:28:46: @GeniesLoki @loudest_love So you train to avoid false positives, Type I errors -- and necessarily increase the chance of false negatives, Type II errors

Type I: 
A: I loooove you! ü•∞
B: You love me! üòç
A: Uhhh no??? ü§®

Type II:
A: I love you! ü•∞
B: Ha, you don't üôÑ
A: What? I do! üíî https://t.co/uUipknRSm5

2020-10-18 at 16:23:30: @GeniesLoki @loudest_love When I imagine that, I feel sad. I think I see myself in that.

And it makes a lot of sense that someone would learn that, bc the pain &amp; embarrassment of taking someone seriously when they're speaking ironically -- socially horrific!

2020-10-18 at 16:23:15: @GeniesLoki @loudest_love Well... for years, you've trained yourself to learn that "overwhelmingly positive" statements map to "ironic reaction to slightly frustrating or imperfect reality"

So your reflexive reaction will be to duck &amp; deflect: "Ha, yeah, sure"

2020-10-18 at 16:23:03: @GeniesLoki @loudest_love Because... imagine that's the established pattern, in a family, say. 

Then at some point, somebody says something to you that is heartfelt, and also conveys an enormous love / positivity / celebration / acceptance towards you or your actions.

2020-10-18 at 16:22:07: @GeniesLoki @loudest_love Mm, I can see some benefits of using "hyperbolically good" instead of "hyperbolically bad" when describing an experience of slight imperfection, frustration, clumsiness, etc.

And... I also get a clenching, twisty feeling in my gut, when I imagine this pattern playing out

2020-10-18 at 16:05:07: BUT -- it was accurate enough that *another* person who spoke Haskell was able to get the analogy by reading it! https://t.co/TVNcSUcfnY

2020-10-18 at 16:05:07: Now, I don't count that as fully successful, because I was jumping right into the deep end of a Haskell issue, and I didn't have the background knowledge to really understand where the precision points needed to be and where the metaphor / story could remain fluid

2020-10-18 at 16:05:06: Here's an example of an attempted bridge from the "gooey" side... 

Was trying to translate @mattoflambda's  "zipWith ($) (cycle [id, (*2)])" into something about glowing membrane-encased squirrels sorting nuts on a conveyor belt https://t.co/YNoF2J3qZ9

2020-10-18 at 15:52:27: An example of bridging from the "prickly" side: colorized math equations from @betterexplained 

https://t.co/eqiSPjaF1J

2020-10-18 at 15:51:30: Could call them "prickles" and "goo", using Alan Watts' terms (which are inseparable; the world is gooey prickles and prickly goo, "and we're always playing with the two"): 

https://t.co/rp5e20Oj5D

2020-10-18 at 15:51:30: There's some translation bridging needed "from both sides," from the explicit, unambiguous, linear, decoupled side &amp; also the story, shape, contextual, multi-sensory side

2020-10-18 at 15:35:59: @DRMacIver And then because doing stuff with code isn't tethered to physically possible environments, I figure it makes some moves easy ("Oh, it's 10-dimensional")...

but also you can accidentally open up infinite loops, or send things into the irretrievable void, or other weird moves

2020-10-18 at 15:28:12: @DRMacIver (And I guess even if it is relating to a physical system, you still have to build a *representation* / abstraction of whatever aspects of the world you want to interact with)

2020-10-18 at 15:28:02: @DRMacIver But unless your programming is directly relating to a physical system, you can't assume that anything will necessarily work coherently "in the background". You have to build the coherence.

2020-10-18 at 15:27:26: @DRMacIver Right, it's like... to the extent that your metaphor draws from the physical world, you can "store" the background coherence "in the world" unless otherwise specified.

2020-10-18 at 15:13:27: @DRMacIver Maybe it's like Richard Feynman and the "Green Hairy Ball Thing"?

https://t.co/m5sBjY1wZQ

2020-10-18 at 15:13:14: @DRMacIver Mhm! Or... there's something about the metaphors that I like best, where there's a kind of "click" feeling that has a geometric goodness-of-fit. 

It's not vague overall - some parts need to be very precise, while other parts are left fluid until their constraints become relevant

2020-10-18 at 14:59:08: Oh, I'm going to jump back to a concept from a few tweets ago -- this piece from Bret Victor from 8 years ago, says that the Processing language isn't in itself an answer for the thing I'm wanting:

https://t.co/ZJdsgEwlAI

2020-10-18 at 14:56:48: Probably my worst experience with coding was trying to go too fast through Hartl's Ruby on Rails tutorial, attempting to keep up with a class.

I was miserable. I had no idea what was going on, or why something wasn't working. Everything was totally opaque, and I was lost.

2020-10-18 at 14:51:20: Or, of course, interacting with code in physical space, like what @worrydream &amp; folks are doing at @Dynamicland1!

https://t.co/HCY478RDAE

2020-10-18 at 14:51:19: I'd probably have a better experience if I was starting with direct visual feedback (like Processing) , or was able to interact with the code in a more spatial / diagrammatic way (like in Blender, probably?)

https://t.co/SULhi0pIyv

2020-10-18 at 14:51:19: But I have learned large "flat" sets of information (like Spanish vocab), and I'm very good at pattern recognition that fits onto a tree of knowledge (no idea how many plants / fungi / animals I can identify... prob well over 1000?)

(img: https://t.co/7dvTYwRN31) https://t.co/EM9E0323V2

2020-10-18 at 14:51:18: When I've seen friends dive into pages of greek-laden math equations, or piles of code that looks to me like memorizing arbitrary rulesets, I've felt a sense of panic/despair -- like I'm just not innately suited for that.

2020-10-18 at 14:18:00: Here's that quote again, in a bit more context &amp; illustrated:

"ùòóùò≥ùò∞ùò®ùò≥ùò¢ùòÆùòÆùò™ùòØùò® ùò™ùò¥ ùò´ùò∂ùò¥ùòµ ùò¢ ùò®ùò™ùò¢ùòØùòµ ùò¥ùòµùò¢ùò§ùò¨ ùò∞ùòß ùòÆùò¶ùòµùò¢ùò±ùò©ùò∞ùò≥ùò¥. Each layer of the metaphorical stack moves us further away from machine world, and closer to human world." https://t.co/pWAIO3nbAo

2020-10-18 at 14:17:58: Excellent post about metaphor design!

This phrase really struck me...
"ùòóùò≥ùò∞ùò®ùò≥ùò¢ùòÆùòÆùò™ùòØùò® ùò™ùò¥ ùò´ùò∂ùò¥ùòµ ùò¢ ùò®ùò™ùò¢ùòØùòµ ùò¥ùòµùò¢ùò§ùò¨ ùò∞ùòß ùòÆùò¶ùòµùò¢ùò±ùò©ùò∞ùò≥ùò¥."

2020-10-17 at 13:05:25: @AvalancheJohn @lisatomic5 @Malcolm_Ocean I hadn't known about these aesthetics!

They seem to be very serious though, and monochromatic... perhaps more larping dystopia than weirdtopia?

2020-10-17 at 02:55:23: @harveykrishna_ Alternatively, how far are you from the nearest better thing, and what's the limiting factor?

For example, limiting factor could be:
- time to research mic
- $$ for mic
- time to research software
- (zencastr free plan looks pretty good?)
- computer woes
- internet troubles
etc

2020-10-17 at 02:50:39: @harveykrishna_ dooo it

2020-10-12 at 15:41:17: @forgingtowards Lol yeah -- pretty sure I came across as a very unsettling 8yo when someone gave a talk about reptiles and amphibians and I was like 

HELLO YES 

I WILL DEMONSTRATE MY EXTREME INTEREST IN THIS TOPIC

BY MY LASER FOCUS INTENT STARE

FOR THE ENTIRE PRESENTATION

2020-10-12 at 15:23:26: Kaj also had some tweets on theory of creepiness

https://t.co/dSGgEjC3yC

2020-10-12 at 15:22:13: A thread (up &amp; down from this tweet, plus branches) about deliberate practice in facial movements &amp; body language. 

Relates to autistic masking, and @meditationstuff 's concepts of layering &amp; delayering

https://t.co/0i8LyS9GjE

2020-10-12 at 15:17:23: @BuildSoil @libbeesknees yikes! good to know

2020-10-12 at 15:16:17: My reaction when he did one of the "creepy" demos https://t.co/qeX5TkI14Y

2020-10-12 at 15:11:08: Fascinating and very useful demo!

Ways of relating to the space, the camera, and viewers that invite a natural and easeful presence, or a compressed, intrusive, creepy vibe. https://t.co/xSjPnSDLRD

2020-10-12 at 15:05:06: @libbeesknees @BuildSoil Wait, for real? I've heard of soap nuts / Sapindus sp. being used as laundry detergent (the saponins make suds)... do horse chestnuts also do that?

*googles*

Huh!

2020-10-12 at 10:26:18: @m_ashcroft @mechanicalmonk1 @lisatomic5 People might not guess now, in casual interactions, unless I'm distressed / tired / otherwise low resourced.

I think that watching video recordings of myself will be an interesting experiment, will probably bring up some Stuff

2020-10-12 at 10:23:38: @m_ashcroft @mechanicalmonk1 @lisatomic5 Ah, I see people in another branch of the thread talking about autistic masking, and developing deliberate habits to add more expression to avoid freaking people out.

Yeah. I... remember having to learn body language deliberately, reading about it and practicing.

2020-10-12 at 10:15:29: @m_ashcroft @mechanicalmonk1 @lisatomic5 I have a horror of being socially forced to perform emotion, and try to shape my environment so that I feel a wider window of acceptance for whatever happens to show up on my face

(I'm planning to do the "100 videos" thing soon - we'll see how it goes!)

2020-10-12 at 10:14:30: @m_ashcroft @mechanicalmonk1 @lisatomic5 Which - I don't have exactly that experience, but I get it. If I'm not feeling at ease in a scene I often become hyper-aware of my facial muscles. Usually results in my face looking mask-like.

2020-10-12 at 10:08:03: @m_ashcroft @mechanicalmonk1 @lisatomic5 He was kind of trying to... perform easygoing high status neurotypical, but it was a layer on top of, like, neurodivergent plus a lot of trauma &amp; paranoia plus trying to do everything from the left hemisphere (deliberate, verbal, explicit, rational, pre-planned)

2020-10-12 at 10:02:42: @m_ashcroft @mechanicalmonk1 @lisatomic5 Yeah, I've seen a recording of someone trying hard not to be creepy on Zoom, and the impression I got was strong uncanny valley / bad face puppet vibes.

Talked with him later and he indeed often felt frustrated about his face feeling like a mask or clunky puppet

2020-10-08 at 02:18:56: @Malcolm_Ocean On reflection, I'm not currently committing to offering myself a donut for contemplating nonduality -- and I'm not ruling it out!
üßêüç©

2020-10-08 at 02:15:21: @Malcolm_Ocean Inner dialogue that popped into my head:

"Got a donut for any left hemisphere that can accept that holes and form are co-defining &amp; inseparable"

Immediately followed by:

"Wait tho am I actually gonna get a donut??" 

üòÇüòÇ left hemisphere is very literal!!

2020-10-08 at 02:07:53: @Malcolm_Ocean Twitter! Show me these things, that I want to see! 
Why do you not show me the things, on the timeline, that I want

2020-10-08 at 01:58:27: Also, as far as I've seen, if the method doesn't work well for someone, I expect that it's more likely to fizzle out than to explode -- more likely to feel "meh" / shrug, unlikely to leave someone in a heightened or distressed state

2020-10-08 at 01:58:27: And in terms of "how good of a bet is this" -- the method is based on a very specific script, so the main things that a coach in training needs to learn are: 

- General skills of presence &amp; attunement

- Making choices about when &amp; how to branch off &amp; work w/resisting parts

2020-10-08 at 01:51:38: I took a weekend workshop on Core Transformation last year, and this seems like a good deal!

I've been using other parts work methods more frequently, and am planning to take another look at CT after making some connections w/Buddhist frameworks:

2020-10-08 at 00:14:19: @Malcolm_Ocean Because for "what is therapy?" there's also this kind of bureaucratic answer -- it's not exciting but is important for clarification https://t.co/3Icbcz7RG0

2020-10-08 at 00:12:35: @Malcolm_Ocean I think you may be mixing 2 things here:

-- what do we use the word "therapy" for?

-- what constitutes effective or transformational change in patterns of thought / feeling / behavior, or in how we relate to those experiences?

https://t.co/BQPqc3yJDx

2020-10-04 at 19:19:36: @techgnostic Are you familiar with the Core Transformation practice? 
I can send some material via DM if you'd like. 

I don't yet have much about the practice itself in Roam, but I do have a quote about the Core States:
https://t.co/MU9BYhmowc

2020-10-04 at 18:50:07: It's very compatible with the juxtaposition move described in Coherence Therapy / Unlocking the Emotional Brain. 

Holding awareness of both "unlocks" the old emotional learning, and feeling the potential cognitive dissonance and weirdness of it invites the old pattern to update

2020-10-04 at 18:50:07: In Core Transformation, you bring the core state into juxtaposition with all the various layers of stories and strategies, back to the initial thought / feeling / behavior that was bugging you.

2020-10-04 at 18:50:06: And, you can do a both/and move, a sort of paradoxical holding both the experience of cores states (spaciousness, luminosity, etc) and also the experience of anxiety, grief, anger, etc.

2020-10-04 at 18:50:06: Bruce Tift's work gives a really solid response to "but is it cheating??" 

It's not cheating. You won't be able to escape somatic experiences like tightness in the chest, constricted throat, tension in the shoulders, roiling in the gut. 

You can get space from the story, though

2020-10-04 at 18:50:06: ** gestures vaguely but energetically at words from Dzogchen like "rigpa" ** https://t.co/CRnfTPvi6M

2020-10-04 at 18:50:05: It's like... not trying to get someone to "generate" the feeling of a core state. 

Because core states are defined as unconditional, it's more of a *noticing* or bringing awareness to that aspect of your experience, that's already there.

2020-10-04 at 18:50:05: I think that, in seeing how Bruce Tift (Already Free) brings the Vajrayana Buddhist view into dialogue with psychotherapy... 

that gives me a different frame to work with.

2020-10-04 at 18:50:04: And then the main reason:
- When someone says, "I can't feel that core state" or "Isn't this cheating / wireheading though?" -- I didn't have a great answer that I deeply trusted

I had some notes from the course, on what to say, and sometimes that would work

2020-10-04 at 18:50:04: Several reasons:
- Hard to keep track of the branching; I've tried making several templates or using freeform on paper

- I've memorized the Feeding Your Demons script, so it's simpler to reach for that

2020-10-04 at 18:50:04: You know... I wonder if working with a lot of this Bruce Tift material will lead me to do more with Core Transformation.

I took a weekend workshop on it, have practiced it with folks... and lately have been using other parts work &amp; juxtaposition practices instead. https://t.co/YWEjvJrlN7

2020-10-03 at 11:56:10: @spakhm (I like the absurdity of this, with the caveat that ayahuasca is far from a silver bullet for assholery and blind spots. People can emerge from the experience with deluded, grandiose plans; ayahuasca shamans have assaulted women, etc.)

2020-10-03 at 08:27:39: @HunterBergsma I would suspect that the flower might be:

2020-10-02 at 16:37:46: Take turns doing that, and it can open up more space for working out the specifics, with words. 

( @Malcolm_Ocean and I have been meaning to make a demo video)

2020-10-02 at 16:37:46: Just wordless growl, shout, nonsense syllable, etc.

Can be an initial practice to get some energy flowing, and to be seen &amp; received in the flavor of how you're feeling, in a way that's less likely to bring up defensiveness in your partner, because the story isn't there.

2020-10-02 at 16:37:46: Ooh! @maybegray, I offer a practice that might be a good fit here.

If your partner has space to receive it:

Try acting out the entire body movement, gesture, facial contortion, tone, volume, sound of what you're feeling--

2020-10-02 at 14:51:31: @gregorylent @visakanv @meditationstuff To me, annealing is an essential part of rites of passage. When you are about to step into more power and responsibility, it's a way to build non-naive trust with yourself, that you can work skillfully with "triggering" circumstances, instead of reacting from exiled parts.

2020-10-02 at 14:51:25: @gregorylent @visakanv One thing @meditationstuff focuses on, among others, is the way that even highly advanced meditators can still have compartmentalized "stuff" that comes out sideways, in actions that aren't in integrity with their teachings -- like the recent stuff with Culadasa.

2020-10-02 at 14:51:15: @gregorylent @visakanv (Or the perception of a crack.)

So from that view, a process of healing and development would not look like always becoming more and more quiet and tranquil. It would have waves of intensity and integration.

2020-10-02 at 14:50:54: @gregorylent @visakanv So for that,"annealing" would not look like the smashing or tearing metaphors you used; it would be more of a melting or re-forging, that reintegrates the "cracked" pieces.

2020-10-02 at 14:50:37: @gregorylent @visakanv I would add, that if there is a crack or fracture -- which would correspond with compartmentalization caused by trauma, or what Internal Family Systems would call exiled parts -- the knowing in that part of the psyche is not integrated with day-to-day consciousness.

2020-10-02 at 14:50:25: @gregorylent @visakanv Maybe it's useful to explore... through our accidental conditioned history, it could seem as though the mirror / crystal gets dirty, scratched, or fractured, &amp; then we act on warped perceptions. 

I could see what you wrote as maybe, focusing on cleaning &amp; polishing the surface?

2020-10-02 at 14:49:42: @gregorylent @visakanv Stepping away from what Norbu wrote, I'm going to try extending the metaphor -- which may be hazardous! 

I think from a Dzogchen perspective, nothing can fuck up the underlying nature of all that, but we can for sure think we're fucked up and get all tied up in knots about it.

2020-10-02 at 14:49:22: @gregorylent @visakanv In Dzogchen Teachings, Namkhai Norbu uses symbols to indicate how energy manifests through clear awareness as a mirror reÔ¨Çects light unconditionally, a crystal refracts light unconditionally, and a crystal ball appears to hold the image within itself.

2020-10-02 at 14:25:59: @gregorylent @visakanv Interesting! Are you coming from more of a Sutric or renunciate Buddhist perspective, with the highest goal being cessation?

I resonate more with Tantra / Dzogchen perspectives, which would match with "pellucid" -- seeking a clarity of mind -- though not seeking silence.

2020-10-02 at 14:09:45: (I could totally imagine a company doing that in a bullshit way, but AFAIK they walk the talk - capping CEO pay at 5x lowest-paid fully-vested position, donating to psychedelic research, bringing a mind-boggling peppermint foam shower dance party camp to Burning Man...)

2020-10-01 at 23:08:53: @made_in_cosmos Bc if you're literally seeing things that you know aren't there, and you're feeling confused, you might want to get your blood sugar levels checked (or look into other physical / mental causes).

2020-09-27 at 23:53:49: @maltybegray @alt_visa ‚ù§Ô∏è Totally. There's also the move of allowing your body to "complete the action" that it might be wanting.

Like if your shoulders are tense and hunched, allowing your body to just curl up and hug yourself in a ball, just letting yourself rest in that, &amp; seeing if some ease comes

2020-09-27 at 19:26:06: @maltybegray What if you gave your body permission to run? Give yourself a solid 5 minutes of sprinting, running, jumping up and down, etc, and then see if it's more possible to read the dry material

2020-09-26 at 13:45:05: @visakanv - Laying the groundwork with meditation, grounding exercises, practice feeling emotions in the body, naming, expressing them

- Then MDMA, and integration of that experience 

- Then a classical psychedelic, like psilocybin, + integration 

- Then maybe ayahuasca etc.

2020-09-24 at 22:14:00: @EricMagro2 @JeffLadish How would it still damage a ~120 nm virus if it doesn't penetrate... 

OH! They said cytoplasm, the entire goo of the cell. I was thinking the plasma membrane, which is only like 4-10 nm 

At this scale, human cells are B I G : https://t.co/e7zETT6CLS

2020-09-24 at 22:01:22: @EricMagro2 @JeffLadish Ohhh, huh - thanks for that link!

Okay, so UVC light of 280-254 nm = definitely bad for eyes... 

and then 222 or 207 nm far-UVC can't get through the cytoplasm of human cells so is safe for us...

2020-09-24 at 21:53:38: Ah, right! The resistance to positive states is almost always tied up with a distressing experience, and resistance to *that* --

A deeply emotionally learned story about negative consequences that will inevitably follow the "positive" state

https://t.co/fSAnY6aBEQ

2020-09-24 at 21:49:04: And it's probably unsustainable heavy lifting if they don't allow themselves to receive kindness / be kind to themselves / be in the flow of mutual care. Can lead to burnout, resentment

2020-09-24 at 21:49:03: Ah, and there is the thing where people can end up "performing kindness" because they're worried they'll go to hell if they don't, or because it's what they wished they had as a kid, etc

2020-09-24 at 21:45:05: (For more on "experiential pica" -- like the thing where people crave ice when they actually need iron, but for emotional / meaning nutrients)

https://t.co/hfh3mUxqV9

2020-09-24 at 21:43:14: I guess there is a thing where... people can display kind of "experiential pica" versions of emotional states that they want, but don't quite allow themselves to experience. 

Like someone who's chipper, but it's kind of a top-down effortful facade rather than easeful happiness

2020-09-24 at 21:39:28: I agree w/it, for anger etc -- I forget the source, but I read a great description of anger with &amp; w/o resistance:

w/ resistance: red face, clenched fists, clenched jaw

w/o: a fierce clarity, throat open, voice louder &amp; deeper, blood flowing to the large muscles, ready to move

2020-09-24 at 21:29:36: 1st reaction: üòØ big, if true!

2nd rxn: ü§î Wait, but... people can also have blocks / resistance towards feeling "positive" emotional states. 
If someone resists kindness, or happiness, I don't think that results in them being always kind, or happy? https://t.co/1L26nEhZxD

On the "go to dentist" side... I don't know whether the risk will get any lower over the next few months. 
And emotionally, putting it off feels like not changing the oil in my car or something üòü

2020-09-17 at 16:42:09: Other factors... 

- I currently live with some people are high risk

- I'm nearly certain I already had COVID-19 in March, but wasn't able to get tested at the time. My recent antibody test was "equivocal/inconclusive"

2020-09-17 at 16:42:08: Hmm, I guess I'm not really that worried about catching anything from the dentist or hygienist, as they're thoroughly masked. 

It's my saliva etc that's getting flung out into the room, so I guess I'm most concerned about what might linger from other patients.

2020-09-17 at 16:42:08: If I kept all other settings the same, and switched ventilation to "Outdoor", then the estimated risk would go down to 30 microcovids, "Moderate"

2020-09-17 at 16:42:08: I'm not sure how to describe:

- Ventilation: They've added a LOT of extra ventilation, filtration, and cleaning protocols

For example, there's a big intake hose right near the patient's face, which goes to a surgical filtration unit, and they filter room air between patients https://t.co/lGKXRV40dI

2020-09-17 at 16:42:08: Here are the selections that I think are fairly accurate:

- 2 people near me who are front-line workers (hygienist and dentist)
- Distance is... intimate? Certainly not 3 ft apart
- They're wearing masks &amp; face shields

2020-09-17 at 16:42:07: I'm using the @microcovid tool (https://t.co/hIbn166ash ) to help decide whether to get a dental cleaning, and I'm not quite sure how to put this in as a custom scenario...

https://t.co/MjChmB4LNH https://t.co/5knpxUaODE

2020-08-22 at 04:10:24: @__justplaying @QiaochuYuan Seems more common for people to assume a spectrum of intensity for avoidant and anxious styles or tendencies, like someone could be "a little bit" anxious.

Probably harder to be "slightly" disorganized, bc the pattern tends to spiral / doesn't have stable attractors?

2020-08-22 at 04:04:29: @__justplaying @QiaochuYuan Hmm... I want more resources that offer people a way to notice, "Hmm, I may be experiencing both avoidance and anxiety in my relationship patterns" (disorganized attachment) --

2020-08-20 at 18:29:43: @forgingtowards @selentelechia If you'll never see the other players again, or if they also think like you, then maximizing total payoff is a clear choice.

Meaning is fucking broken, and has been breaking for generations

2020-07-08 at 21:40:58: @bubbleteaPhD @visakanv Like there might be some other layers / assumptions about how the world works, maybe even... 
"People always feel happy after pleasant experiences, and people always feel unhappy after unpleasant/painful experiences" ?

2020-07-08 at 21:37:38: @bubbleteaPhD @visakanv Or whatever framing feels more true. 

Then, laaaater -- after seeing the "gears" of how that belief works -- there's another step that involves looking for (or creating conditions for) an experience that is incompatible with some assumption that holds the previous model in place

2020-07-08 at 21:34:47: @bubbleteaPhD @visakanv Maybe like:

"It's so important that I continue to feel unhappy about my life, because that's how I know that all the bad things really happened to me, and that my reactions were appropriate. It sucks to be unhappy, but without that evidence, I couldn't trust my memory."

2020-07-08 at 21:30:08: @bubbleteaPhD @visakanv ...and more about, first really getting clear on the ways in which the belief makes sense from a particular world model, and feels deeply emotionally true. 

Bringing that into conscious awareness first:

2020-07-08 at 21:27:11: @bubbleteaPhD @visakanv Oh wait a minute... "evidence that this belief doesn't really make sense"? 

The therapist you're working with, are they on board with this whole Coherence Therapy / emotional reconsolidation framework? 

bc from that framework, it'd be less "this belief doesn't make sense"...

2020-07-08 at 18:08:57: @magghu @DrSicchia Those symptoms cleared up and haven't been back... and I'm aware that there could be long-term health risks if I did in fact have viral brain inflammation.

2020-06-19 at 02:15:15: @liminal_warmth @jack_meditates Okay, here's a whole case study, about working with attachment stuff in a way that creates a juxtaposition between an implicit emotionally learned model of how relationships work, and "disconfirming evidence" drawn from the client's life experience:

https://t.co/ctvHYIKjJw

2020-06-19 at 01:47:05: @liminal_warmth @jack_meditates They hold that the Coherence Therapy approach opens up a lot more avenues for working with attachment patterns. Transformative shifts can build on "disconfirming" experiences the client has already had. 

There's an example dialogue in the book, lemme get that over into Roam...

2020-06-19 at 01:43:26: @liminal_warmth @jack_meditates One thing is that the authors are speaking to an audience of therapists who are familiar with "dyadic reparative attachment" (attunement with therapist shows client that functional connection is possible). 

They say that's sometimes a good fit, in context, and not always.

2020-06-19 at 01:18:42: @liminal_warmth @jack_meditates Hmm, that wasn't my read on the Unlocking the Emotional Brain chapter in general... seems my notes aren't capturing the full picture.

2020-06-18 at 23:02:11: @jack_meditates So, I don't have a definitive answer for how to resolve attachment stuff -- I'm still very much working with this, myself.

2020-06-18 at 22:37:13: @jack_meditates I could imagine there being something around control, choice, power, safety...? 

Like, if people want to talk with you, can be reassuring:
"I don't have to feel alone."

&amp; if you can also take space from that, can demonstrate to yourself:
"I don't have to feel trapped / stuck."

2020-06-18 at 22:36:35: @jack_meditates Hmm... if I try to map that to my experience, a phrase that resonates for me is "come here and go away."

I found that phrase while looking into the attachment style called disorganized / fearful-avoidant / unresolved.

At first, I did not know you had a self-commitment to answer truthfully when someone called you on it ("Really?").

I did not like this game before I knew the structure.

2020-05-13 at 18:45:30: @DrAnnaPease @BugQuestions This family of beetles is also called "jewel beetles" - people like @SciBugs even use (non-rare) types to make jewelry!

The shiny / iridescent color of the wing cases comes from tiny tiny patterns in the material, more like a rainbow CD than a pigment color like paint.

2020-05-13 at 18:42:32: @DrAnnaPease @BugQuestions The caption also says that this species eats a limited diet of dead wood, including chestnut and oak trees.

(In the Latin name, "quercus" refers to oak)

2020-05-13 at 18:36:28: @DrAnnaPease @BugQuestions So cool! This might be of interest to entomologists... it seems to be a fairly rare find.

I don't know many details, but basically the clinics using IV infusion / nasal spray are trying to minimize altered states of consciousness, while MAPS-style therapists would work *with* those states.

2020-05-08 at 19:05:14: @KyleBowe4 @fortelabs Therapist might say, ah, they're really clamping down hard on some aspect of their being, maybe unconsciously repressing / resisting the experience.

No visions, no altered mental state, no emotional effects, no sense of "meaning". Sometimes with physical sensations, vomiting / diarrhea, sometimes not.

2020-05-08 at 18:54:28: @KyleBowe4 @fortelabs Glad to!

Yes, in the paper, at the end, they say -- even though the symptoms are similar, it's not technically "anaphylactic shock" because that's when the immune system overreacts to something that you're allergic to.

Instead, this is what the kambo causes directly

2020-05-08 at 18:50:31: @KyleBowe4 @fortelabs Ketamine is also used as an IV infusion or nasal spray for rapid-onset treatment of depression. When used solely for biochemical effects, depression seems to come back in a couple weeks. 

The clinic I linked above takes a different approach, emphasizing the journey &amp; integration

2020-05-08 at 18:48:56: @KyleBowe4 @fortelabs More on integration or only physical / biochemical effects... 

Ketamine is used in emergency medicine &amp; surgical contexts as an anaesthetic, in sufficient doses, and it works for that purpose regardless of mental preparation or integration.

2020-05-08 at 18:41:35: @KyleBowe4 @fortelabs For example, I'm not at all intending to do kambo.

After looking over this paper, I guess I do need to stop calling the effects "anaphylactic shock" -- they're technically different. 

People report vomiting bile, though... that's a nope from me

https://t.co/H6RPht1I1o https://t.co/QdrRpHbphK

2020-05-08 at 18:34:11: @KyleBowe4 @fortelabs Yes, I hold integration to be an important component of transformational work. 

In the tweet above, I picked out a few items from the list that were most likely to result in un-ignorable effects. Didn't yet comment on "desirable / undesirable" or "temporary / lasting" etc...

2020-05-08 at 01:04:13: @BasicMorality Might help clarify the poll - are you asking whether someone has ever experienced these visual anomalies in their life, or only if they've occurred in daily life without a known cause?

(Known causes like psychedelics, migraines, seizures, delirium tremens, etc...)

2020-05-07 at 23:11:21: @fortelabs Re: ketamine, I've heard good reports from friends about this legal ketamine-assisted therapy in Seattle:

https://t.co/9vf0t694fc

Very different approach from the ketamine infusion clinics; more like the MAPS approach to psychedelic therapy

2020-05-07 at 23:05:11: @fortelabs I don't know enough to classify these, and you could surely try them:
- Chaos magic
- Bio-resonance sound healing

I personally don't know how you'd go about trying these:
- Telekinesis
- Mind-reading
- Animate objects
- Auras
- Astral projection

2020-05-07 at 23:04:48: @fortelabs These are like, skills / practices that may require substantial input of time:
- Jhanas
- Lucid dreaming

2020-05-07 at 23:04:21: @fortelabs Things that you can solidly "try" and something is likely, and the magnitude of outcome will vary depending on how you work with it:
- Holotropic breathwork
- Vision quest
- Hypnosis

Harder to tell whether the "try" caused a substantial outcome:
- Microdosing

2020-05-07 at 23:03:31: @fortelabs Things that you can solidly "try" and something substantial is very likely to happen, regardless of what you do: 

- Ayahuasca
- Kambo medicine (yikes, though!!!)
- Ketamine
- DMT

2020-05-07 at 22:53:16: @fortelabs Oh man, I kind of want to see these in a table with, like... what is required to solidly "try" this experience? 
(Accessibility + preparation + experience + integration)

And then - if you "try", how likely is it that something substantial will happen? How much variance? Etc

2020-05-07 at 22:45:18: @coyotespike You know, the other day someone on twitter was like, "what if the moon was made of silver"? Same energy!

(Does WolframAlpha talk to calorie calculating sites...?)

2020-05-07 at 22:43:52: @coyotespike After you said how large the donut was, I'm convinced! 
No ordinary donut 

(also not as big as this gif) https://t.co/M1yqK4Fg1V

2020-05-07 at 22:41:46: @coyotespike whoa! okay then, i revise my donut estimates; the internet references were woefully unprepared for donuts that massive

2020-05-07 at 22:40:27: @coyotespike (Still might be a totally great idea not to eat it! 
Just, like -- it is probably not the same amount of food energy as like 1.3 cups of peanut butter, which is a heckuva lot of peanut butter)

2020-05-07 at 22:37:49: @coyotespike As an estimate, say... 
donut: 250
3 (?) strips bacon: 150
PB icing... one site said 2 tbsp is 200 cal 
banana: 100
honey: 64 / tbsp

= 765 cal

So you might get to 1000, but 2000? üßêüç©

2020-05-07 at 22:36:01: @coyotespike like, one donut with a bunch of stuff on it? 

I'm kinda giving that math the side-eye... 

Looked up the menu, and even if it's the one with a donut + bacon + PB icing + grilled banana + honey... I think it'd be really hard to hit 2000 calories.

2020-05-02 at 22:32:04: @utotranslucence @DRMacIver @Meaningness I'd say this intervention went a long way, and it also exacerbated other issues by making intellectual achievement such a focus of identity and value.

2020-05-02 at 14:36:58: Semi-lucid:
- Ok, well now I'm looking through the closet of my grandfather's house... 

and I find a soccer ball, but I sort of know this isn't going to be a sustainable solution for those kids, because that house got sold years ago, so this is definitely imaginary

2020-04-29 at 02:30:48: @OortCloudAtlas Transcribed a couple short quotes in this thread:

https://t.co/fbBYgm5JON

2020-04-29 at 02:29:25: "The teacher can't rely on pat answers. The student can't rely on his or her own conditioning. 

They both have to step out of their world, and meet."

2020-04-29 at 02:29:24: "And the reason is that, in that interaction, the student has to step out of his or her world, and meet the teacher's world. 

And the teacher has to step out of his or her world, and meet the student's world."

2020-04-29 at 02:29:24: And around 40 min, they're talking about the guru model and teacher-student dynamics. 

Ken McLeod quotes Pierre Hadot, French classics scholar, from Philosopy as a Way of Life:

"Real learning only takes place when teacher and student interact..."

2020-04-29 at 02:22:15: "And I think that the point of Buddhist practice is to find a way of living -- a way of being, if you wish -- so that you don't struggle with life. 

And I think that's a better way of looking at it than ending suffering."

2020-04-29 at 02:22:15: "Because it doesn't matter how rich you are, or how beautiful you are, or how intelligent you are, or how poor, or how destitute, or how sick you are. 

Everybody struggles with life. That's the human condition."

2020-04-29 at 02:22:14: "And I've moved to translating dukkha as "struggle". 

So that you can say that compassion is the wish that others not struggle in their life. 

And you can even take it a step further and say that:

Compassion is the wish that others not struggle *with* their life."

2020-04-29 at 02:22:14: Context: 

"Compassion in Buddhism is very simply defined: it is the wish that others not experience dukkha." 

"Dukkha is usually translated as suffering, and I found that this is actually a very unsatisfactory translation for me...."

2020-04-29 at 02:14:19: Enjoyed listening to this podcast, especially what Ken McLeod said around 32 min:

@Malcolm_Ocean was saying somebody should write a Star Wars fanfic with Tantric instead of Sutric Jedis

and I was like... "soooo you're gonna feed Tantra source texts + Star Wars novels to GPT-2?"

2020-04-27 at 03:12:01: @maltybegray Have watched through episode 5 so far, and I cried after that one

2020-04-27 at 02:46:26: @amelapay @QiaochuYuan Google suggested this related phrase... which was much more popular last year

Are we not looking for beans with the boys at 2am this year? 

I guess most stores have reduced their hours, so it's a tough time for late-night legumes https://t.co/uVUg0rpxgi

2020-04-27 at 02:40:29: @amelapay @QiaochuYuan I figured that

2020-04-26 at 17:32:24: @jack_meditates The notes so far are mainly about disorganized / fearful-avoidant attachment, because that's what I was looking into in November to try &amp; understand my own history better. 

(Many books don't have good resources for this pattern - welcoming suggestions)

2020-04-26 at 17:08:18: @jack_meditates This excerpt from After the Honeymoon has a take on dependency as a skill (and as an unavoidable part of being human) that I haven't seen elsewhere.

Far northern bit of the range up here... I saved seeds from farmers market pawpaws -- mainly an experiment to see how many germinate &amp; if I can get them to grow.

2020-04-22 at 23:09:04: @cognazor Oh dang I just planted some pawpaw seeds yesterday!! Did you cold stratify 'em?

I think I'll actually need to redo it, though, before they germinate... If not in ground, need 10" deep pots or sturdy bags, bc they don't transplant well:

2020-04-22 at 00:48:37: @liminal_warmth Even if you do a lot of your transactions online, you still need a billing address of some sort. 

Even if you set up USPS mail forwarding, some (most??) banks won't forward new cards when yours expire, so you do actually need to change address w/bank:

https://t.co/RlsDkUsHYh

2020-04-22 at 00:42:11: @liminal_warmth If that doesn't make sense, then you'll want a virtual mailbox service to do that. 

For like insurance stuff it probably matters to register your Adventure Van somewhere &amp; get a mailing address that is local to that area. 

https://t.co/2rAxbZFp1T

2020-04-22 at 00:40:27: @liminal_warmth If you have reliable / stable family or friends who can be your default address, that's probably the best. 

Only if you trust them to:
- check for important mail like car registration renewals, new bank cards, tax stuff
- forward stuff to you if needed
- deposit checks
etc

2020-04-22 at 00:34:31: @liminal_warmth yooooo there can be some annoying logistical things re: no permanent address, lmk if you go that route &amp; want some slightly boring tips that can make your Adventure Travel easier maybe

 -- yeah, man, navigating different desires for loudly singing musicals or having peaceful quiet can be challenging in close quarters --

-- and then I read "oil" &amp; realized!

2020-04-21 at 03:11:09: @Malcolm_Ocean Hmm... I'd say something more about acceptance of the constraints of the present moment? 

Which is different than lowering standards globally for similar future situations. 

Honors the various needs / wants / care-abouts, and if necessary grieves what can't be cared for

2020-04-21 at 03:08:09: @Malcolm_Ocean All this to say, I will in fact move the laptop AND the extra monitor, so that we can watch @MidnightGospel in bed 

without me feeling distracted / nervous / empathetic sadness for the loudness of the laptop fan

2020-04-20 at 22:32:37: @DougTataryn @OortCloudAtlas If someone is coughing, the virus would be on droplets. 

Most regular activity probably wouldn't "aerosolize" the virus? That's usually caused by something that creates a very very fine mist. 

(I wouldn't use ultrasonic "cool mist" humdifiers or oil diffusers, for that reason)

2020-04-20 at 22:24:21: @DougTataryn @OortCloudAtlas Here's one paper, which sounds like it might be the same one:

https://t.co/3BW2KTUobO

2020-04-20 at 22:24:02: @DougTataryn @OortCloudAtlas As far as I know, that paper was looking at aerosols -- the virus hitching a ride on very very very tiny particles that float. 

Droplets are larger (although still tiny), and fall out of the air much sooner. How much? I don't know, but it's where they get the "6 ft apart" thing.

- get to your old flat
- pack it up
- hire folks to move stuff to your new flat
- then do the "wait 3 days" after workers have been there, and then you're probably set?

2020-04-10 at 19:56:51: @QiaochuYuan What was the most meta-frustrating thing? 

You've written about it being a great learning experience to not be able to get away from your patterns, problems, etc -- so object-level frustration can be very valuable. 

Is there a frustration that didn't make sense to transcend?

2020-04-10 at 19:51:00: @JaredJanes @ShapesOfEmpathy @cognazor Very interested to hear how all of this might tie in with shi-ne!

2020-04-10 at 19:50:40: @JaredJanes @ShapesOfEmpathy @cognazor I've been talking with various folks, exploring the relations among different paths... one thing that seems to stand out is that integrating the experience of emptiness is an endpoint of Sutric practice, and a foundational starting point for Tantra.

2020-04-10 at 19:36:10: @ShapesOfEmpathy @JaredJanes @cognazor You may very likely be confusing "Sutric" approaches to Buddhism, with the Tantra / Dzogchen approaches: 

https://t.co/3nMxx6Mr6u

2020-04-10 at 19:33:32: @ShapesOfEmpathy @JaredJanes @cognazor As far as I know, folks usually go through Tantric practices as part of Dzogchen?

Tantra is not muted. Rather the opposite:

https://t.co/Fc6BCnqaQB

2020-04-10 at 19:30:44: @QiaochuYuan @nibrasibn It could be a sense of, "Thank you for holding it, and I'm ready to feel the edge of it now,"

 -- or, "Thank you for holding it. I'm honoring that, and right now I don't have the capacity to shift it -- this is not yet the time to unpack that."

2020-04-10 at 19:29:58: @QiaochuYuan @nibrasibn Even, perhaps, thanking that part of your body for holding the tension. 

From one way of looking at it, body tension is blocking the flow of some feeling that would threaten the sense of self. It's protecting a space that feels hurt or vulnerable.

2020-04-10 at 18:00:52: @JaredJanes @ShapesOfEmpathy @cognazor "Yes! I hate this! It is revolting!"

"...More?"

"Please!"

https://t.co/2u9WJWIiZN

2020-04-10 at 17:58:34: @JaredJanes @ShapesOfEmpathy @cognazor I've been using the phrase 
"Connoisseur of Pains in the Ass" 

to describe my best working approximation of a Tantra / Dzogchen compatible approach to experiences that start out with: 

"this sucks, it's frustrating, and I don't like it"

AKA "Thanks! I hate it!" - but sincere?

2020-04-10 at 16:19:34: @ShapesOfEmpathy @cognazor @JaredJanes Oh, hold up -- I mean, experiencing something is simple, in that it's what happens anyhow;

"being with" the experience actually does involve a kind of differentiation / meta move -- for example, self-accompaniment, like what Sarah Peyton talks about in Your Resonant Self

2020-04-10 at 16:15:26: @ShapesOfEmpathy @cognazor @JaredJanes Oh, yah -- getting emotions "right" is definitely impossibly complicated. 

Being with the experience is sort of "simple," in that it's what happens anyway,

and you can also dive deep into the dance of complexity/awareness, and come out the other side into flow.

2020-04-09 at 15:01:05: You may already be familiar with Vajrayana - quoted tweet mentions "meaningness" &amp; "nebulosity", so I figure you've read some of @Meaningness ' stuff?

Seems likely to defuse the cytokine storm exactly where needed for COVID-19 ARDS (the very bad lung thing that can lead to immune system overdrive &amp; organ failures).

2020-04-06 at 20:47:04: @The_Lagrangian Some folks seems to be reaching out to the researchers about CYM-5442 &amp; ozanimod in relation to COVID-19? But without much clarity yet.

It inhibited "intracellular adhesion molecule 1" -- perhaps one part of what is making lung air sacs too "sticky" &amp; messing with surfactant?

Also, fun fact - followed you &amp; did not expect shared interest in weird plants &amp; also (??) home fruitfly cultivation. I raised a BUNCH of flightless ones as a teen - accidentally collected too many wood frog eggs

2020-04-02 at 20:19:37: @rszasz @cybergibbons Huh. Honestly the open source 3D printing ventilator projects would probably be into it.

They've collected hundreds of motivated, otherwise bored engineers (dangerous!! like bored wizards!!)

2020-04-02 at 20:12:57: @llihneergekim @Polypompholyx @cybergibbons I recommend

staying well away from the wacky shrubbery

and I guess getting in touch with extended-state DMT research folks?

2020-04-02 at 18:36:18: @Aryeh___ @QiaochuYuan Ummm... I think it was more like, he could visualize things while on psychs, but not in day-to-day. 

And so he could have like declarative / explicit memory about having had visualizations, but wasn't able to access the content?

2020-04-02 at 18:35:01: @Aryeh___ @QiaochuYuan Honestly they're probably stored in ways

that are keyed to specific kinds of qualia states

( @algekalipso )

so good luck with that? 

I figure non-tantric teachers likely won't find 'em either tho...

for better or worse???

2020-04-02 at 18:32:51: @Aryeh___ @QiaochuYuan oh man

so like - 

I knew a guy

who had aphantasia.

and when he took psychedelics, was the only time he had visual memory.

2020-04-02 at 17:45:03: Hmm, I'm not sure if Zak is tracking quite how much identity-building adolescents are doing online right now?

Their capacity for free time &amp; creativity is only being aided by the lack of school at the moment

2020-04-02 at 16:41:06: @The_Lagrangian Huh! Is anybody looking at this compound for treating #COVID19 #ARDS ?

CYM5442 compound activates a specific receptor in cells lining lung blood vessels; damps cytokine storm specifically

https://t.co/m0fTI0YDMn https://t.co/TM0PXu3cQJ

2020-04-02 at 16:33:25: @The_Lagrangian And from there, as far as I know, the cytokine storm is what can tip the very bad lung thing into full-on "multiple organ dysfunction syndrome" which is exactly as bad as it sounds. 

Cascading system dysfunction, organs failing right and left.

2020-04-02 at 16:31:48: @The_Lagrangian There's something odd here re: the timing of the cytokine storm, perhaps?

Not sure at what point it hit, for Spanish Flu?

For COVID-19, seems to hit only AFTER the very bad lung thing has started - ARDS, acute respiratory distress syndrome - which is NOT specific to the virus

2020-03-31 at 08:59:31: @magghu @Aryeh___ I amend this -

It was not exactly like tripping balls.
One can trip more balls in shorter duration than the average balls tripped per moment, that I experienced these past 10+ days.

More like a loopy stimulant mostly.
But definitely tripping balls
In a few notable moments

2020-03-31 at 08:56:16: @magghu @Aryeh___ Full blown viral mania:
Honestly more intense
Than ayahuasca every other night for six weeks
(Shaman bootcamp)

In my experience.

If you do get it, or similar -

You will need in-person support team.

I am available for remote consulting
(as volunteer ad-hoc ambassador)

2020-03-31 at 08:53:53: @magghu @Aryeh___ I recommend:

Probably not the same way I did -

Most people just can't hold their mania.
I nearly could not.

It was like tripping balls 24/7 for 10+ days.
I appreciate my training in Peru
As practice for this - AND -

2020-03-31 at 03:54:58: @Human__Age @cognazor @JaredJanes Have been generally better at holding space for Bio-Emotive than doing it myself - however, my recent (...temporary?) increase in emotional lability over the past week or two might've loosened up some of the blocks that have made it hard to open up.

2020-03-31 at 03:02:37: @mattoflambda so: 

guess what -- 

I probably would have done something different

except:

I couldn't smell my (whewww) keto breath

until I could smell again

which was only very recently?

So there's that! 

Maybe, again - it did an accidental real good thing for my brain?

2020-03-30 at 23:21:22: @jondubin @ahandvanish @mykola IT IS ON NETFLIX
or

Please see excerpt:

https://t.co/10eBEPBYc8

2020-03-30 at 23:18:18: @jondubin @ahandvanish @mykola FOR YOUR SUPPORT TEAM:

I recommend -- if you do not already 
have psychedelic trip-sitting experience --

WHICH I DO, professionally, from Peru, 
(&amp; Burning Man, as a volunteer) --

Please watch:
Star Trek TNG S01 E02
The Naked Now

For perspectives &amp; advice 
on what to expect

2020-03-30 at 23:15:37: @jondubin @ahandvanish @mykola But probably -- 
Likely -- 

The most urgent thing
is to secure your support team. 

You need: 
Water 
Food (likely meal replacement shakes, etc)
On a regular basis
As much as possible.

Probably also:
Vitamins
(I will make a list)

2020-03-30 at 23:14:17: @jondubin @ahandvanish @mykola -- I do know your name is Hannah, 
not Virginia -- it's a reference
to that Santa Claus letter thing -- 

BUT: I hope, at least - 
that this virus is 
a polite guest
at most BrainBnBs?

For some people it's not?
Unfortunately. 
That article lists some potential complications

2020-03-30 at 23:12:55: @jondubin @ahandvanish @mykola A note -- 
for me, symptom severity
has largely been tracking 
with ability to smell

I suspect -- general indicator of viral inflammation
of olfactory nerves passing through cribriform plate -- 

POSSIBLY the route it got into the brain. 

Yes, Virginia,

You have a brain virus-

2020-03-30 at 23:08:24: @jondubin @ahandvanish @mykola SO: rest assured:

2020-03-30 at 23:06:07: @jondubin @ahandvanish @mykola For me: 

The mania started 18 Mar. 
Not sleeping, eating, drinking reliably
High fucking energy
Bouncing off walls

Still writing in slam poetry, as you can see
but:

Largely symptoms have been trending down as of:
2pm 27 Mar 2020

2020-03-30 at 23:03:38: @jondubin @ahandvanish @mykola I will put together a document
with advice. 

Query: Can you smell things? 
Please check - essential oil, perfume, whatever. 

Top priorities:
Cancel &amp; delegate your commitments
Gather a trusted support crew
Buckle up

This may be: 
extremely bonkers

For me: it was mostly fun

2020-03-30 at 23:01:34: @jondubin @ahandvanish @mykola Send this to any official people

How can I help?

2020-03-30 at 21:04:49: @HiNaryan A mining collective, or groups of farmers or loggers, would not be working with the same non-scarce landscapes, so splitting in those groups is a different kind of thing.

2020-03-30 at 21:02:41: @HiNaryan (That word "anti-rivalrous" I think, used a lot by Daniel Schmachtenberger etc re: mathematical theorems, for example. Can't use 'em up, and the more you have, the easier to make more / better)

Open-source software is another example

2020-03-30 at 21:02:03: @HiNaryan ^ From what I understand - the ideas in Homesteading the Noosphere work best with non-scarce / non-rivalrous / anti-rivalrous goods...

Anorexia (never before!!!)
Mania (never, never like this intensity whatsoever)
Anosmia (improving!)

And a few that came &amp; went:
Weird "dry" nose pain
Clear thin snot drips

Also:
The poetry thing

2020-03-30 at 12:46:57: @Neats29 @oluies @PulmCrit I have had approximately zero particular, or extremely minimal if at all:

Fever
Headache
Nausea / vomiting 
Coughing
Sensitivity to light

2020-03-30 at 12:43:45: @Neats29 @oluies @PulmCrit Please note:
I am into the poetry

And (shh)
Just a bit
Of the mania.

And:
I would not be surprised

See my comments
On your fibrinogen clotting etc post
In combination with:

STROKE

2020-03-30 at 12:33:54: @Neats29 Had been cautious.
Had already pre-emptively
Self-isolated house,
About 17 Mar.

With substantial reduction
In our social interactions
Beginning about
The beginning of March. 

Got it anyway.

wtf

2020-03-30 at 12:32:29: @Neats29 No idea how I got it, folks.

Waterloo had about... 8 confirmed cases at the time
In municipality of 500K
With Ontario at pretty respectable
Proactive testing response
Ratio of 1 confirmed per 100 tests
At the time.

2020-03-30 at 12:27:34: @Neats29 22 Mar - tested self with lavender essential oil

Could hardly smell it at all.

Went "Oh fuck I think I have COVID-19"
Self-isolated in room
Informed housemates.

There followed a scramble
To reorganize house.
I peed in jars for about 1.5 days, 
Then got a designated bathroom.

2020-03-30 at 12:24:02: @Neats29 Well! I noticed the sudden onset anosmia first
Sudden lack of sense of smell

And that only because
I happened to be plugged into
The news-gathering capability
Of 3500+ person Slack group
At the time.

18 Mar - onset of mania
20 / 21 Mar - loss of smell

2020-03-30 at 07:59:23: @Neats29 Well dang

Re-read the article:
I stand corrected.

I have not
As far as I know
Had a stroke.

Just the mania, etc.

But, yes - it does seem
That others have had strokes.

2020-03-30 at 07:56:35: @Neats29 heyoo

dunno about strokes

did someone mention strokes?

Lots of other neurological issues
Are much more likely with this
Than strokes.

Just mentioned Jill Bolte Taylor
As an example of someone
who had an intense brain thing happen
And knew what was happening
during
in detail

2020-03-30 at 07:12:33: @Plinz Fun fact!

2020-03-30 at 06:49:15: @QiaochuYuan Yes - and -

do they sell tempura seaweed, though?

I think the health food store had some...

But:

It was the spicy kind.

And also that was just before the world got real weird? 

So they might be out of stock
And / or -

It just might not be the same
As before

2020-03-30 at 03:15:05: welp...? 

result: LIKELY

although: 
DHL at least, among the many global shipping companies, has declared "force majeure" 
and may default on contracts

due to circumstances beyond their control 

so the outcome remains,
like our times:

I could go for bits of fried right now
But please hold

2020-03-30 at 03:03:19: @mattoflambda BUT:

as a self-diagnostic for anosmia:
regrettably
less easily reproducible

2020-03-30 at 03:02:34: @mattoflambda This is truly

For anosmia self-diagnostic.

It sounds much more delicious

2020-03-30 at 00:22:56: @alt_kia Some COVID-19 has neuro / emotional /behavioral effects

2020-03-30 at 00:21:08: @alt_kia A bit of an odd post from a friendly stranger - if you have noticed yourself forgetting to eat, sleep, drink regularly - if any unusual loss of sense of smell:

Please see my recent tweets
(top of the thread
that the pinned post is part of)

2020-03-30 at 00:14:16: @mattoflambda Well - not SURE

no guarantees
this continues to be
a bonkers situation
at multiple scales

2020-03-30 at 00:13:21: @mattoflambda 10-4

(btw please check your sense of smell to be sure)

2020-03-30 at 00:07:57: @mattoflambda o dear

not you too, good buddy?

2020-03-30 at 00:06:41: @Homebythelake @DFisman @jkwan_md And please - deeply wish they would add anosmia to the testing criteria! Would ID more recovered ppl too

Have called Waterloo Region Public Health twice, and was dismissed bc no recent travel, cough, fever.

See my recent &amp; pinned tweets for context on what has been going on

2020-03-30 at 00:02:12: @thegoodtimeline @algekalipso DM me for an audio recording of myself describing it, may take me a bit of time to reply &amp; also very interested to hear your take

2020-03-30 at 00:01:29: @thegoodtimeline @algekalipso Related: see my latest tweets &amp; why I have not yet felt confident to seek medical attention.

Andres - hell of a virus going around, in your wheelhouse re: anosmia

Would also love to chat re: Bressloff &amp; Cowan research &amp; an experience I had when the viral mania was ramping up

2020-03-29 at 21:57:47: @KinSpin @QiaochuYuan Will look into the others you mentioned, along w/ some other supplement recommendations I've received.

2020-03-29 at 21:57:24: @KinSpin @QiaochuYuan Thanks!

Have been taking zinc, at least 1 per day dissolving tablet held in the mouth, taken with quercetin. 

In addition to some other supplements - 
Vit C, 
Vit D3, Vit K2, tumeric (trying to time these w/fatty foods).

2020-03-29 at 21:53:30: RT @SarahAMcManus: Update:

Talked with my dad, a family medicine doc.

He reminded me, 

'Sarah... you know we, can't really do anything m‚Ä¶

2020-03-29 at 21:52:55: Researchers: 

I would absolutely love to donate blood / plasma / etc
for medical research and treatment. 

And / or to be written up as
a very verbose
case study about COVID-19 viral mania. 

Please get in touch, and let me know how.

2020-03-29 at 21:52:54: Dad: And you can also ask researchers, if they want your immune cells / plasma etc, for science. 

That would involve testing some blood, to see if you have antibodies, so you would also know if you've been exposed.

2020-03-29 at 21:52:54: He advised:

Just keep eating enough food so your thyroid hormones can keep your body warm, keep drinking enough water, try to get outside in the sun.

You can smell like 30% now. You're probably actually recovering, it's probably going down.

2020-03-29 at 21:52:54: Update:

Talked with my dad, a family medicine doc.

He reminded me, 

'Sarah... you know we, can't really do anything much for viral brain inflammation, right? 

If you can eat, and sleep, and talk, if you're not a danger - you don't really need to be in the hospital.'

2020-03-29 at 19:22:33: @magghu @DFisman @dockaurG @picardonhealth Thanks for reposting, Maggie! 

Dr. Fisman, I have been following your Influenza-Like Illness maps with interest and appreciation. 

(In fact, I tried to get the data viz folks on the EndCoronavirus . org Slack interested to do the same for the US)

2020-03-29 at 17:41:01: @mykola @xkcdComic Rare, Unhealthy - turns out, yes!

Very accurate graph üíØ

2020-03-29 at 17:40:13: @mykola @xkcdComic &amp;

ok, this does sound too on the nose, but:

it did make deep sense to me at the time

to include a section on CC licenses

in the emergent group design handbook 

I have been part of writing

while very likely under the influence

of coronavirus mania

https://t.co/ps36Aq6ohI

2020-03-29 at 17:37:16: @mykola @xkcdComic Since some of the very earliest symptoms I experienced

- starting around 18 Mar actually - 

were: 
- working a **LOT** on an online coronavirus group
- noticing I was not reliably eating, drinking, sleeping 

followed by:
- weird dry nose / throat pain
- loss of sense of smell

2020-03-29 at 17:35:18: @mykola And @xkcdComic - if this comic was based on any true anecdotes from your friends:

Please advise them to check the article linked above 
and see if their symptoms match

(Life imitates art or vice versa?)

https://t.co/yBSRCQTXIS https://t.co/PJE3aIRo7k

2020-03-29 at 17:18:57: From the paper above, on influenza mania:

I do not yet know what:
"postencephalitic parkinsonism"
means, exactly - 

but I have a very good guess
that I do not want that thing
to happen to me.

My guess:
the real bad degenerative shakes 
after your brain done swelled up

2020-03-29 at 17:18:57: Here is a paper on how
influenza-induced mania
used to be more of a thing 
earlier in the 1900s:

https://t.co/UcWKz46aI3

(different virus, but you get the drift)

2020-03-29 at 17:15:27: @mykola See more on influenza-induced mania - it used to be a common feature of flu season, earlier in the 1900s?

(Of course, different viruses)

https://t.co/UcWKz46aI3

2020-03-29 at 17:14:17: @mykola I think we are extremely likely to see an uptick of psychiatric admission for sudden-onset mania, in the past weeks &amp; upcoming weeks, if this is indeed what is happening. 

And if so, most of them - all of them? - will not know what is going on.

2020-03-29 at 17:00:35: @mykola Yes! I know one more person in Florida with very similar symptoms (+nausea)

And one in California with similar symptoms but so far the hypomania part is rather - milder

2020-03-29 at 16:43:48: I'm really, deeply, trying to get seen by doctors. 
And wanting to make sure it is the kind
that I think will be most likely to help.

Psychiatrists very welcome, among the doctors, 
as long as accompanied by the other specialties.

2020-03-29 at 16:43:48: Because people have asked:

I'm quite open to a psych workup - as long as, as I said:
it includes viral, neuro &amp; endocrine workup, and does not prevent me from getting those.

2020-03-29 at 16:19:45: @QiaochuYuan AND
their next-door neighbor:

is the brain stem.

Friends, I am concerned.

This has been swell
and I sincerely hope:

that the swelling goes down soon. 

It has already started to, a bit, I hope:
I can smell ~10%, up from 0
&amp; I started feeling slightly less manic
~2pm yesterday https://t.co/MDP4MDuB0w

2020-03-29 at 16:16:42: @QiaochuYuan Those little fucks crawled up my olfactory nerves

- I FUCKING called it at the time, 
let me reiterate - 

Causing a weird nerve pain &amp; anosmia

Made their way to olfactory bulb I figure
Bc hypothalamus is right next door

2020-03-29 at 16:15:37: @QiaochuYuan My meme game: üî•üî•üî•

- HPA axis, etc -

ALSO likely: üî•üî•üî•

2020-03-29 at 16:14:15: @QiaochuYuan I have been
only able to write 
like 
William Carlos Williams

approximately since these symptoms started

~18 Mar 2020

2020-03-29 at 16:06:46: ...and other disorders potentially caused
by one's own immune system 
fighting one's own virus-zombified

** brain cells **

and peripheral nerve cells

etc.

2020-03-29 at 16:06:46: I am mostly:
having a great time!

(see: hypomania)

I am also:
seriously concerned 
the about potential for
short- and long-term sequelae

such as encephalitis, stroke, seizures, dementia...

2020-03-29 at 16:03:54: Now please
someone
with credentials:

Help me tell 
the Waterloo Region Public Health Dept
(Ontario, CA)
what the heck is going on. 

They have not been
returning my calls
(understandably)

I would like:
viral, neurological, and endocrine
evaluation.

I have a brain virus.
Please

2020-03-29 at 16:01:52: I would like credit for:

~ having CALLED IT ~

very accurately
while also experiencing it. 

A thing very few people have done.

Notable exceptions:
Jill Bolte Taylor (stroke)

and 
(sigh, it has been pointed out to me):

2020-03-29 at 15:59:32: In the  
very * DETAILED * notes

that I have been taking
on these symptoms

(re: detail - see: hypomania)

https://t.co/atFRXVqCT2

2020-03-29 at 15:59:32: Count me in for:

- Hypomanic
- Behavioral
- Temporal disorientation, a bit
- Brief geometric visual hallucinations one night

In addition:
- Anosmia (X smell good)
- Insomnia (X sleep good)
- Anorexia (X eat good)

And a few others that are described...

2020-03-29 at 15:55:25: ...cases of organic hallucinosis (visual and auditory hallucinations), behavioral disturbances, delusions of persecution, temporal-spatial disorientation, hypomanic disorder have been reported."

2020-03-29 at 15:55:24: "Psychiatric and neurological complications had been reported during the SARS epidemic in 2003," the neurologists wrote to their society members in Italy. "Apart from mood alterations in the depressive sense, anxiety disorder and suicidal ideas...

I'm not quite *there* - and,
I would invite them to add: "mania" (ish?)

2020-03-29 at 15:51:00: @collinofzion If you try &amp; coregulate your nervous system with mine

at this particular time:

sir, I invite you: 
buckle up -
secure your tray tables -
make sure your seat is in an upright and locked position - 

bc this very likely viral mania

~~ is extremely lit ~~

You were probably saving
For later

2020-03-28 at 03:45:09: @s_r_constantin You probably want @PulmCrit on the case!

Great articles + Internet Book of Critical Care for COVID-19.

Has a different take than some - CPAP as potentially especially useful (keeps alveoli inflated a bit) &amp; aerosol risk as less than for the process of intubation?

Then I asked: Well, what if a doctor blogs about their own symptoms?

2020-03-12 at 00:11:43: @auderdy For Buddhists, see for example the book Zig Zag Zen.

For (syncretic) Catholics, see research on the Santo Daime ayahuasca church groups. Often rather stable / prosocial.

2020-03-12 at 00:07:26: @auderdy I'd say it's worth defining your concerns more specifically, and seeing whether they hold up in populations with different cultural / epistemological backgrounds.

For example, what about extensive psychedelic use plus... Math nerds? Catholics? Buddhists?

2020-03-12 at 00:03:36: @auderdy For example, think about a Venn diagram of "people who believe in crystals and aliens" and "heavy psychedelic users". There's some overlap, but also many people who aren't in both categories.

2020-03-11 at 23:58:54: @auderdy The specific interpretations of those experiences ("Starseeds", "demiurges" etc) will be heavily influenced by each person's surrounding culture &amp; epistemology.

2020-03-11 at 23:58:05: @auderdy Psychedelic users may have some similar classes of subjective experiences, and may also experience system shifts like "cranking pattern-matching up to eleven".

2020-03-11 at 23:57:43: @auderdy I think you're likely working with multiple confounding factors.

If you're mainly interested in shifts in semantic style, then it's important to distinguish that from the content.

2020-03-11 at 22:27:49: @imhinesmi @magghu @cognazor In that case, the toolsets of memetic mediation might come in handy, as well as practices for working with emotional activation individually. 

You might even be able to create enough same-sidedness &amp; spaciousness to reveal what was activating your allergies, &amp; work through that

2020-03-11 at 22:26:02: @imhinesmi @magghu @cognazor And sometimes, you might decide -- "Hmm... I do actually care about this relationship, this conversation, and it makes sense for me to be with my allergy / aversion, rather than acting from it. It's information, and I don't have to be subject to it."

2020-03-11 at 22:24:38: @imhinesmi @magghu @cognazor How well-resourced are you, in that moment? (In terms of time, emotional resilience, attention, etc.)

Sometimes you care deeply about something, but you don't have the resources to care for it. 

Sometimes, you decide it's not actually worth the bet, to engage further.

2020-03-11 at 22:23:27: @imhinesmi @magghu @cognazor If you're considering whether or not to continue interacting with someone, and you feel your epistemic allergies activating -- what's the context of this scene?

Do you have an ongoing relationship with them? Do y'all value that? Do you have a sense of shared purpose?

2020-03-11 at 22:21:41: @imhinesmi @magghu @cognazor The lens I would offer here, is to bring in -- what is the purpose of each specific conversation / interaction? 

Trying to solve this question of "what one ought to do" in a general / "objective" / "universal" case will be more difficult than the specific - or even intractable.

2020-03-10 at 02:36:49: @_awbery_ Biologists call us "deuterostomes" to be polite ("mouth second") but truly, we are ass-first beings

(What would that be, "protoprocts"?)

2020-03-10 at 02:33:23: @_awbery_ More family tree facts! 

A defining features humans share with sea potatoes &amp; starfish is that, as we turned from an embryonic ball of cells into a tube, our anus formed first, and then our mouth. 

Other inverts do the opposite - mouth forms first

2020-03-09 at 00:33:56: @MenanderSoter @m_ashcroft Fair enough!

2020-03-09 at 00:03:26: @QiaochuYuan more context: I was fired from the ayahuasca center for being "too rational," which might either increase or decrease your trust in what I say about plants

2020-02-27 at 21:26:21: @Malcolm_Ocean @mattgoldenberg @__rowboat__ Yeah, I think there's both:

- fluidity through learning
(asymptotic approaches - breaking down step-by-step, then reassembling &amp; practicing until smooth)

- and also fluidity through UN-learning
(removing binds / knots / tangles / self-judgments that hinder fluid action)

2020-02-26 at 23:19:46: @magghu @ShapesOfEmpathy @cognazor @GameB_Phil @VincentHorn I think there are at least 3 lenses at play here: 
conceptual, value, experiential

- How does someone conceptually understand self, other, intersubjective, etc.

- Where does someone locate / anchor value and meaning?

- How does one relate to moment-to-moment experience?

2020-02-26 at 23:13:58: @magghu @ShapesOfEmpathy @cognazor @GameB_Phil @VincentHorn "Trans-egoic" isn't part of my "native" language or conceptual toolkit, and I'm not sure where it's from. 
Maybe Integral Theory?

2020-02-25 at 18:19:43: @GeniesLoki (To the extent that there's confusion in the book, I think it's related to Spiral Dynamics "Green" concepts of power. Overall a lot of useful pieces in there, &amp; fascinating that it's written by a lesbian - almost couldn't have been written by anyone else.)

2020-02-24 at 22:59:49: @coyotespike @QiaochuYuan @aphercotropist Mhm... I've gone to a few Somatic Experiencing sessions, and once the practitioner invited me to notice the tension, notice the move my body was starting to make, and complete the motion. Just curl up and let myself sink into that pose, protecting my stomach etc, see what shifts

2020-02-24 at 22:40:27: @QiaochuYuan @aphercotropist Interesting! Backwards kicking motions seemed particularly satisfying, either swinging freely in an arc, or hitting my floor mattress with my heel.

(*looks speculatively at psoas anatomical diagrams...*)

2020-02-24 at 22:26:51: @aphercotropist Has seemed to prevent that emotional activation from getting "stuck" / "clogged", leaving it available for action after I've jumped around a bit to take the edge off. 

I've been more able to speak to what I'm needing, assertively and without the edge of desperation

2020-02-24 at 22:24:40: @aphercotropist Has worked well so far! I'm keeping track of this as a strategy, will continue seeing how it goes

2020-02-24 at 22:23:52: @aphercotropist I've also been trying out the idea of demonstrating to myself that I'm not trapped, in social situations where I might otherwise have gone into a freeze state. 

A few times I've left a convo to go move -- jumping, stomping my floor bed, etc -- keeping in sympathetic activation

2020-02-24 at 22:20:43: @aphercotropist This pendulation exercise from Somatic Experiencing involves bringing awareness back and forth from body areas of tension and activation to body areas of groundedness and calm. 

Can build capacity for emotional regulation, and resilience:

2020-02-24 at 16:19:54: @DRMacIver I did not have even a single fuck left to give. I did not care. My nervous system had been maxed out for weeks. I was like, "whatever" - yanked the wheel, and jerked around them.

Everyone else in the car was screaming

2020-02-24 at 16:19:34: @DRMacIver I was driving on a highway at night, going from Fajardo to San Juan, when very suddenly, appearing out of the darkness---

2020-02-24 at 16:19:02: @DRMacIver It was the most stressed I have ever been. Weeks of feeling trapped in inescapable double-bind anxiety around my PhD research -- a demand for historical data that did not exist, and no space to talk.

2020-02-24 at 15:55:04: I think there's more to look at here, through the lenses of Coherence Therapy and other systems models - Perceptual Control Theory, predictive coding / predictive processing.

2020-02-24 at 15:55:03: Is it possible to test this effectively in mice? Do researchers have a useful mouse model of existential despair? 

There are some learned helplessness protocols, different from the swim test (and potentially distressing to read about).

2020-02-24 at 15:52:18: It seems like what we want, is fluid movement between:

- the social engagement system (ventral vagal)

- sympathetic activation (which is also part of high-energy play, as well as the clarity of decisive action)

- the deep rest of restorative dorsal vagal functioning

2020-02-24 at 15:52:18: If you don't have ways of taking effective actions towards shifting the situation / creating safety, staying in sympathetic nervous system activation doesn't necessarily help. 

In fact, it might look like anxiety?

2020-02-24 at 15:52:18: So... if an antidepressant slightly inhibits the mouse's shutdown response, or slightly keeps it in sympathetic activation (fight-or-flight) longer, that would count as a success. 

But like... for humans, we want and need more than that. Context matters.

2020-02-24 at 15:52:18: And like - that shutdown is in some ways an "accurate" response for the mouse in the trial? 

It can't escape through its actions, and if it stops moving, the lab tech pulls it out of the water.

2020-02-24 at 15:52:17: From this perspective, seems that depression is a dorsal vagal shutdown response, to situations of overwhelm / trapped / hopelessness. 

Acutely, sometimes this is adaptive in wild animals. Prey plays dead, predator looks away, prey runs off. 

Chronically, for humans, it sucks.

2020-02-24 at 15:52:17: Still pretty new to reading about Polyvagal Theory, and here are a few diagrams.

2020-02-17 at 00:41:23: The way out of these tangles, as far as I can tell, is some combination of:

- Distinguishing between observations/actions and models/meanings

- Holding multiple models as lenses

- Grounding in deep meta-okayness

- Engaging in meta-communication about the scene https://t.co/EqMf84QtPY

2020-02-17 at 00:41:22: This is EASILY CONFUSED with the other two modes, where if someone ignores you completely, they probably just didn't notice. 

AND the honor-shame mode BLOCKS meta-communication:

"Hi! Did you see me there?" leads to DOUBLE-SHUN for naive trust, if the "cut" was deliberate.

2020-02-17 at 00:41:22: To be "cut" socially -- it's a term from 19th c. England:
https://t.co/e9KTelgR1G

If someone ignores you completely, or looks at you and then turns away and keeps talking, "So anyway..." -- this is a dire insult. It means, "You are dead to me."

2020-02-17 at 00:41:22: 3. High-context honor-shame culture

Whew... this one might need some explaining!

Think Regency England, Southern US gentry
(&amp; possibly parts of Asia?)
(&amp; maybe aspects of high school girl cliques??)

Biggest difference from other modes:
"THE CUT DIRECT" https://t.co/rchUKIaBJG

2020-02-17 at 00:41:21: 2. Countersignalling = Safety

The more bland and polite someone is, the less comfortable they are with you. 

Angry words *sometimes* mean angry, and *sometimes* mean "WE HAVE THE CLOSEST OF BONDS, I WOULD TAKE A BULLET FOR YOU, IDIOT ASSHOLE!"

https://t.co/J1qPLyPBRN https://t.co/ZjSN48MB6w

2020-02-17 at 00:41:21: Ok, more on each mode:

1. Straightforward

What you see is what you get. 
If they say "Okay," it means that things are okay. 
If they didn't say anything, or said very little, either they didn't notice or are distracted. 
If they're yelling with angry eyebrows, they're angry. https://t.co/WuM2nT3Xxa

2020-02-16 at 23:50:42: This GCI workshop is all about building robust systems for Level 1 self-trust (follow through) -- and that's the basis for **actually doing** other stuff!

Coaches also have experience debugging Level 2 issues around internal conflict, goal-value alignment, etc.

2020-02-16 at 23:50:41: I talk about 3 levels of self-trust:

1) I trust that I'll follow through on what I want

2) I trust "what I want"

3) I have a sense of deep meta-okayness / basal trust

and I would like to give your worrying systems something to chew on that is FASCINATING and non-scary / easily fixed:

https://t.co/ZviAbZHxGc

2020-02-07 at 00:44:00: @maybegray @Malcolm_Ocean It was slightly uncomfortable! And very liberating! Incompleteness! Imperfection! 

Being with the lived experience of the moment instead of striving for the abstract reward of a future state!

Highly recommend noticing small opportunities to practice, like these

2020-02-07 at 00:42:48: @maybegray @Malcolm_Ocean And, the thing we're trying to be highly reliable about, at this meta-monstery, is a thing around mindset, part of which involves de-layering internal conflict whenever possible instead of forcing it. 

So, I put the rest of the silverware back in the dirty bin.

2020-02-07 at 00:41:00: @maybegray @Malcolm_Ocean And I guess there wasn't anyone immediately around who might feel moved to finish it. 

I wanted it to be done! It's satisfying to have it all done!
And I knew that I'd have to make a move of gritting my teeth and "forcing myself" to scrub all the rest of them...

2020-02-07 at 00:39:36: @maybegray @Malcolm_Ocean This is a little tiny example, and:

I was washing the dishes (we don't have an automatic dishwasher) and noticed halfway through the silverware that I was not wanting to do any more.

I was torn. What to do? It's already in the wash bucket...

2020-02-06 at 20:44:45: @maybegray @Malcolm_Ocean Ahh, Malcolm reminded me of the post I was looking for!

"Half-assing it with everything you've got"

https://t.co/4F4cz20BAE

2020-02-06 at 19:27:25: @maybegray @Malcolm_Ocean Ooooh dang, yeah!
What about like... optimizing towards goals/values/ways of being that you define as meaningful/resonant for you, while satisficing on externally defined goals to the extent that they support your path?

2020-02-06 at 18:19:13: @maybegray @Malcolm_Ocean Probably something being cared for there, some part of you trying to protect you from whatever it predicts would happen if you were seen as "not perfect".

2020-02-06 at 18:15:41: @maybegray @Malcolm_Ocean So that's one kind of pragmatic goals/values/trade-offs approach, and probably also worth looking at, "Why is it so not ok if I can't be perfect?" What does it mean, in your lived experience and world models, to be perfect or not? What does it bring up, emotionally?

2020-02-06 at 18:09:28: @maybegray @Malcolm_Ocean Satisficing ("good enough") vs optimizing ("maximal effort") along different dimensions of situations... I have a hazy memory of a rationalist blog post with good images / metaphors, but can't find it.

https://t.co/1OFZ7rtF31

2020-02-06 at 18:06:15: @maybegray @Malcolm_Ocean has a story about this - have you blogged about this, Malcolm? - realizing that he didn't want to go to grad school after engineering undergrad, so he could take a satisficing / good enough approach to grades while also working on building Complice.

2020-02-06 at 18:03:55: @maybegray Mhm... Do you have a clear sense of what you're wanting from / after your current course of study? Like, "What am I doing this for?" 

When I haven't been in touch with what I want and why, it's been extremely difficult to make decisions about trade-offs.

2020-02-01 at 22:03:01: @FioraAeterna @celestialboon Worth looking at models of why this is hard -- emotional schemas like "I'm bad" can be load-bearing.

2020-01-31 at 18:40:12: @celestialboon - Do astronauts become weak &amp; ill on space journeys? 

Yep, I'm with you on that. Lots of different effects:

Also an emerging field of "space biomedicine"

2020-01-31 at 18:38:17: @celestialboon I'm reading this, and I'm trying to feel into - can I do a leaning-in move of curiosity here? 

In a way that's like building on... I enjoy talking with you here, and looking at unusual things, and I want to keep doing that. 

Do you want to look at this together? If so:

2020-01-30 at 23:15:21: (I had a couple more tweets about not being able to type anything, but it turned out that I'd gotten signed out somehow. Didn't notice because the Roam I'm working on is set to public.)

2020-01-30 at 23:04:04: ^ This also connects to a data integrity piece:

Say I import some source material doc like a book excerpt, and link [[word]]. 

Then I change the [[word]] page to [[Big Fancy Word]] -- the source material now says [[Big Fancy Word]], with no notice to me that I've changed it

2020-01-30 at 23:04:04: @RoamResearch @Conaw Some friction points: 

- Page aliases ( linking uppercase / lowercase, variations of long &amp; short phrasing) - I know this is already a known &amp; popular desired feature

2020-01-30 at 23:00:31: Thread of observations &amp; questions about starting to use @RoamResearch (cc @Conaw ):

- So far, it's an amazing structure! I feel very appetized to pour ideas into it
- I don't get "decision paralysis" &amp; frustration - unlike using tools that force organizational choices upfront

2020-01-30 at 19:56:40: @DRMacIver @nosilverv @RobJLow @ssica3003 ""deeply repressed and passive aggressive" thing is something the upper class do for show and the middle class take seriously"

oh nooooo it's the multi-level signalling thing but weirder

(https://t.co/NjtiSHUMhW)

2020-01-30 at 19:45:31: @DRMacIver @nosilverv @RobJLow @ssica3003 I knew (vaguely) about the spatial Venn diagram... where does the class part come in?

Like, Cockney character Eliza Doolittle from "My Fair Lady" wouldn't be doing the passive aggressive (middle? upper?) class thing of damning with faint praise?

2020-01-30 at 19:41:11: @ssica3003 @nosilverv @Malcolm_Ocean It's sort of like this... like they have a relative scale out of 10: https://t.co/8wfTev69VW

2020-01-30 at 19:33:44: @ssica3003 @nosilverv @Malcolm_Ocean Yes! This is one of them, and then there was another with multiple countries...

2020-01-30 at 19:21:23: @nosilverv @ssica3003 @Malcolm_Ocean Americans spoke with a kind of grade inflation -- "fantastic!!" or "excellent!" for anything like 8/10 or above

While the highest praise from Russians might be "Not bad"

2020-01-30 at 19:17:53: @ssica3003 @nosilverv Praising with faint damns!!

2020-01-30 at 19:17:37: @nosilverv @ssica3003 @Malcolm_Ocean when you get back to Twitter, I think you showed me that chart? Do you know where to find it?

2020-01-30 at 19:17:09: @nosilverv @ssica3003 At one point there was an amazing chart of evaluative words &amp; phrases like "bad" "good" "okay" "pretty good" "not bad" "excellent" "fantastic" etc

and which ones people from different countries were most likely to use, and what they meant on a scale relative to each other

2020-01-30 at 19:14:23: @nosilverv @ssica3003 See also "Damning with faint praise":

https://t.co/E43ctjcah7

2020-01-30 at 19:13:54: @nosilverv @ssica3003 Do you know the difference British / American use of the word "quite"? 

In the US, "quite good" = "very good"

AFAIK, in the UK, "quite good" = "slightly good" or "not good at all, I'm speaking sarcastically but trying to sound polite I guess"

2020-01-26 at 18:14:22: Going to pull a side branch back into this main thread -- a lot of ideas here around "what is self-trust?" and different levels of working with that:

https://t.co/AL9dDjpt7S

2020-01-26 at 18:08:15: @visakanv @celestialboon @s_r_constantin https://t.co/Lc3IE9U4ub

2020-01-26 at 18:07:24: @visakanv @celestialboon @s_r_constantin Important note: feelings of deep not-okayness are often the generator functions that are powering people's motivation systems. 

In messing with these, motivation outages are likely &amp; possibly unavoidable. A few threads:

https://t.co/0qZMYyeera

2020-01-26 at 17:59:41: @visakanv @celestialboon @s_r_constantin Working with this 3rd level is, as far as I can tell, the domain of psychedelic therapy, somatic trauma therapies, deep emotional work from the 2nd level stuff, psychosocial integration, and probably a bunch of other stuff related to meaning, identity, spirituality &amp; embodiment

2020-01-26 at 17:51:55: @visakanv @celestialboon Level 3 is a "trust of self in the universe", a sense of "basal security" on which other kinds of trust can be built. 

This is what gets undermined in trauma. Excellent paper citation &amp; thread from @s_r_constantin:

https://t.co/DT3cjo1gkJ

2020-01-26 at 17:46:14: @visakanv @celestialboon Could surface deeply held fears &amp; beliefs like, "I'm a bad person," or "I have to do [this thing I don't consciously endorse] because otherwise [worse thing] would happen"

Getting those parts to talk with each other, to update to the present environment, to grieve &amp; release

2020-01-26 at 17:43:46: @visakanv @celestialboon Level 2 involves deeper emotional work, often around big buried pockets of self-judgments, compartmentalized emotional schemas, etc. 

Might look like parts work, Coherence Therapy, Bio-Emotive, etc.

2020-01-26 at 17:41:17: @visakanv @celestialboon Level 1 is often called executive dysfunction, akrasia, procrastination, distraction, "lack of willpower" etc. 

And sometimes it's "treatable" without going deeper. A new task management system, an app that blocks distracting websites, developing new habits, etc.

2020-01-26 at 17:38:45: @visakanv @celestialboon Because the issue of "I don't trust myself" could include:

1) I don't trust that I'll follow through on what I want

2) I don't trust "what I want"

3) I don't trust [something big -- my relation to the cosmos, that non-naive trust is possible, etc]

2020-01-26 at 17:27:57: @visakanv @celestialboon Some examples of different types of interpersonal trust -- also relevant for self-trust:

https://t.co/bIe76BYV2K

2020-01-26 at 17:27:27: @visakanv @celestialboon Yeah! So, this matches my sense of, how to build self-trust on the level of "I can act in accordance with my intentions. I can follow through. I can become more reliable."

My current working model: there are many dimensions of trust, and many levels of working w/inner conflict.

2020-01-25 at 01:42:26: Fumblewizard blunders can be co-created between teachers and students 

(see: The Sorcerer's Apprentice)

(One lens: there's always some element of co-creation, implying some leverage points of co-response-ability) https://t.co/KLzpEIH5Qw

2020-01-25 at 01:35:35: To the extent that I'm quoting R.D. Laing at people I don't know, I may be engaging in attempted wizardry at this very moment, that could well lead to fumblewizard blunders!

The risk of fumblewizardry may be unavoidable, for anyone trying to navigate a cultural meaning crisis

2020-01-25 at 01:32:51: Oh man, there's at least a 4th mode (&amp; probably more). 

I dub it: "Fumblewizard"

Unskillful attempts at leveling up students, resulting in some combination of chaos / tragedy / slapstick comedy / narrowly skirting the brink of doom / falling in and clawing one's way out / etc

2020-01-25 at 01:18:06: I have more thoughts, &amp; I'll go ahead and tweet all these here so I don't lose the drafts

2020-01-25 at 01:18:06: By showing someone that our default systems have significant crappy elements, and introducing the move of transcending systems as a path to agency / strength / capacity... the blinders &amp; chains are coming off, but so are the guardrails.

oh no https://t.co/a9nQk5K70E

2020-01-25 at 01:18:04: This 3rd mode is:

- "Dark" bc of undermining students' self-trust in ways intended to benefit teacher at their expense, or which lead to other cascading harms

- "Wizard" bc breaking norms -- the "normal" protections of the default (albeit crappy) systems are not in play

2020-01-25 at 01:18:04: So, I summarized this "dark wizard" mode of teaching as: Build capacity, undermine self-trust, transgress norms

Someone in a teaching role can make a student both "stronger" &amp; "weaker" at the same time, in different dimensions/areas

2020-01-25 at 01:18:04: "Dark wizard" mode of teaching

(Term from @meditationstuff 's model: https://t.co/RpxXSc3kCd )

Sooo... this is where Mason's tweet comes in again:

2020-01-25 at 01:18:03: Much, much more on "teacherly authority" in this @dthorson Emerge podcast with Zak Stein - annotated transcript &amp; links in this Google doc:

https://t.co/kXiHW2tFEa

I'll probably return to this later in the thread, after putting out a 3rd mode of teaching...

2020-01-25 at 01:18:03: Generative mode of teaching:

i.e. Zak Stein's "teacherly authority" -- teacher creates a space that is safe for not-knowing (this is unsafe in default mode)

Students build self-trust, build capacity for self-direction, sensemaking, Jordan Hall "sovereignty"

2020-01-25 at 01:18:03: Default mode of teaching: 

Train students to gain bounded capacity that conforms to a given system of norms. Undermine self-trust to get obedience to authority &amp; "right answer" 

Range of outcomes, from beloved teacher who inspires, to hated teacher - but still within a system

2020-01-25 at 01:18:03: 3 modes of teaching: 

- Default: Build bounded capacity, undermine self-trust to get obedience to norms

- Generative: Build self-trust &amp; capacity, transcend &amp; include norms

- "Dark wizard" (Mark Lippmann's term): Build capacity, undermine self-trust, transgress norms

2020-01-25 at 01:18:02: So, we're growing up in *that* shitshow. 

Somebody comes along &amp; says, "I can teach you to have more capacity in some important way!"

I'm gonna talk about (at least) 3 models of teaching &amp; capacity &amp; self-trust

(I'm thinking out loud here - rough draft)

2020-01-25 at 01:18:02: Laing: "We are instructed to be trustùôûùô£ùôú of certain others, who tell us that we cannot trust ourselves. So that we are called on to place our untrustworthy trust in those who tell us to trust them when they tell us that we are untrustworthy: hence, our trust is untrustworthy."

2020-01-25 at 01:18:02: Gonna start off with some R.D. Laing, saying some real shit about double binds in our default cultural context:

https://t.co/Ww2ooIo1SB

2020-01-25 at 00:35:59: *This* is a whole entire thing

It's probably the hardest part about learning / growth / blind spots / developmental challenges (in the Kegan etc sense)

How can you bootstrap self-trust? How can you trust someone to hold that learning space for you if you don't trust yourself? https://t.co/ewEqNKLbij

2020-01-22 at 20:29:36: @celestialboon @FioraAeterna @goblinodds Yah, if we're talking descriptively about how the world currently works -- I agree that people most often compress to good vs bad.

2020-01-22 at 20:27:05: @celestialboon @FioraAeterna @goblinodds I claim that leaving space for not-knowing -- while still making pragmatic discernments -- gives a lot more room to maneuver on a bunch of different scales, from internal parts work to interpersonal interactions to big social dynamics.

2020-01-22 at 20:25:09: @celestialboon @FioraAeterna @goblinodds So like, a snap decision on -- "Working with this person: yes or no?" is useful in many contexts. 

And, there's a way to hold that decision that either isn't coming from a good/bad model of "what is a human being?" or leaves space for not-knowing

2020-01-22 at 20:23:11: @celestialboon @FioraAeterna @goblinodds Feeling into the meta-question of "what question are we asking here?"

I wonder if it might be a difference in wording?

I use "judgment" as a kind of universalizing good/bad (etc), while a "discernment" would be in relation to fitness for some purpose:

https://t.co/HliaB1JsKH

2020-01-22 at 20:12:31: @celestialboon @FioraAeterna @goblinodds I'm imagining kind of a "low-friction to high-friction" spectrum, for the interaction. 

Along with other dimensions like:

- How important is this interaction?
- How many "spoons" do I have (in this moment or in general) to put towards navigating this? What's their capacity?

2020-01-22 at 20:04:18: @visakanv @__rowboat__ @liminal_warmth Unfortunately, unskillful cooperators can still contribute to painful interactions! As I wrote in another branch of the thread:

https://t.co/b2vZzidmso

2020-01-22 at 20:01:35: @visakanv @__rowboat__ @liminal_warmth If someone's intentions are aligned with the intent of the social scene, but something else is getting in the way of their capacity to navigate it fluidly - they may get lumped in with the first group of unskillful defectors. But really, they are an "unskillful cooperator"

2020-01-22 at 20:01:16: @visakanv @__rowboat__ @liminal_warmth If their intention is out of alignment &amp; that's coming from a deeper generator, like profoundly different emotionally-held models of the world, or [something biological about sociopathy / lack of empathy?] - their actions may be smoother, and go unnoticed. "Skillful defector"

2020-01-22 at 20:00:43: @visakanv @__rowboat__ @liminal_warmth If someone's intention is out of alignment with some part of the social scene, and they have to consciously think about deception, their actions are likely to read as clunky, creepy, or "off" in some way. Let's call this "unskillful defector."

2020-01-22 at 20:00:22: @visakanv @__rowboat__ @liminal_warmth There's also something here about Goodhart's law, systematization, and improv. Spitballing:

Like, people often have a different kind of trust in social signals related to right hemisphere / improv / felt sense / quick reactions / microexpressions, bc it's hard to "fake".

2020-01-22 at 19:00:01: Fascinating thread up &amp; down from here, exploring "over-active anti-sociopath defenses" 

&amp; how "being *openly systematic* (wrt social interactions especially but basically anything) can be read as inherently *hostile*" https://t.co/ZhH8MX6oJB

2020-01-22 at 18:57:44: @visakanv @__rowboat__ @liminal_warmth The McGilchrist brain hemisphere model also seems relevant here - lots of material in this post &amp; thread to help understand different perspectives on meaning, improv &amp; social navigation: 

https://t.co/yQDBzMuvar

2020-01-22 at 18:55:17: @visakanv @__rowboat__ @liminal_warmth ---------------------------
Liking this thread here, on the value of information in the gut sense / spidey sense of unease, and what to do with that in navigating interactions:

https://t.co/ArUOaZk2n7

2020-01-22 at 18:40:35: @FioraAeterna @goblinodds Yes! From the bad/good worldview, the solution looks like -- just determine who is bad, punish / exile the bad people, and then the good people can have good times. Simple!

But as you point out, it's messier than that.

2020-01-22 at 18:33:37: @goblinodds You can still get into painful interactions regardless of the other person's underlying intent. 

Sometimes there's space and mutual shared purpose towards sorting out a better navigation system, and sometimes there's not

2020-01-22 at 18:32:05: @goblinodds And like, I wouldn't say disregard spidey senses -- may be valuable info there to sort through. 

Gut might say: "This person might not pick up on my nonverbal cues. I don't know what to assume in this interaction or how to navigate. They might step on my toes [or worse]"

2020-01-22 at 17:49:39: @visakanv @__rowboat__ @liminal_warmth Although -- it's more like those shark nets placed around swimming beaches, rather than regular fishing. 

Some shark nets try to entangle the sharks in mesh &amp; kill them -- higher risk of other species getting stuck. Other barriers try to keep them out.

2020-01-22 at 17:03:09: @availablegreen Architects are trying to achieve a specific, pre-planned outcome, and surprises (deviations from predictions) are bad.

Gardeners (&amp; collaborative / improv composers) can be pleasantly surprised -- delighted, astounded! -- by emergent outcomes better than they could've predicted.

2020-01-22 at 17:01:16: @availablegreen - Re: familiarity &amp; surprises -- Brian Eno's piece on "Composers as Gardeners" rather than architects is a fantastic take on this:

To what extent is that vision shared / compatible / different? How do they relate to current &amp; potential future differences?

Pull out the stick, and knots unravel! At least some of them. Useful metaphor here? https://t.co/RYqyavTxsH

2020-01-21 at 17:20:15: @meditationstuff (above from "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!")

Two metaphor extensions that interest me:

1) Given a 2D puzzle -- would psychedelic therapy potentially be like allowing a 3D move that unsticks something otherwise blocked or tangled?

He described the 4th as "Looking Around" -- more related to "what are the possibilities of consciousness?" / shamanic work / etc

2020-01-21 at 15:56:24: @maybegray @QiaochuYuan @Fooljeff @BampotTea I do want to say, briefly, that the most meaningful parts of the weekend for me happened adjacent to the workshop. 

There were some logistical / design constraints of timing &amp; venue that weren't a good fit for me to go into deep vulnerability and release in that setting.

2020-01-21 at 03:32:14: @meditationstuff And annealing -- if you could shake up a stuck Tetris field, it would likely settle back in a way that would clear some rows &amp; free up more space for deliberate maneuvering

2020-01-21 at 03:31:53: @meditationstuff Do cables share properties in common with objects in Tetris or Candy Crush? 

Except that aligned instances of cables collapse to 1 (as opposed to disappearing entirely)

2020-01-21 at 03:31:22: @meditationstuff Ok, so... annealing is a kind of shaking up and settling back down in lower-energy configuration

And in elegance collapse, "correct reweavings cause cables to losslessly become one"

I am, for better or worse, suddenly thinking of tile-matching puzzle games

2020-01-21 at 03:08:43: @meditationstuff I've taken the "steel cables" as needing to be rewoven one by one, and if so, it would seem in conflict with models that predict &amp; explain self-organizing transformative or catalytic shifts. 

Are they in conflict, or compatible in some way? ("Elegance collapse"?)

2020-01-21 at 03:06:06: @meditationstuff And/or "neural annealing" models, connectome-specific harmonic waves:

https://t.co/EvZG6uZLb8

2020-01-21 at 03:05:09: @meditationstuff I've been wondering about the "steel cables" metaphor... how does that relate to systems theory models? 

For example, predictive coding &amp; perceptual control theory (hierarchical "thermostats" - change a high level &amp; lower levels reorganize)...

2020-01-20 at 22:33:30: @maybegray @Meaningness also has some things to say about chairs, especially try to get your sit bones higher than your knees:

https://t.co/G90lPnCPXe

2020-01-20 at 22:30:48: @maybegray ^ I may try the seiza bench thing. There are also office chairs that offer a similar shape - "kneeling chairs"

"Sit on the front of your chair" with spine stacked may be possible in your lecture hall situation? Or maybe there's some way to bring in a cushion etc?

2020-01-20 at 22:28:15: @maybegray And of course there's the contextual piece about -- can you adapt your environment to offer more opportunities for varied movement, vs. conforming your body to sitting. 

And sometimes you do want to sit, so...

https://t.co/TkuHB2i5QV

2020-01-20 at 22:25:28: @maybegray Right?? I don't really actually know how to sit in a way that feels satisfying &amp; sustainable for long periods of time. 

I end up with standing desk, trying to do a kneeling thing with pillow supports, leaning on pillows on a couch or bed, etc.  

Meditators prob. have tips...

2020-01-16 at 21:45:59: @malki I like Dandy Blend for a caffeine-free rich-tasting dark hot drink. Quick to make &amp; you can adjust the concentration to make it as intense a flavor as you want.

It's not bitter, so it doesn't need sweetener &amp; milk/cream, but it also goes well with them.

2020-01-15 at 22:50:59: @meditationstuff @DRMacIver ^ Seconded! And also, as far as I can tell, it's hard to *do* coherence therapy on yourself. To get the schema activated, you need to be "blended" with the part, and it's difficult to be meta enough to see your blind spots, unintegrated places, etc at the same time.

2020-01-15 at 01:44:36: @Malcolm_Ocean @QiaochuYuan Summary of Unlocking the Emotional Brain, for reference re: this thread:
https://t.co/qTOmblIgpq

2020-01-15 at 01:40:59: @Malcolm_Ocean @QiaochuYuan He describes how this experience, along with other emotional / somatic / meditative practice, has changed his experience of a throat/voice blockage. 

Not only can he relax his throat, he's also able to relate to the tension as an indicator rather than a problem.

2020-01-15 at 01:36:43: @Malcolm_Ocean @QiaochuYuan Becoming aware of a "symptom" - I don't feel any anger. 

Getting into emotional activation &amp; bringing a schema into awareness - If I express anger, I'll die. 

Holding that active schema, simultaneously with a disconfirming experience - I can express anger and be supported.

2020-01-15 at 01:31:57: @Malcolm_Ocean &amp; @QiaochuYuan - I don't know whether Tiago has read Unlocking the Emotional Brain, and he describes an experience that maps so well onto the emotional reconsolidation process: https://t.co/Rxs8nbMvHz

*squares shoulders to face a new software thing that I've been meaning to try out*

2020-01-13 at 20:02:48: @nosilverv @algekalipso @QualiaRI *nods*

What kinds of interaction formats feel good for stuff like this? 

One option is giant twitter threads, that could later get turned into blog posts!

Could be emails back &amp; forth, and I sometimes find myself more daunted / less appetized by big email threads.

What else?

2020-01-13 at 19:55:28: @nosilverv @algekalipso @QualiaRI Also very down to either A) explore this 1-on-1 or B) see whether there's a group that might be interested. 

(Would only want to look into B at this point if it enhances the original purpose of deeply grokking, not if it interferes)

2020-01-13 at 19:47:41: @nosilverv @algekalipso @QualiaRI I'm picturing a kind of tech tree of, what pieces of background understanding go in to reading that Neural Annealing post? 

And then from there, what are paths of putting those ideas into practice? And/or using those ideas to refine practices you already do?

2020-01-13 at 19:43:46: @nosilverv @algekalipso @QualiaRI I'm from the US &amp; in Canada... we could do video calls? Scribbling on virtual whiteboards &amp; watching cool videos about pattern formation?

2020-01-13 at 19:39:06: @nosilverv @algekalipso @QualiaRI And so... yeah! If you wanted to look at this together, I feel energy &amp; appetite towards that, whatever form it might take. 

Figuring out where to start from &amp; building from there, maybe even marking a trail that others could more easily follow.

2020-01-13 at 19:36:57: @nosilverv @algekalipso @QualiaRI Both to understand / grok it better myself, and to make these deeply useful frameworks more widely accessible so more folks can build practices around them. 

I think they're like... the best in-development models of how brain &amp; mind stuff works, and I think it's learnable.

2020-01-13 at 19:34:32: @nosilverv @algekalipso @QualiaRI Ah, reading this, I feel a little, hmm... "dang / saddened / unskillful" in presenting Mike's posts with "ohohohoho MOAR MATH". 

I have a lot of self-judgement loops &amp; school trauma &amp; blocks around math that gets into greek letters. I find this stuff joyful &amp; I want to share it

2020-01-13 at 19:08:25: @celestialboon @danlistensto @meditationstuff Not suggesting anarco-primitivism as a solution -- there's no "blue pill," can't go back. 

More pointing at frameworks like the one Robert Gilman uses, distinguishing Tribal / Empire / Planetary cultural frameworks:

https://t.co/TOJyTkyS21

2020-01-13 at 19:06:33: @celestialboon @danlistensto @meditationstuff And a lot of culture historian folks mark that transition even before colonialism, looking at the shift from hunter-gatherer to sedentary agriculture. 

Storing grain allows accumulation of power, more inequality than previously possible, property to defend and attack, etc.

2020-01-13 at 18:58:51: @danlistensto @meditationstuff Huh, staring at this a bit longer... maybe that Buddhist "best not to start" saying is from a time period in which it was even possible to be in a culture that was a good fit for meaningful humaning in the surrounding environment?

2020-01-13 at 18:55:59: @danlistensto @meditationstuff As in, if your cultural context &amp; meaning-making apparatus is a good fit for your environment, maybe best not to start picking it apart.

If you do start unraveling it and risk getting stuck in nihilism (blackpill), best to finish (whitepill).

2020-01-13 at 18:55:04: @danlistensto This thread &amp; framework reminds me of the Buddhist saying that's something like, ‚ÄúBetter not to start. If you start, better to finish.‚Äù (as phrased by @meditationstuff)

2020-01-12 at 04:36:01: @mrgunn @nickbaum @KevinSimler If I was delegating a process where the details mattered, it's sort of the mindset of documenting code, writing spec, or a standard operating procedure. 

I'd do the process myself while writing down each step, hand it off, and be prepared to field questions &amp; iterate

2020-01-12 at 04:34:47: @mrgunn @nickbaum @KevinSimler If I was delegating a task where just the outcome mattered, I'd specify the parameters I wanted &amp; leave the rest to them. (ex: Find 3 options for [product] with good reviews, under $100, Prime shipping / Get 3 quotes for removing that tree, make sure company has worker insurance)

2020-01-12 at 04:15:32: @mrgunn @nickbaum @KevinSimler Oh dang, no wonder! Sounds like a Sisyphean task management system for sure. 

Working with the same VA over time would at least make it easier to build up familiarity with what you're needing and the best ways to coordinate.

2020-01-12 at 04:10:51: @mrgunn @nickbaum @KevinSimler That's an excellent question! I don't have a simple answer. I bet that general guides exist (and task-specific ones). I suspect that the overall question is a "human-complete problem". 

(In fact, as a coach, I'm about to work with a client on designing delegation systems.)

2020-01-12 at 01:41:18: @sadmoonanalog Y'all want the most grounding miso soup ritual? 

Yes indeed. Here it is (PDF): https://t.co/cwpa2KGvtJ

2020-01-12 at 01:36:22: @sadmoonanalog Yeah, whew. One time, I got real confused in a cosmic solipsistic kind of way, and then I followed Sandor Katz' recipe for miso soup. It's very calming. Found my way back to groundedness via that ritual, and by extension the larger set of rituals that remind me who I am.

2020-01-12 at 01:27:00: @m_ashcroft Ooh @Malcolm_Ocean - check this out! Sounds like a lot of fascinating potential connections to Iain McGilchrist's hemisphere research, sort of a "walking on the right side of the brain" parallel to the book "Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain"

2020-01-12 at 01:11:36: @nickbaum @KevinSimler (I don't recommend that company, Zirtual, because they folded overnight in a spectacular mess!)

I can point folks to my friend Emily Gomez, who has been in the VA field for years:
https://t.co/H8aXTuiPwJ

2020-01-12 at 01:07:28: @nickbaum @KevinSimler The company I worked for had a defined scope for VAs, so some things were out of bounds for liability reasons (taxes/accounting, signing you up for financial / utilities services, etc).

2020-01-12 at 01:06:33: @nickbaum @KevinSimler Others wanted to offload occasional side tasks or last-minute rush jobs, so they could focus on what only they could do. 

Ex: compare and book flights &amp; travel; find a birthday gift for a niece; do research to inform some decision.

2020-01-12 at 01:04:59: @nickbaum @KevinSimler Some clients delegated core parts of their business (ex: managing their email inbox, coordinating all their scheduling, data entry). 

Others wanted help bootstrapping systems that they would then use (ex: I set up Streak in Gmail for CRM, very satisfying color-coding).

2020-01-11 at 02:12:59: @ShapesOfEmpathy I don't have a strong stance on it -- partly why it starts to get shrouded in confusion clouds and dragons and whatnot above level 3. 

If I make any future approaches to visualizing meta moves, I'd want to incorporate Bonnitta Roy's 6 Ways of Going Meta, linked in that thread

2020-01-11 at 01:54:52: @ShapesOfEmpathy Well -- I guess actually several of those:
https://t.co/8OI0fJYCrF

2020-01-10 at 20:09:09: @jeonghopark @cortexelation sounds like something you might be interested in!

2020-01-10 at 02:09:37: @mattgoldenberg @Malcolm_Ocean These paths will likely involve a period of your motivation engine being offline and/or other weird experiences. 

If possible, best to have enough slack/runway/space to bootstrap that process plus a learning context / community of practice.

6/

2020-01-10 at 02:07:44: @mattgoldenberg @Malcolm_Ocean And there are "deep end of the pool" approaches to entirely rebooting your motivation system, switching from internal coercion to intrinsic alignment. 

5/

2020-01-10 at 02:06:08: @mattgoldenberg @Malcolm_Ocean I figure, there are many "shallow end of the pool" ways to work with internal conflict more generatively, with less internal friction. These take a small amount of starting energy, and soon return more spaciousness. (Various kinds of emotional processing, parts work, etc.)

4/

2020-01-10 at 02:05:17: @mattgoldenberg @Malcolm_Ocean (^This also facilitates interpersonal collaboration.)

And so, because I'm in this context, I force myself through internal conflict less than I would otherwise. 

I still do act from conflicted states. 
(Counterproductive? Possibly! Produces learning? Sometimes!)

3/

2020-01-10 at 02:02:19: @mattgoldenberg @Malcolm_Ocean I'm involved w/ a group where the intended practice is not to do things from a space of internal conflict, and to instead notice &amp; reorient to the situation from an internally collaborative meta level whenever possible (ex: see the book Getting to Yes with Yourself). 

2/

2020-01-10 at 02:00:02: @mattgoldenberg @Malcolm_Ocean Oh! I resonate with your paradox, Matt, and the koan that Malcolm posted. Trying to recall the context of that convo, and wanting to clarify a bit:

I don't recommend any sort of blanket moral imperative move of "never act from internal conflict."

2020-01-09 at 18:57:15: @nosilverv Hmm, wanting to clarify my earlier tweet -- not so much working towards "the stable" post-trauma-dependent culture, but more like -- a resilient cultural platform upon which many different cultures could be built. 

Like an open-source OS that can run many different programs.

2020-01-09 at 18:34:38: @nosilverv Some folks of that era were very prescient (eg Vannevar Bush, Marshall McLuhan) and many, many more were tremendously far off the mark.

Really difficult to tell in advance which way my predictions might go!

2020-01-09 at 18:32:09: @mattgoldenberg @nosilverv I can intellectually theorize about what the stable post-trauma-dependent culture would be like, and I've had glimpses of lived experience, and... yeah. 

Feels a bit like being a mid-20th-cent thinker trying to make predictions about the information age.

2020-01-09 at 18:24:57: @mattgoldenberg @nosilverv And what I've got to offer right now is... being in a transition culture is uncomfortable, disorienting, and just really fucking hard. üòüü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

2020-01-09 at 18:23:41: @mattgoldenberg @nosilverv Whew, yeah. I'm definitely thinking about this, and attempting to lay the groundwork for a non-trauma-dependent culture through lived, iterated practice and research.

2020-01-09 at 17:48:52: @s_r_constantin @vgr (Mhm! In my cultural context, I use the word "discernment" to refer to this subset of "true judgments" that are about describing "goodness of fit for a particular purpose" rather than assigning universal or intrinsic good/bad, right/wrong, etc.)

2020-01-04 at 00:07:01: @ChasingMyself Highly recommend "After the Honeymoon," which I'm currently reading w/my partner. 

Author does an excellent job capturing both snark and vulnerability when writing internal dialogue, and takes a really realistic stance on "You're gonna do shit anyway, so take it as an indicator"

2020-01-02 at 00:17:54: @hmmmcurious @Meaningness @DougTataryn @QiaochuYuan ^^ This has all been in response to, "How did you end up integrating your unusual experiences?"

2020-01-02 at 00:07:06: @jondubin @hmmmcurious @Meaningness ^ And also it wasn't... deliberate? It was more of a reflex action. 

I only put that sort of label on it long after the fact, as part of trying to understand what happened.

2020-01-02 at 00:06:16: @jondubin @hmmmcurious @Meaningness Yeah, recommend avoiding panic dump if possible. Was a bit like throwing the baby out with the bathwater -- throwing out meaning, motivation, purpose, self-concepts, transcendent experiences along with the aspects of that particular center &amp; belief system that I found disturbing.

2020-01-02 at 00:00:02: @hmmmcurious @Meaningness @DougTataryn @QiaochuYuan What else... Oh. Yeah, there was one time where I came back from an unusual experience and was surprised that they'd replaced the bathroom faucets at work while I was away.

- Panic dump of all mystical beliefs after I thought I'd been "infected" by madness in Peru
(I don't recommend this one! Felt like an emergency warp core ejection. Led to months of depression due to loss of belief in self and meaning)

2020-01-01 at 23:45:58: @hmmmcurious @Meaningness Ohh, that's a good question. And a lot of different answers - the main one being, "still in progress."

2020-01-01 at 23:31:44: @hmmmcurious @Meaningness Oooh, another factor: What side benefits might you get from the investigation, even if [unusual idea] didn't pan out?

Ex: Hiking up to the mountaintop for a ritual - good exercise, if nothing else!

2020-01-01 at 23:14:31: @hmmmcurious @Meaningness I hope the examples are coming across in the way I'm intending, grounded caring + humor. 

I used to work at an ayahuasca center, until I got fired for being too rational.

I've had some... extremely unusual experiences, and I've made some more and less risky bets myself.

2020-01-01 at 23:03:10: @hmmmcurious @Meaningness If you think of risks, see if there are any ways to investigate [unusual idea] that avoid or mitigate these risks. 

That will be useful for your wellbeing, and can also make it easier to show concerned friends that you're tracking the pragmatic as well as the [unusual]. 

6/

2020-01-01 at 22:59:15: @hmmmcurious @Meaningness Ex. high-risk unusual bet (cont'd):

Cost: High in $$$$ (plane tix, hallucinogens), time (months or years), etc.

Risks: High potential damage to social connections, (cults, reputation/trust), mental health (mania, psychosis), physical health (tropical maladies), etc.

2020-01-01 at 22:55:57: @hmmmcurious @Meaningness Ex. high-risk unusual bet:

CONTRIBUTE to my kickstarter here:"

[cont'd ‚¨áÔ∏è]

Cost: Low (&lt;$1 + 5 min/day)
Risks: Mild (may attract possums, or raised eyebrows and gentle ribbing from friends)

3/

2020-01-01 at 22:32:56: @hmmmcurious @Meaningness - Do you have enough slack to make this bet, and to "lose" the bet comfortably if [unusual idea] turned out to be unfruitful or definitively false?

- Are there ways of investigating [unusual idea] that are less "costly" or "risky" while still giving useful info?

2/

2020-01-01 at 22:32:33: @hmmmcurious @Meaningness One shape of safety net: 

- Think about what it involves for you to pursue your interest in [unusual idea].

- What sort of resources (time, money, effort, social regard, etc) might you invest in this investigation?

2019-12-09 at 21:51:53: @visakanv I did some research in El Yunque, and was surprised to hear that a professor got lost for 12 days (!) there in 1997. Unless you're injured, you could pretty much walk downhill, follow a stream to a river, and you'd find a road within... I mean, it's 10 miles / 16km at the widest.

2019-12-09 at 21:46:42: @visakanv Is is possible to get lost in Singapore? 

(Like "wilderness hiking" lost, as opposed to "dang which highway exit?" lost.)

I see a big green bit in the middle, a few km across. My main comparison is El Yunque Nat'l Forest in Puerto Rico, which is a few times bigger.

2019-12-09 at 21:38:33: @visakanv For example, I didn't know that Singapore was so relatively small, or that Thailand has a looooooong bit, or even that Malaysia was in between there *and* another big separate part.

2019-12-09 at 21:34:38: @visakanv Most of what I know about Singapore is probably from following you!

I just looked a bit at Google Maps &amp; Wikipedia, and realized how much I didn't know about the basic geography of SE Asia and the Pacific islands.

2019-12-09 at 19:52:50: @nullary Wikipedia describes "mariri" as a particular spiritual energy that moves through shamanic phlegm, and I think I also heard it used more broadly. As in, an icaro (song) sung in person has "mariri" but a recorded one doesn't.

https://t.co/kcdAgy6lHF

2019-12-09 at 19:52:22: @nullary And the MƒÅori word "mauri" as "an energy which binds and animates all things in the physical world" is very interesting, because some traditions of ayahuasca shamanism in the Amazon use the similar-sounding word "mariri" to refer to spiritual energy.

2019-12-09 at 19:47:35: @nullary Huh! I guess I'd thought "mana" as in magic/games was derived from Biblical "manna" (mysterious divine food source) -- this makes a lot more sense!

2019-12-08 at 20:10:59: I grew up in the southeast US, and "losing face" just feels like such a gut concept.

I find it hard to imagine how English-speaking honor cultures worked before having that phrase.

2019-12-08 at 20:01:32: Whoa. I had no idea that "losing face" / "saving face" are fairly recent semantic loans to the English language from Chinese!

Very interested to hear what y'all think! 

Especially re: competing theories, other evidence, etc

https://t.co/3g3Oz4y9Rc

4/

2019-12-05 at 23:28:54: Porges also ties this in to auditory processing issues -- some folks with PTSD, autism, etc find it difficult to extract voices from background noise, while simultaneously feeling hypersensitive to other sounds. 

3/

2019-12-05 at 23:28:54: Opposite for people in social engagement mode - more sensitive to voices, less to low frequencies.

Porges explains this tradeoff anatomically, in terms of how the brain regulates middle ear muscle tension:

2/ https://t.co/f9gt51xNja

2019-12-05 at 23:28:52: Trauma and auditory processing:

 Stephen Porges (polyvagal theory) writes about how people in fear states are more attuned to low frequency background noises (danger! lions! growling!) and less sensitive to the higher frequencies of human voice.

https://t.co/VdIBInKDAz

2019-11-23 at 22:03:13: @FioraAeterna @QiaochuYuan Like trying to give yourself a haircut! Most professional hairdressers don't trim the back of their own hair, as far as I know, just because the angle is so weird -- hard to see what you're doing.

2019-11-23 at 22:01:43: @FioraAeterna @QiaochuYuan Yeah. This is also where working solo / self-facilitating can be hard, and working with another person can be super helpful. 

That person can notice the blind spots, the negative spaces where your attention slides away. Structurally difficult to do when you're "in it"

2019-11-23 at 21:59:40: @FioraAeterna @QiaochuYuan Coherence Therapy approach might also be useful, in terms of... what model of the world is that resisting part holding, such that it's deeply important not to go into the aversive material? 

What's the worse harm that it's predicting, and is trying to prevent?

2019-11-23 at 21:58:04: @FioraAeterna @QiaochuYuan Some commentary from a Core Transformation workbook, on working with &amp; turning towards resistance: https://t.co/pEvNFwltzH

2019-11-23 at 21:55:50: @FioraAeterna @QiaochuYuan If this came up while I was doing a Core Transformation session with someone, I'd see if we could invite that diverting part in to a process. 

Like, "Cool, we'll leave that aversive thing there for now." And then thank the resisting part, ask it "What do you want?" etc.

2019-11-23 at 21:55:03: @FioraAeterna @QiaochuYuan Ah, cool to hear that distinction bt the unpleasant sensory experiences &amp; actively "repulsive attentional force" experiences!

Yeah. There's a bootstrapping thing here, with parts work &amp; resistance...

2019-11-23 at 21:46:30: @FioraAeterna @QiaochuYuan Mhm, yeah. I really like this blog post, with very step-by-step descriptions of what the author tried, in developing more emotional awareness:

https://t.co/NpcpAM7hkz

2019-11-23 at 21:42:01: @FioraAeterna @QiaochuYuan Like, if I were to do it, I might put some itchy wool fabric on my arm, and see if I can be with that experience. What's that like?

Maybe for just a few seconds, maybe longer next time. 

I can take it off at any time, rub my arm, and then the sensation is gone.

2019-11-23 at 21:41:33: @FioraAeterna @QiaochuYuan Hmm, good points. In terms of stepping into / being with aversive emotional experiences... might help to start with a mildly unpleasant sensory experience that you have a lot of control over?

2019-11-23 at 21:32:26: @FioraAeterna @QiaochuYuan Oh my god, I'm laughing so hard re-reading the part about his visit to the science toilet -- he is faced with an unusual situation, and ends up laughing with the guide, and feeling very cared for.

2019-11-23 at 21:27:23: @FioraAeterna @QiaochuYuan Mhm! I read an amazing interview with some of the participants &amp; guides for the U Wisconsin super high dose Pharmacokinetics of Psilocybin study... oh! Here it is. Amazing:

https://t.co/wAzkRCddUr https://t.co/orFhD63HqI

2019-11-23 at 21:16:39: @FioraAeterna @QiaochuYuan But that potential discomfort can also an opportunity to practice techniques for being with your experience, if that's what you're aiming for!

And past that, people can often lean more into "breathe, relax, let go" and get carried by the experience

2019-11-23 at 21:15:15: @FioraAeterna @QiaochuYuan And I think this can happen with other substances as well -- there's kind of a microdose (sub-perceptual), threshold barely perceptual dose, and at some point an uneasy partway-in, partway-out situation that can be quite uncomfortable...

2019-11-23 at 21:13:02: @FioraAeterna @QiaochuYuan Yup! Used to work at an ayahuasca retreat, and that's absolutely an issue. 

Titrating is interesting... they don't do it in MDMA clinical trials for PTSD, bc a 30mg "active placebo" tended to activate participants' anxiety, but didn't give the safety or oomph to work through it

2019-11-23 at 21:10:06: @QiaochuYuan @FioraAeterna -- be with the dissonance of that model &amp; your present experiences -- feel the tension of places where they can't both be "true"

-- give your internal systems the safety &amp; spaciousness to shake themselves out, reorganize, and settle back into a configuration that's a better fit

2019-11-23 at 21:09:49: @QiaochuYuan @FioraAeterna I'm really excited about how a bunch of different areas of theory &amp; practice are converging around stuff in the area of 
-- activate a deeply held, emotionally learned model of the world, relationships, self -- which was important for survival in your past environment...

2019-11-23 at 21:03:10: @QiaochuYuan @FioraAeterna Those last two are personal learning edges for me, too -- for example, I'm currently exploring the roots of my resistance to sobbing in certain contexts, and I also know there are huge areas of somatic work that I'm currently not familiar with.

2019-11-23 at 21:02:19: @QiaochuYuan @FioraAeterna Or might even get into the middle of an altered state and freak out, if they haven't already practiced ways of being with emotional intensity and allowing / letting it flow through, or turning towards resistance and welcoming what information it's bringing.

2019-11-23 at 21:01:56: @QiaochuYuan @FioraAeterna Because some people can experience breakthroughs, for example, on an ayahuasca retreat, but then have difficulty integrating insights into their day-to-day lives, or in accessing / furthering that kind of emotional healing from baseline states of consciousness.

2019-11-23 at 21:01:31: @QiaochuYuan @FioraAeterna Practices in the general area of Coherence Therapy, Bio-Emotive, Core Transformation, etc, can stand on their own, and can also help build a really solid launch pad &amp; landing pad for big intense experiences.

2019-11-23 at 21:00:30: @QiaochuYuan @FioraAeterna That's a useful comparison with MDMA therapy... looking at other modalities in terms of how close they come to those kinds of transformative results.

2019-11-22 at 23:42:06: @QiaochuYuan Man, I wonder whether the kind of presence I bring is more like Scott's or different. 

I think... it probably depends? Hmm. Now I'm wondering how to get feedback on this...

2019-11-22 at 20:55:36: @ssica3003 @alt_visa Right??? The suggested reply would totally fit in my circles as well. 

Part of me is like, "Ah yeah, it sounds stilted with all the options jammed in there together" 

And another part is like, "wait but I talk like that sometimes and endorse it, oh noooo ppl don't like me üò≥"

2019-11-21 at 22:02:58: @rfinz @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @Malcolm_Ocean @meditationstuff Because it can be interpreted as either, 'Touch is an important way of connecting' (yah!)

or 'Women's words don't matter' (yikes)

2019-11-21 at 22:00:11: @rfinz @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @Malcolm_Ocean @meditationstuff That part might be unclear. This bit later in the thread still gives me the heebie-jeebies:

"Never argue with a woman, don't even listen to her reasons for being mad. Just touch her the right way and it's all good."

2019-11-21 at 21:55:59: @rfinz @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @Malcolm_Ocean @meditationstuff Hmm... looking back at the thread, I read that as his dad and grandparents "all love it" (being hugged and/or picked up). 

I assumed his mother did not because he called it a "pacification technique" for her... no need to pacify someone who isn't upset / angry?

2019-11-21 at 21:47:50: @rfinz @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @Malcolm_Ocean @meditationstuff Totally, totally! I think it's important to distinguish bt these, and I did later in my thread. 

And, from what I can tell, the guy in the thread conflates this power-under experience with potentially power-over dynamics in his adult relationships.

https://t.co/GH6CQvWQGH

2019-11-21 at 17:39:04: @cognazor My reaction to this thread, over on thread where @nosilverv quoted it:

https://t.co/3R4JyNborp

2019-11-21 at 17:17:40: @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @Malcolm_Ocean @meditationstuff To grown people: If you hug or pick up people who DO NOT want that, you are furthering the disconnection in your relationship.

If you can do that against their will, you have some kinds of power in that relationship. Consider how you're using that.

7/

2019-11-21 at 17:16:05: @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @Malcolm_Ocean @meditationstuff And, there's a *lot* going on in that quoted thread ("When you're hugging your mom, she can't hit you hard"). 

To child version of spooky-cat-abs-man -- hell yeah on your self-preservation tactics in a hostile environment. 

6/

2019-11-21 at 17:07:26: @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @Malcolm_Ocean @meditationstuff So, I figure that offering touch as part of reconnecting after a tense interaction can be great.

Engaging in mutually wanted touch, taking in each other person's experience, checking in if there's tension, hugging til relaxed, that's great. Limbic regulation. 

5/

2019-11-21 at 17:01:30: @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @Malcolm_Ocean @meditationstuff My relationship with touch, especially close platonic touch, is... still kind of fucked up, and I think those experiences contributed.

4/

2019-11-21 at 17:00:17: @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @Malcolm_Ocean @meditationstuff She'd scream at me, then eventually hug me to show (herself?) that it was okay.

I hated it, would be stiff and resistant every time. And I felt trapped, couldn't get away.

3/

2019-11-21 at 16:59:50: @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @Malcolm_Ocean @meditationstuff Aaand... some part of me was hissing and hackles raised at the idea in the thread that hugs are a good way to end arguments and control women's anger.

Especially because that's what my mom did to me as a child. 

2/

2019-11-21 at 16:51:46: @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @Malcolm_Ocean @meditationstuff Oh jeez. I feel sad, thinking about schools defaulting to banning touch, and figure it's tied in with a whole bunch of issues we experience as a culture.

Want kids to have more space for hugs, cuddles, etc, and learning how to navigate disagreements &amp; "don't touch me!"

Other times, I feel my diaphragm area muscles constrict and my breathing get shallower when I'm feeling upset, regardless of pants.

3/

2019-11-21 at 07:33:05: I might notice, "Oh, I'm breathing shallowly. I feel some constriction there. I feel tense, I feel anxious..."

Sometimes, I then realize, "Wait a minute. These pants are actually kind of snug."

2/

2019-11-21 at 07:33:05: Context: Lately, I've been putting a lot more attention towards practices that translate between emotions and felt visceral sensations.

2019-11-21 at 07:33:05: Do you notice feeling anxious when you wear pants that are snug or tight at the waist?

2019-11-21 at 02:38:23: @QiaochuYuan I'm not going to even try to dig deeper into this right now, especially with the whole replication crisis thing. 

If other folks know whether there is useful data on this, curious to hear!

8/

2019-11-21 at 02:37:21: @QiaochuYuan For example, a highly cited paper:

"Lower precombat intelligence is a risk factor for posttraumatic stress disorder" (Macklin et al 1998)

But also:

"High intelligence: A risk factor for psychological and physiological overexcitabilities" (Karpinski et al 2018)

7/

2019-11-21 at 02:36:43: @QiaochuYuan Do we actually know what the distribution looks like in the population, and whether there's a relationship between intelligence &amp; trauma?

*shrug*

At first glance, there are papers that go both ways.

6/

2019-11-21 at 02:25:06: @QiaochuYuan Maybe you're not counting brilliant happy people -- they're off somewhere else in deeply fulfilling world-saving flow states. (Or something???)

Maybe you're not counting extremely traumatized low intelligence people -- they might be, like, in prison or hospital or ?

5/

2019-11-21 at 02:16:55: @QiaochuYuan But Qiaochu is suggesting, with Berkson's paradox -- maybe you're drawing your sample from a narrow range of functionality.

If so, you might see a trend, while the general population could be scattered all over the map, with no causal relationship bt intelligence &amp; trauma.

4/

2019-11-21 at 02:15:56: @QiaochuYuan "Does being intelligent make you more vulnerable to trauma? Are less smart people more resilient - maybe they don't overthink it?

Or, awful thought, does trauma force you to become smarter to overcome it?"

3/

2019-11-21 at 02:15:26: @QiaochuYuan You might look around you and think, "Dang, it seems like all the intelligent people I know are extremely traumatized. And folks with less general smarts seem happier &amp; less traumatized."

2/

2019-11-21 at 02:14:41: @QiaochuYuan Took me a few minutes of staring at this to get it, and then I got all caught up in it and decided to make some images. 

Wanting to check that I'm clear on it:

1/

2019-11-21 at 02:12:16: @QiaochuYuan Qiaochu, does this match what you were picturing?

Images: Graphs showing Berkson's paradox, where 
"ability to function = intelligence - trauma"

Can look like more intelligent folks are always more traumatized &amp; vice versa, but might be missing data from wider population https://t.co/TdXZrQbWIs

2019-11-20 at 21:24:08: @nosilverv Interoception, I guess, is also not just strictly sensations from the "viscera" (internal organs in the trunk of the body). 

It also includes sensory information from a few other pathways, and the vagus nerve, which is a whole emotional processing thing!

https://t.co/UJTMwJeQFQ

2019-11-20 at 21:21:16: @nosilverv Aha! Found the journal article on Somatic Experiencing &amp; interoception (internal visceral sensations, as opposed to musculo-skeletal sensations)

Small bit of data - there's some fascinating influences of Gregory Bateson &amp; R.D. Laing being referenced in the Coherence Therapy material.

I tried using "psychoneuroendocrinoimmunology" as an incantation to ward off some extremely confused metaphors around physical health and emotional wellbeing

but alas

they fired me for being too rational

2019-11-15 at 04:59:16: @mrgunn @Malcolm_Ocean @TheAnnaGat @Timber_22 @JimmyRis @StewartalsopIII @MalcolmOcean I'm deliberately using a non-technical phrase of "biochemical systems out of whack" because good lord here we are deep in the waters of psychoneuroendocrinoimmunology

Is releasing muscle tension via emotional releasing techniques an effective leverage point to treat stress-related illnesses?

2019-11-15 at 04:52:05: @mrgunn @Malcolm_Ocean @TheAnnaGat @Timber_22 @JimmyRis @StewartalsopIII @MalcolmOcean Does muscle tension cause illness absent biochemical stuff being out of whack? 

(Trivially, yeah - TMJ issues, back pain, etc. But maybe you mean other kinds of illness?)

(Also, does chronic muscle tension exist absent biochemical stuff being out of whack? A good question...)

2019-11-15 at 04:51:45: @mrgunn @Malcolm_Ocean @TheAnnaGat @Timber_22 @JimmyRis @StewartalsopIII @MalcolmOcean So folks could ask:

Is chronic psychogenic muscle tension a useful indicator of suppressed stress that the patient might not be consciously reporting?

2019-11-15 at 04:51:30: @mrgunn @Malcolm_Ocean @TheAnnaGat @Timber_22 @JimmyRis @StewartalsopIII @MalcolmOcean I know there are a lot of other branches on this thread, and I'm wondering -- which links in the chain of causality are you wanting to look at?

2019-11-08 at 19:23:33: @jameswjesso E.g. Morgan Freeman: ‚ÄúIf you‚Äôre looking to improve the sound of your voice, yawn a lot. It relaxes your throat muscles. It relaxes your vocal chords. And as soon as they relax, the tone drops. The lower your voice is, the better you sound.‚Äù

https://t.co/YakIM9Pdha

2019-11-08 at 19:22:53: @jameswjesso Yawning is also sometimes used as a vocal warm-up (prior to singing, etc). 

So I wonder whether yawning could be usefully understood as part of the more general stretching that people often feel moved to do as part of psychedelic experiences, emotional releases, &amp; bodywork.

2019-11-07 at 02:40:30: This is assuming that the yoga would involve short instructions, with long pauses between. Maybe more yin yoga?

And the podcast audio would need to be paused briefly for each yoga bit, then restarted as smoothly as possible. Not muted or talked over.

2019-11-07 at 02:40:30: #ThingIWantToExist: 

App that takes the audio from minimalist yoga routines and inserts it into a podcast / recording of your choice. 

So you'd start with, say, an hour-long podcast, and end up listening to it in like 1:10 while also being guided through a yoga sequence.

What kinds of changes are you avoiding, that would cause your public Twitter to become girly?

What's your model of what would happen, if it did become girly?

2019-11-06 at 20:51:57: @Malcolm_Ocean @ponekarl For example, when I got a tattoo -- I experienced pain, but not suffering. 

Or if I'm experiencing cognitive dissonance, I have the opportunity to see that as suffering (fear of madness), or as part of a learning process (necessary for conceptual &amp; emotional reorganization).

2019-11-06 at 20:50:04: @Malcolm_Ocean @ponekarl Yah. To build on the quoted tweet -- it's not a binary distinction where prior to enlightenment, all pain is suffering, and you have to become 100% enlightened before you can do anything about it.

Totally possible to shift the meaning of sensations, incrementally &amp; dynamically.

2019-11-01 at 21:50:21: @ncasenmare @mykola I found this book summary very helpful for understanding the general shape of this approach:

https://t.co/qTOmblIgpq

2019-11-01 at 21:49:42: @ncasenmare @mykola There's also a therapy method based on PCT, called the "Method of Levels." 

I haven't read much about that, but I have been looking into Coherence Therapy. It looks at emotional reconsolidation (which is compatible with the PCT idea of "learning" as "reorganization").

2019-11-01 at 21:48:30: @ncasenmare @mykola I've had this tweet up in a browser tab for a while, intending to make a big involved reply -- seems that's not happening, so I'll just make some brief notes:

2019-11-01 at 20:45:49: @QiaochuYuan And like also... this is not actually intended to be a "do-it-yourself" thing, as far as I can tell. 

It's really hard / kind of incompatible to stay blended with a part and simultaneously have meta insight on the scene. Recording &amp; re-listening might help separate those?

2019-11-01 at 20:43:46: @QiaochuYuan Mhm, yeah. I may also try &amp; do some other thing to see if I feel meta-unsafe with the process in that moment, and to address that first.

2019-11-01 at 20:41:45: @xuenay Yes! Sounds a lot like how (in Iain McGilchrist's model) the left hemisphere is optimizing for pattern-matching, looking for stuff that fits with expectations.

And that's efficient in a lot of contexts (daily routines, etc) but not when you're trying to be emotionally surprised!

2019-11-01 at 20:17:41: And if you were reading this whole thead hoping to learn more about real-life aircraft chaff (and you didn't google it already?), here ya go:

https://t.co/Cg9MsiGdSq

2019-11-01 at 20:17:40: (P.S. there are more steps to the emotional coherence framework that I haven't described -- simultaneously experiencing a disconfirming schema, feeling dissonance, emotional reconsolidation, verification...)

https://t.co/MggxaXhzer

11/

2019-11-01 at 20:17:40: That being said, I'm still interested enough in the "intellectual deflection chaff" metaphor to post this thread. 

Basically: there's an emotionally resonant insight missile honing in, and the left hemisphere freaks out and slings plausible decoys to try &amp; deflect it.

10/

2019-11-01 at 20:17:40: (Hmm... I'm not fully satisfied with that example list of reasons, because they're all a little bit too coherent with each other to really convey the experience I'm pointing at, of a bunch of mutually exclusive plausible reasons that are all over the place.)

9/

2019-11-01 at 20:17:40: Is the deeply resonant reason among those? The one that will be surprising, transformative, mind-blowing to recognize? 

I don't know! Because in that moment, I'm not actually in touch with the part of me that could tell.

8/

2019-11-01 at 20:17:39: - I wasted all past times that I spent feeling bad about the thing

- I'm endorsing what happened as fine and okay

- I'll never learn to act differently in those situations

- I'm a bad person for allowing the thing to keep happening in the world

Etc!

7/

2019-11-01 at 20:17:39: Ex: If I allow myself to feel better about the thing, then... 

- People won't know how their actions hurt me, and they won't change

- My original reason for feeling hurt was invalid

- No one will help/comfort me

- I'll have to feel better about all similar future things

6/

2019-11-01 at 20:17:39: This is what I'm tentatively calling "intellectual deflection chaff." 

Like, for any given pattern, some part of me (left hemisphere?) can make up a dozen totally plausible reasons. 

5/

2019-11-01 at 20:17:39: Note that I'm not trying to give sufficient detail here for anyone to "do the thing" -- just enough to point at a specific failure mode I've seen in myself.

At this point, if I'm not "blended" enough with that part, some other part of me will jump in &amp; start making shit up. 

4/

2019-11-01 at 20:17:38: You activate that part, imagining in detail the situations that generate the pattern.

You speak from that emotional resonance ("blending," probably?), in response to various prompts, to find out what the "symptom-requiring schema" is. 

3/

2019-11-01 at 20:17:38: (See also Unlocking the Emotional Brain)

The practice involves looking at a thought/feeling/behavior pattern, and holding that it's happening for some deep reason. 

Some part is operating from a model of the world in which that pattern is crucial to prevent worse suffering.

2/

2019-11-01 at 20:17:38: Intellectual deflections as "chaff"!

If an aircraft is threatened by a radar-guided missile, it can release a cloud of metal bits (chaff) as a confusing decoy. 

In exploring the Coherence Therapy manual, I've found a similar pattern in my own mental defense systems.

2019-10-29 at 20:53:47: @RebeccaRHelm Omg I love this flail artichoke! ‚ô•Ô∏è

2019-10-29 at 17:55:04: @misen__ @xuenay @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @meditationstuff To be clear -- it's "WTF is going on in these other NVC learning spaces such that people are acting in a way that's so different from my understanding of the integrity of this practice?"

And is that the norm? Was my experience an unusual exception?

2019-10-29 at 17:50:40: @misen__ @xuenay @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @meditationstuff It was a huge step for me in breaking out of family dynamics (that I'm still untangling). 

And so when I hear that people have encountered "NVC" as "Now you have to meet my needs" or "You have to talk a certain way for me to hear you," I'm like, WTF?!?!

2019-10-29 at 17:49:17: @misen__ @xuenay @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @meditationstuff Learning &amp; practicing NVC with that group was the very first time that I got the message, "Your needs matter, and your feelings are important indicators of needs that are met or unmet, and you can talk about this."

2019-10-29 at 17:46:04: @misen__ @xuenay @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @meditationstuff (Now, whether I've integrated that fully is another question!)

And I've encountered so many people who report coercive rules-lawyering from people using NVC, and I feel... at first confused, and then a kind of heaviness, and a raw, torn-up feeling.

2019-10-29 at 17:44:11: @misen__ @xuenay @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @meditationstuff I learned it through the Georgia Conflict Center, and definitely got the message that, regardless of what someone is saying, the skillful move is to translate that internally so that you can receive the important information without taking on self-blame.

2019-10-29 at 17:42:17: @misen__ @xuenay @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @meditationstuff Yeah. Seems likely that there are cultural differences in how the NVC framework has been taught &amp; practiced in different groups and areas, as it spread out from Rosenberg's original source material.

2019-10-29 at 05:07:26: @Timber_22 @VincentBarr @xuenay @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @meditationstuff @Malcolm_Ocean @peternlimberg - I bet this whole thread comparing Imago Dialogue &amp; other practices is relevant to your interests! 

I added Imago to the conversational modalities Google doc as well

2019-10-29 at 04:52:58: @QiaochuYuan @DRMacIver Not sobbing in a distraught way, but in a "that was so satisfying and strangely affirming and it seems I really needed that" way.

2019-10-29 at 04:52:37: @QiaochuYuan @DRMacIver Also, appreciating you tagging me in this!

The night I started reading the fanfic, I did not expect that I'd stay up past 5am to finish it. That's what happened, and I was sobbing and blowing my nose at the end, and it felt so good. üò≠ ‚ô•Ô∏è

2019-10-29 at 04:49:15: @QiaochuYuan @DRMacIver Mostly yes. I'm trying to figure out whether one of the pivotal show scenes they reference in the fanfic is actually in the book... it may not be?

Also the characterization of Crowley &amp; his relation to trauma is somewhat different between the book &amp; show

2019-10-29 at 01:29:16: @Timber_22 @VincentBarr @xuenay @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @meditationstuff @Malcolm_Ocean I guess... hm, what does the Imago framework hold as falling under "shaming, blaming, or criticizing"?

2019-10-29 at 01:25:55: @Timber_22 @VincentBarr @xuenay @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @meditationstuff @Malcolm_Ocean I'm thinking about statements like "I feel abandoned / abused / betrayed" (etc). 

Bio-Emotive would welcome these as interpersonal feelings en route to core feelings, &amp; NVC or Circling would reframe as "I have a story that..." or invite expressing associated sadness, anger, etc.

2019-10-29 at 01:24:14: @Timber_22 @VincentBarr @xuenay @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @meditationstuff @Malcolm_Ocean I'm wanting to understand more about the difference bt Imago and NVC approaches to "I feel" statements.

I'm seeing that in Imago, the Sender "should avoid shaming, blaming or criticizing their partner, and instead talk about themselves." https://t.co/AfBPuWHL6h

2019-10-29 at 01:23:15: @Timber_22 @VincentBarr @xuenay @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @meditationstuff @Malcolm_Ocean (Not quite sure how to care for threading here, as I'm also interested in Malcolm's book question.)

I read the Imago doc you linked -- very reminiscent of the reflection / "is that it?" / "is there more?" structure from Restorative Circles, which I really like working with!

2019-10-29 at 00:10:59: @VincentBarr @Malcolm_Ocean Sometimes these just need different containers (different listeners) as you described.

2019-10-29 at 00:08:42: @VincentBarr @Malcolm_Ocean Mhm! 

That's exactly what we're looking at in the linked thread...

What kinds of practices avoid provoking listener defensiveness -

And what practices help the speaker get in touch with what they're deeply feeling, which may involve wading through a blame swamp?

2019-10-28 at 23:59:36: In the example dialogue I linked to at the top of this thread, I described Bob &amp; Alice getting into this 2-person trap (accusation / defensiveness)

I described them escaping the trap through talking with other trusted friends, feeling heard, and then coming back into dialogue

2019-10-28 at 23:59:36: Both of those strategies completely undermine and interfere with collaborative sense-making &amp; calibration &amp; navigation! 

Nearly impossible to escape self-reinforcing confusion tangles in an isolated 2-person system, if those patterns are present.

2019-10-28 at 23:59:36: Under coercive / authoritarian culture, people often develop unconscious strategies of:

- Undermining their own self-trust to preserve relationships ‚û°Ô∏è to stay safe

- Or undermining other people's self-trust to maintain control &amp; power ‚û°Ô∏è to stay safe

2019-10-28 at 23:59:35: So 2 people *can* attempt that move, if they're already working from a culture / mindset of seeking a collaborative 3D view of the situation.

Sometimes it's necessary to have more trusted folks involved, though, because of blind spots.

2019-10-28 at 23:48:35: The human sense-making equivalent would be more like coherent parallax. 

Say you've got 2 different perspectives on an issue, 2 different ways of telling the story &amp; meaning of what happened. 

You can either fight about it, or try &amp; get the 3D view:

https://t.co/JmsqNdTudw

2019-10-28 at 23:48:34: If all you've got is those 2, ain't much you can do.

You definitely, definitely need to get some more pH meters involved, along with some kind of procedures, to navigate that calibration in a useful way.

https://t.co/JZMKNRYONs

2019-10-28 at 23:48:34: Hint: It often takes more than just 2 people! 

It's incredibly, structurally difficult to do this (or most kinds of sense-making) in a 2-person system in isolation. 

It's like saying, "Well, this pH meter says 7.1, and this one says 6.8... which one's right?"

2019-10-28 at 23:35:27: How can we care for both:

- Being able to totally fucking express what's coming up for you

- Actually being heard by the receiver of that, instead of putting them on the defensive

(A thread on the live edge of navigating different frameworks for communication &amp; emotional work) https://t.co/S5gxaDiTT9

2019-10-28 at 23:24:46: @Timber_22 @xuenay @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @meditationstuff @Malcolm_Ocean Then maybe Bob &amp; Alice are in a better space to hear each other &amp; for feedback to flow effectively.

Alice can actually take in the impact of her actions on Bob, and Bob can hear more about what was present for Alice when she acted the way she did.

7/

2019-10-28 at 23:23:31: @Timber_22 @xuenay @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @meditationstuff @Malcolm_Ocean Alternative: 

Carl to Bob: "I can hold space for that, Bob."

Bob to Carl - pours everything out there, feels received, feels relief, feels more spaciousness

Maybe someone else talks with Alice until she feels more emotional safety as well

6/

2019-10-28 at 23:21:51: @Timber_22 @xuenay @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @meditationstuff @Malcolm_Ocean Say Bob feels betrayed by Alice, feels sad and scared, and feels alone and helpless.

Bob: "Alice, I feel deeply betrayed by you."

Alice: "Hold up - that's not what I intended!"

Alice feels defensive; Bob feels it's not okay to express, compounding the trauma/stuckness 

5/

2019-10-28 at 23:09:50: @Timber_22 @xuenay @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @meditationstuff @Malcolm_Ocean Another way is to create a specific container for totally unfettered expression. 

The receiver is prepared to just be present, without feeling any need to compete for being seen and understood. 

Happens in therapy &amp; in practices where someone facilitates (Bio-Emotive, etc)

4/

2019-10-28 at 23:05:53: @Timber_22 @xuenay @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @meditationstuff @Malcolm_Ocean Many ways to navigate this, and I don't yet have a full understanding of what's possible. 

NVC &amp; Circling (etc) care for #3 by offering framings like, "I have a story that..."

But sometimes this blocks #1, especially if the meta tag or group pressures get in the way 

3/

2019-10-28 at 23:02:29: @Timber_22 @xuenay @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @meditationstuff @Malcolm_Ocean 1) The expresser needs to be able to activate and resonate with emotional schemas

2) The expresser needs to feel received and welcomed in that revealing

For that to happen:

3) The receiver(s) need to be able to be present with what's being revealed

2/

2019-10-28 at 23:01:42: @Timber_22 @xuenay @nosilverv @QiaochuYuan @meditationstuff Mhm! This is an active conversation with me &amp; @Malcolm_Ocean &amp; others.

2019-10-01 at 18:23:04: @themarcusnewton And there are ways of presenting data that make it easier or more difficult to understand and interact with huge complex systems. 

Climate change is a complex system, and there are a lot of ineffective &amp; unsatisfying ways of trying to work with it that might lead to despair.

2019-10-01 at 18:12:51: @themarcusnewton If so, I'm pointing at a different angle on it. 

I'm looking at "scope insensitivity," a general observation about how our minds tend to work. 

Really understanding, in a visceral way, the difference bt a million and a billion - it doesn't come naturally, and it's learnable.

2019-10-01 at 18:11:29: @themarcusnewton Mm, I'm taking that in as, you're seeing a generational gap in people taking in the scale of the issue, as in -- how much does this matter, how big is the issue, how important is it, how deeply do I care? 

Is that what you're pointing at?

2019-10-01 at 03:38:57: Understanding radiation, from xkcd -- maybe not so much for little kids, with this one.

2019-09-30 at 23:50:50: @QiaochuYuan @uncatherio @RealtimeAI @diviacaroline @made_in_cosmos There are lots of online resources for thinking about scale &amp; systems (visualizations, demos, Fermi estimates, etc) - worth collecting those in a thread!

2019-09-30 at 23:49:11: @QiaochuYuan @uncatherio @RealtimeAI @diviacaroline @made_in_cosmos And like... I could imagine exploring this with kids bc my academic background is in ecology, with experience in env activism besides.

Not sure how to bootstrap / scale that capacity more broadly for parents, mentors, etc. Reach out to folks in city planning, grad students?

2019-09-30 at 23:45:05: @QiaochuYuan @uncatherio @RealtimeAI @diviacaroline @made_in_cosmos - A sense of leverage points and agency.

If they're playing in a creek and a leaky pipe crosses it, what is that? Who's responsible? Who can you contact to find out more?

If you run into blocks, what's that about? How'd the system get that way? What alternatives are possible?

2019-09-30 at 23:41:52: @QiaochuYuan @uncatherio @RealtimeAI @diviacaroline @made_in_cosmos - A sense of scale and systems, topic areas prompted by the kid's interest. (Deeply exploring the "why?" &amp; "how?" questions!)

What's even *is* a kg or megatonne of CO2? How much CO2 do we exhale every day? How much does a tree absorb? How big of an area is 1000 trees?

2019-09-30 at 23:36:41: @QiaochuYuan @uncatherio @RealtimeAI @diviacaroline @made_in_cosmos Big question, about how to talk with kids re: Earth, environment, climate

A few components that I'd like to see more of:

- Hands-on experiences of exploring ecosystems.

Ideally a mix of local, frequently visited (ex: urban creek) + diverse ecosystems (ex: forest, big park)

it could still be possible for some coercive group to form within the #GameB social space, that took on the buzzwords of the new mindset, but was out of integrity with actually implementing &amp; deeply living from these ideas.

Def. a need for a memetic immune system!

2019-09-30 at 19:11:59: @GameB_Phil @crowddemocracy @Meaningness @meditationstuff @cosimia_ All this being said, from what I can see of Game B, it doesn't match my sense of cult dynamics. 

- There's no centralized control

- There's an emphasis on individual sovereignty &amp; sense-making as fundamental components of group sovereignty

2019-09-30 at 19:05:18: @GameB_Phil @crowddemocracy @Meaningness has some notes on The Guru Papers, a book that looks at this big cultural question (authoritarian power) by focusing on the distilled example of guru dynamics:

https://t.co/aFA9m7YBlJ

3/

2019-09-30 at 19:03:06: @GameB_Phil @crowddemocracy One of the first things I think about is, "Does this group / culture / mindset fundamentally undermine self-trust through authoritarian power?"

It's complex because our default culture does this too. 

Happens in "established" religions, in families, companies...

2/

2019-09-30 at 19:00:13: @GameB_Phil @crowddemocracy Finding myself wondering, what dynamics are y'all looking at, that are leading to that question? 

And relatedly, what's your model of a cult? How would you tell if a group was a cult? 

A few links and references:

What kind of wizardry is this!üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

(if you look at 10 cents vs $10 per hour)

2019-09-27 at 00:51:46: @trysonix @_SimonLau @TrintHQ @otter_ai This is something I legit don't understand. My guesses are:

- VC magic, where Otter is running at a loss

- Tech magic, where Otter can somehow do it way cheaper

- If I'm not paying, I *am* the product, and ((hrrm datamining something something yikes))

2019-09-27 at 00:50:02: @trysonix @_SimonLau Oho, a competitor appears! 

Ok, but for real - why is the pricing for @trysonix and @TrintHQ around $5-15/hr,

while @otter_ai can somehow do automated transcripts at free for 10hr/month, and then their paid plans start at like 10 CENTS per hour? (~$10/mo for 100hr)

Basically, you can:

- Export the highlighted text
- Share snippets of text

And can't yet export just audio highlights.

2019-09-26 at 21:22:27: @_SimonLau @Malcolm_Ocean Amazing!

I tried it out, and -- it looks like I can listen to the highlights in-app, and export highlighted text, but I'm not seeing an "Export audio" option for the highlights? https://t.co/ZSMpgGkBpd

2019-09-26 at 21:08:51: @ESYudkowsky @C4C_Recruiting @AgustinLebron3 I figure you're probably just saying 'sub in keto desserts for sugar-added desserts while still eating other carbs like fruit' -- 

and also worth pointing out that folks advise very strongly against keto diet in pregnancy ("serious problems" for babies):

https://t.co/TtPsm8m0Lo

2019-09-26 at 20:33:54: Also of interest to @Malcolm_Ocean!

2019-09-26 at 20:32:28: I guess in some cases, "export audio without highlighted sections" would be slightly more convenient, but less intuitive.

2019-09-26 at 20:32:28: My group's main use case: we want to share some of our audio recordings with wider audiences, and sometimes need to edit out sections that are less relevant, missing background context, or sensitive in some way that's not a good fit for wide distribution.

2019-09-26 at 20:32:27: Came out of a convo with @GwendolynHuot, and possibly also of interest for @chrxn, @Conaw, @tasshinfogleman &amp; @dthorson (especially re: progressive summarization!)

2019-09-26 at 20:32:27: Ooh! A feature request for @otter_ai / @_SimonLau:

‚ú®Export audio highlights‚ú®

User highlights text in the transcript, and then can export the audio that corresponds to just the highlighted sections, as one single mp3.

I'd switch to a Premium plan for this feature!

https://t.co/a4wfceXzn0

2019-09-25 at 02:56:19: @HunterBergsma @reasonisfun @jonnym1ller @Malcolm_Ocean And I want to pull out &amp; emphasize a couple Zak Stein quotes:

"And it doesn't mean the teacher knows, but it means that you have a thought partner who can lead you, and you feel safe not knowing. 

[...] he or she is the one who you trust with your lack of knowledge."

2019-09-25 at 02:53:53: @HunterBergsma @reasonisfun @jonnym1ller @Malcolm_Ocean Because I know that I am the sort of being who can experience perceptual impairments, cognitive distortions, blind spots. 

And so I need some context in which I can hear, "Hey, pause and look around, recalibrate." I need to be able to take in feedback, in order to learn.

2019-09-25 at 02:51:40: @HunterBergsma @reasonisfun @jonnym1ller @Malcolm_Ocean Oh! This is interesting. 

It relates to self-trust, and also to the question of, how do you develop a non-naive trust in what Zak Stein would call a "teacherly authority"?

How do you trust someone with your lack of knowledge?

Zak Stein transcript: https://t.co/kXiHW2tFEa https://t.co/2Aew1ZFzQ9

2019-09-24 at 23:10:05: @QiaochuYuan ‚ô•Ô∏è 

Oof, yeah. 

Reading your thread, I'm thinking of this piece from Nora Bateson. What's out there, past fear, past hope, into a space of not-knowing? 

And not a vague, abstracted, conceptual not-knowing, but a visceral, embodied, sticky not-knowing:

https://t.co/IYLtz3G8oZ

2019-09-24 at 20:10:21: 6. An afterparty space that has a wider range of options for interaction. It was so loud that I stayed outside the building the whole time. üòï 

Providing earplugs would help a bit... didn't see any at harm reduction table. üëÇ

19/

2019-09-24 at 20:10:21: 3. Offer name tags, even just a pile of blank ones with markers. 

4. Better ventilation in the conference hall, if at all possible. 

5. A large poster/map of nearby places to go get lunch.

18/

2019-09-24 at 20:10:21: 1. Have a poster session. A great way for early-career folks to present their research, and it provides opportunities for 1-on-1 rich conversations.

2. More time &amp; space for attendee or small-group conversations, in general, would've been great. 

17/

2019-09-24 at 20:10:21: I enjoyed the overall experience of the conference, which included going out to dinner with a few other attendees, and talking with folks at the afterparty. 

I do have some suggestions for future events -- and I'd be glad to volunteer!

16/

2019-09-24 at 20:10:20: And I was excited to talk with folks from @remedy_hello! 

Remedy is a space in Toronto that's hosting MDMA therapy research. Of course, they don't offer psychedelic therapy outside of that, but they do work with integration and trauma therapy.
https://t.co/wdrSsG9YNV

15/

2019-09-24 at 20:10:20: @MendelKaelen gave a talk about @wavepaths, a generative music experience designed to be an aid to psychedelic therapy, and also a form of therapy in itself. 

Wish I'd made it to the Wavepaths pop-up event, and I'm looking forward to the app being released!

14/

2019-09-24 at 20:10:19: The part about the "window of tolerance" for therapy is fascinating, and I want to look into this more. 

(Photos aren't the best, unfortunately, as I was off to the side.)

13/ https://t.co/56gupKEAe5

2019-09-24 at 20:10:17: The presentation from Dr. Emma Hapke (UT) &amp; Dr. Simon Amar (Montreal) was great!

So glad they were able to invite a participant in the MDMA therapy trials to talk about his experience onstage. He was beaming, and said he found a lot of meaning &amp; purpose through sharing it!

12/

2019-09-24 at 20:10:16: Dr. Tobin is very concerned about not repeating the '60s moves that led to a backlash against psychedelic research and therapy. 

I agree with a lot of his specific points, &amp; I don't resonate with some parts of his overall position. And I hope TheraPsil has complete success!

11/ https://t.co/RNRSrODVmr

2019-09-24 at 20:10:14: To me, that kind of closes down possible conversations around, what would we like to see as the long-term future of psychedelic experiences? How do these fit into our culture? Into communities? 

Also harm reduction, peer support, indigenous and shamanic practices...

10/

2019-09-24 at 20:10:14: The difference I see, is that when people from MAPS (etc) talk about regulation and credentialing, I usually hear that as being the current strategic path, and the most feasible path.

I got the sense that Dr. Tobin was holding it as the only correct path, the "right" path. 

9/

2019-09-24 at 20:10:14: And... there was also a way in which I didn't resonate with part of Dr. Tobin's presentation. 

I agree that there are many issues that can arise from the use of psychedelics in contexts that don't support safety, wellbeing, clear thinking, and integration.

8/

2019-09-24 at 20:10:13: I'm still very excited about TheraPsil and what's likely to be made possible by their efforts.

@PaulLewinLawyer described the legal considerations clearly and energetically, and it sounds like he's bringing a lot of solid experience with cannabis legalization to the table. 

7/

2019-09-24 at 20:10:13: I was looking forward to seeing Dr. Bruce Tobin's presentations about TheraPsil. He's petitioning Health Canada for an exemption to treat end-of-life anxiety with psilocybin, and has a multi-part court plan if they deny the application.

2019-09-24 at 20:10:13: A guy in the audience asked questions about psychedelics inducing synesthesia. 

Nichols replied that he knew of one synesthete who'd taken LSD, and his synesthesia temporarily disappeared during the experience!

https://t.co/ifRtzZwPVW

5/

2019-09-24 at 20:10:12: Far as I can tell, LSD docks into the receptor and pulls a flap of protein over itself like a blanket, and that's why it sticks in there for a long time and is effective at such tiny doses. Has implications for understanding tolerance and microdosing.

https://t.co/BdBaFc93lS

4/

2019-09-24 at 20:10:12: Dr. David Nichols presented some highly technical LSD receptor biochemistry. 

I could follow it because he'd given a Skype presentation to the UGA Psychedelic Club a couple years ago, but most of the audience was probably lost. 

3/

2019-09-24 at 20:10:12: @atomstrauss gave hilarious and high-energy speaker intros and transitions, and helped keep the flow going. 

I wish more conferences would embrace comedians as MCs!

2019-09-24 at 02:33:59: @jonnym1ller Working with the not-knowing: "How can we set ourselves up for resilience in volatile / uncertain / complex / ambiguous situations?"

"How can we create a context where there's space and appetite to reveal what we're thinking &amp; feeling, and space to ask - to guess and check?"

2019-09-24 at 02:33:46: @jonnym1ller Several of the common CBT cognitive distortions are deeply related to not-knowing: "fortune telling" and "mind-reading". 

Practicing sitting with not-knowing: "I don't know for sure what the future holds" and "I don't know for sure what that person is thinking"

2019-09-24 at 02:33:30: @jonnym1ller Other folks might jump to collapse not-knowing prematurely into the closest adjacent knowing, even if that's not a very good fit. 

Like someone who always has to have an answer, but often "bullshits" it, maybe having come from situations where "I don't know" was punished.

2019-09-24 at 02:32:40: @jonnym1ller Sometimes, folks feel so unsafe with not-knowing that they build up unconscious patterns to avoid noticing it.

With the example of asking about a word definition, I figure that could be a way to lean into noticing when you don't know. And it often has a quick &amp; simple resolution

2019-09-24 at 02:31:39: @jonnym1ller This is a question I think about &amp; work with a lot!

Seems there are at least a few stages:

- Being able to notice not-knowing

- Being able to sit with the not-knowing

- Artistic co-creation with the not-knowing - what does that space make possible?

2019-09-19 at 17:47:51: I like "perplexed joyful despair" as one of the many new colors we're going to need in our emotional palette, for navigating collapse, chaos &amp; complexity.

2019-09-17 at 17:27:55: @danlistensto @GwendolynHuot @WisdomRebel @chrxn From that video, they talk about kinds of blocking perspectives that "lead only to unreconcilable entropic conflict" -- and if those aren't capable of or interested in forming "heterogeneous coherence", then they're not a good bet to try &amp; collab with at this time

2019-09-17 at 17:22:50: @GwendolynHuot @chrxn @danlistensto @aaronzlewis, I figure you might enjoy this convo about hyperobjects!

2019-09-17 at 17:21:33: @GwendolynHuot @chrxn @danlistensto And, of course, humans are different from pixels or neurons, in that we can do various moves of imagination. 

So in that way, we can both experience our tiny tiny corner of experience - standing up and sitting down - and also seeing the big wave move through the stadium

2019-09-17 at 17:20:14: @GwendolynHuot @chrxn @danlistensto The tricky part is...

"human being" is to "hyperobject" as "pixel" is to "cellular automaton"

or as "neuron" is to "brain"

Imagine a little pixel, flickering on and off. The only info it has is about its state -- how can it possibly see how that forms the bigger picture?

2019-09-17 at 17:17:07: @GwendolynHuot @chrxn @danlistensto Oooof, yeah. I've had very visceral / multisensory experiences of being part of hyperobjects. 

The vividness &amp; embodiedness, for me, mostly only comes up in altered states -- and I can still connect to most of "what follows from that" in my baseline state of being.

2019-09-17 at 17:12:44: @danlistensto @GwendolynHuot @WisdomRebel @chrxn "Parallax" is also beautifully illustrated in Unflattening by @Nsousanis - here are 2 excerpt pages from his site:

2019-09-06 at 02:10:18: @thewiseturtle So I think the answer to "Why not all make all activities non-profit?" is at least partly "Because of IRS rules."

Example: MAPS is primarily a 501(c)(3) &amp; they found it necessary to set up a wholly owned subsidiary B corp due to some IRS regulations:

https://t.co/9npW6CmjXV

2019-09-06 at 02:09:21: @thewiseturtle There's so much I don't know about this area, and also... the thing about nonprofits is that they're generally tax-exempt, and their activities are subject to various limitations if they want to keep that tax-exempt status.

2019-09-05 at 19:14:39: @temujin9 @danlistensto Appreciating these contexts &amp; perspectives! 

A lot of this area has been a "known unknown" for me, in terms of - what are the large-scale drivers and constraints of motivation, responsibility, decision-making in big corporations?

2019-09-05 at 17:53:21: Public-benefit corporations have been one attempt at fixing this issue, explicitly prioritizing certain care-abouts over maximizing profit. 

For example, @MAPS has a B corp to do the FDA drug development process for MDMA-assisted therapy

https://t.co/bxfZCiDNIt

2019-09-05 at 17:50:04: I've heard that corporations have a legal requirement to "maximize shareholder profit" &amp; that limits their capacity to care for workers, environment, etc.

2019-08-23 at 22:39:46: @rfinz Oh no! Umm... swim sideways to the rip current of Wikipedia and nautical metaphors!

(oh nooo there goes another one)

2019-08-23 at 22:37:18: @rfinz Yeah! I have not actually interacted with sails &amp; rudders &amp; all, but it feels like a rich source of physical system metaphors. 

Including Buckminster Fuller &amp; "Call me Trim Tab"!

https://t.co/yfSupLVvtb

2019-08-23 at 22:31:05: @rfinz And floating or sailing are both different from the kind of flailing resistance/tension that's more like-

"WHAT THE FUCK is this boat metaphor I DID NOT sign up for this! Get me off this ride! Urrrgh, I feel seasick... Fuck you ocean, wind - you won't push me around!"

2019-08-23 at 22:28:02: @rfinz Other times, people can benefit from holding onto something, feeling the interplay of structure and experience, seeing where it takes them. 

Could mean holding a kind of meditative attention/awareness. Or an intention. 

There's tension in the sail, but not resisting the motion.

2019-08-23 at 22:21:05: @rfinz Folks are often confused by "letting go" and think, "So I should be... kind of floppy or passive?" 

That's one option, perhaps the "gentle float" strategy you mention. And sometimes there's no steering possible, nothing to do but dissolve and sort it out later.

2019-08-23 at 22:20:15: @rfinz Ooh, I like this! 

Goes well with a sailing metaphor I've used before, in contexts where people often suggest "letting go of resistance" to a difficult / emotional / deep / transformative experience.

More on "stigmergy," from Wikipedia on termites: https://t.co/RQyiDAslsX

2019-08-23 at 19:08:50: Ex: termites do this, by laying down pheromone trails, and also by making changes to their environment, that then prompt other termites to make further changes... so all the little actions lead to huge constructions like the massive cathedral-style termite mounds in Africa.

2019-08-23 at 19:08:49: "Stigmergy is a mechanism of indirect coordination, through the environment, between agents or actions. The principle is that the trace left in the environment by an action stimulates the performance of a next action, by the same or a different agent."

2019-08-21 at 05:23:02: And from the inside -- confound it, I understand the structure intellectually and it still bites me in the butt! 

Have been able to describe it for probably 5ish years, since reading about the Enneagram 5 pattern. 

And, I've become more able to *notice* when that's happening.

2019-08-21 at 05:23:02: Or like the shift from 2D Flatland to a 3D perspective.

2019-08-21 at 05:22:52: From a right/wrong mindset, this could be taken as a devastating put-down. 

From a collaborative mindset, it's a neutral description of a pattern that leads to suffering. A structural confusion about unworthiness, internalized, &amp; old survival mechanisms with predictable results.

2019-08-21 at 05:22:52: This next bit may need some context. It's from a mentor who I trust, both in terms of her thinking and her care for me. 

I also trust her commitments to post-jugdmental same-sidedness, to seeing people as learners, and to seeing the structural nature of "personal" patterns.

https://t.co/w7ZKKXxro9

which cites Girard as "the godfather of the 'like' button" because his theories prompted Peter Thiel to invest in Facebook in 2004. 

Would Girard have been horrified by that? Surely FB increases the frenzy of mimetic everything?

2019-08-19 at 17:20:37: Oh nooo... the article talks about Girard's take on the Garden of Eden and Revelations, and now I kind of want to write an elaborate analysis of Good Omens in terms of Girard vs. Schnarch on "differentiation"

2019-08-19 at 16:56:55: But are shell games with subsidiary companies and bankruptcies a form of corporate scapegoating and sacrifice? 

Drive all blame into one and run it into the ground, often escaping consequences (like coal mine cleanup beyond initial bonds, in frequent coal industry bankruptcies)

2019-08-19 at 16:56:55: Huh... lots about mimetic violence, blame, scapegoating, and human sacrifices. 

Alex Danco compares corporate culture (intense conflict over who will be CEO) versus startup culture (where no one can take the "founder" title, so they will at most split off a new company)...

2019-08-19 at 16:42:11: Re: "differentiation" - seems Girard uses that term differently from Schnarch, in "The Passionate Marriage"?

Girard refers to external differentiation in terms of rank or physical distance, while Schnarch points to an internal developmental move:

2019-08-19 at 16:38:50: Reading about "mimetic desire" - the idea that we don't primarily want to have specific objects, or to do things a certain way; 

we want to *be* a particular kind of person, and we attempt it by mimicry.

Now I have "Don't dream it, be it" from Rocky Horror stuck in my head...

2019-08-19 at 16:25:17: Huh! Fascinating read.

The 2nd one - I wouldn't want my notes / audio recs to disappear, so not sure how it ties back to Tiago's post

For a second, I was confused that small children needed a reminder not to bite their own teeth!

2019-08-12 at 20:50:09: @meditationstuff Huh! Learned a new word: "tokophobia", fear of pregnancy/childbirth. Reasonably accurate to apply that to myself.

Fewer monks to copy ‚û°Ô∏è higher cost for manuscripts ‚û°Ô∏è more incentives for printing, especially with cheaper rag paper.

2019-08-09 at 18:54:06: @tasshinfogleman @meditationstuff @LTF_01 @Sci_Hub @TAMU Maybe that's in relation to European monasteries in the Middle Ages producing illuminated manuscripts, and then the demand going down when the printing press was introduced?

2019-06-24 at 18:30:55: @reasonisfun Well... and physics equations are also context-sensitive to some extent. 

It's just that the "it depends" part is bundled off to the side in things like "range of applicability" or "under these conditions..."

For example, the speed of light is a constant... in a vacuum.

2019-06-24 at 18:24:01: @misen__ @context_ing I'm interested in the associations "post-judgement" brings up for you, Mi'sen, if you're willing to share? 

And/or any thoughts on alternative phrases. 

(We've been exploring a variety of other "post-" words, including post-blame, to point towards this area.)

2019-06-24 at 16:24:07: @reasonisfun Are you thinking of some universal principles in particular that you find valuable? (Very interested to hear them, if so!) 

Or more wanting to explore holding open the possibility of universals?

2019-06-24 at 16:22:28: @reasonisfun (Speaking personally here, not for the group)

Principles that span many contexts -- yes, that makes sense to me.  ("Generally" / "likely" etc)

Universally-applicable principles of what's good to do, without a single counter-example? I can't think of one offhand.

2019-06-24 at 05:46:20: @mattgoldenberg Oh dang it! Yeah, I forgot a part of that diagram, where the circles overlap! 

The overlap can either be a "muddle puddle" or a learning context, depending on whether there is scaffolding for navigating the transition intentionally.

2019-06-24 at 05:39:07: @mattgoldenberg So even in a "more beautiful world" future, it's important to keep the knowledge alive across generations, of the structure of the two systems, and the nature of the choice. 

It's like when people say, re: safety rules - "Your regulations are written in blood." https://t.co/2TVHbJUU8E

2019-06-24 at 05:31:53: @mattgoldenberg And, I think one way to look at coercive circle thinking is that it basically maps onto the sociopathic zero-trust power dynamics that emerge out of straight up game theory? 

Razor-wire math! Can't stamp it out, but can build over and around it. (Transcend &amp; include it?)

2019-06-24 at 05:27:39: @mattgoldenberg Taboos can be exciting ("Surely, the sexy unknown would be better!), but banal dysfunction is boring. 

Like, given the option, it's easy to choose whether to drive with a flat tire or an inflated one.

2019-06-24 at 05:27:10: @mattgoldenberg Keeping the awareness of "red" circle thinking alive is kind of like an inoculation against naivety. 

Provides lived experience that informs non-naive choice of collaborative patterns. (Maybe even a rite of passage?) Developing that self-authored self trust is crucial.

2019-06-24 at 05:17:18: @mattgoldenberg To the best of my understanding, the idea is that trying to achieve a totally "blue" circle -- trying to eliminate coercive patterns entirely -- wouldn't work. 

Because its stability would then depend on the suppression of information about patterns that emerge out of... math?

2019-06-24 at 05:14:10: @mattgoldenberg (I'm drawing this from memory, in reference to a model held by this community - so I may need to come back later and refine my presentation of it)

2019-06-24 at 05:12:59: @mattgoldenberg I drew a sketch to help talk about stuff! 

Here, the coercive / dualistic / blame-based circle is in red, 

and the collaborative / post-judgemental / post-blame circle is in blue: https://t.co/hwQQpD8uV5

2019-06-24 at 05:10:52: @mattgoldenberg Ah! Important questions, and I'm wanting to be clear on what you're pointing at.

Is it, "Why is the dualistic coercive circle being held by the post-judgemental collaborative circle, instead of the desired state being entirely cooperative?"

2019-06-24 at 04:44:57: @mattgoldenberg Oh dangit -- I made a whole giant thread in response and forgot to link it here in this one!

https://t.co/HliaB1JsKH

2019-06-24 at 04:21:19: @coponder @mattgoldenberg And there's definitely a need to develop both capacities as well as the ability to switch between them as the situation requires. 

(Subjective / objective; feeling / thinking; psychological distance vs embodiment, etc.)

2019-06-24 at 04:20:10: @coponder @mattgoldenberg The idea is that the "mountain lion" refers to the experience of merging with the situation at hand and being in the moment, while the "ecologist" refers to the experience of separating or distancing yourself from it, to be able to analyze the situation.

2019-06-24 at 04:18:43: @coponder @mattgoldenberg Another example: the "ecologist and the mountain lion," from Gregory Bateson in Steps to an Ecology of Mind.

The original quote is, "Surely the mountain lion when he kills the deer is not acting to protect the grass from overgrazing."

2019-06-24 at 04:16:43: @coponder @mattgoldenberg Oh, definitely! You need both, in order to dance with systems.

2019-06-24 at 04:10:38: A branch off of the previous thread, with a discussion of Lagrange points, navigating through the liminal space between paradigms, and rebooting motivation systems: https://t.co/H355OfG3Ou

2019-06-24 at 04:08:44: @mattgoldenberg As Matt mentioned, "learning to play with embodied viewpoints" seems to be key to rebuilding new navigation &amp; motivation systems. 

Also re-developing a felt sense of what you deeply want, and building the self-trust to act into that. 

That's right at my current learning edge.

2019-06-24 at 04:01:30: @mattgoldenberg So, here's a short excerpt from the transcript of a conversation from this learning community, about navigating the liminal space between paradigms:

https://t.co/eh0f0H6Spk

2019-06-24 at 03:56:12: @mattgoldenberg Some people rush through the discomfort of liminality, and when they snap back to a "safe" settled mindset, they try to forget the experience of disorientation.

But it seems that a core part of the work is learning to be with that unusual sensation, until it becomes navigable.

2019-06-24 at 03:54:08: @mattgoldenberg We started talking about "liminal space" and the disorientation - even nausea - that people can experience in the transition between maps and mindsets.

2019-06-24 at 03:52:50: @mattgoldenberg And how does all these navigational metaphors tie in with mindsets and motivation?

I'm finding that I want to share a short excerpt from a conversation that happened in the learning community I'm part of, from Dec 2018.

2019-06-24 at 03:51:18: @mattgoldenberg But if you still have a bit of momentum, or if a friend lassoed you, or if you found one last puff of fuel...  you could start moving towards the moon again, and eventually you'd start being pulled "down" into its gravity well.

2019-06-24 at 03:50:56: @mattgoldenberg If you stopped yourself there, canceled out your momentum, and ran out of fuel, you'd just drift there forever. 

üåé&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;------------------------üò®üöÄ----&gt;&gt;üåñ

2019-06-24 at 03:47:18: @mattgoldenberg This is, again, a different "up" than "north", and if you're trying to use that old map, you will be confused.

And (if you're an astronaut) you can go so far "up" towards the moon that you pass through this oddly liminal space, the L1 point of effectively zero gravity.

2019-06-24 at 03:47:05: @mattgoldenberg And, ok -- this is a toy model, and we've sorted it out so that pilots don't actually get confused about this when navigating around the globe. 

...But what about when you go "up" in altitude?

2019-06-24 at 03:46:37: @mattgoldenberg But if you go "up" to the North Pole, suddenly -- your compass doesn't work the same! "Up" doesn't make sense! 

You might think you need to "keep going up" (north) to fly from Canada to Siberia, but -- suddenly you're going "down" (south) without changing course??

2019-06-24 at 03:46:19: @mattgoldenberg Most places on Earth, you can use a compass, go north / south / east / west, and get where you want to go. 

And people often use "up" as shorthand for "north", and "down" for "south," and it's easy to understand.

2019-06-24 at 03:45:57: @mattgoldenberg Mhm! One metaphor I've played with involves exploring motivation systems by looking at navigation systems.

2019-06-23 at 23:02:55: @FateOfTwist_ @Malcolm_Ocean @fortelabs @garybasin And a related thread that brings up (among many other subjects) a podcast where Culadasa talks about the difference between meditative practices involving "attention" (left hemisphere?) and "awareness" (right hemisphere?):

https://t.co/vSZPUzolHb

2019-06-23 at 22:58:11: @FateOfTwist_ @Malcolm_Ocean @fortelabs @garybasin Ooh! I'm reminded of a thread I wrote about the way the shape of a handle affects how you use a tool. 

I was trying to offer a tactile metaphor into a conversation people were having about Sutric &amp; Consensus Buddhism:

https://t.co/CbmHwNDSxm

2019-06-23 at 22:50:20: The rest of the picture shows the post-judgmental mindset encompassing the dualistic. 

There is a living, verdant, tree-like limb, and a wintry, skeletal limb, representing the "both/and" awareness of the building up and breaking down of life, meaning, knowing, etc.

17/

2019-06-23 at 22:50:19: The center of the picture shows the coercive, dualistic mindset, with an "asshole angel" on a cloud and a self-flagellating devil in flames. 

Other figures are falling into hell, and trying to claw their way into heaven, showing the precarious nature of moralistic judgment.

16/

2019-06-23 at 22:50:19: These collaborative and coercive ways of understanding the world are also represented in this drawing:

15/ https://t.co/42XZLmv360

2019-06-23 at 22:50:16: In the learning community I'm part of, we talk about "collaborative circle" and "coercive circle" cultural platforms:

https://t.co/2Bnl6HKaGK

14/

2019-06-23 at 22:21:30: The book "Synergetics" describes this as a choice between "synergic" and "dysergic" ways of being. 

NVC folks talk about "contributing to the wonderfulness of life" vs "tragic expressions of unmet needs".

Buddhists point to "sukha" vs "dukkha":

https://t.co/L40zyeFw2k

13/

2019-06-23 at 22:21:29: And... in the midst of stepping into and out of different paradigms, different stories that generate various experiences of attraction and revulsion, there is another kind of choice to make. 

12/

2019-06-23 at 22:21:29: I wrote a thread about the "both/and" nature of "charnel ground" and "pure land" views, with examples that might flip that visceral sense of attraction or revulsion back and forth:

https://t.co/QD753PW1AI

11/

2019-06-23 at 22:21:29: Not taking individual subjectivity as the whole thing or the only thing that generates meaning -- that'd be existentialism, which would lead to confusion again.

And yet embodied experience is a key part.

10/

2019-06-23 at 22:21:28: Post-judgement is also different from vague, abstracted, or dissociated non-judgement.

I think this is what Matt was pointing at in his initial tweet? There's a need to step into your subjective experience as part of the whole sense-making system. 

9/

2019-06-23 at 22:21:28: This post-judgement is different from universalizing or dualistic judgements (is this always right or wrong, good or bad?). 

Focuses instead on context - to what extent is this well-suited / useful / in alignment / in integrity, in relation to a particular purpose? 

8/

2019-06-23 at 22:21:28: I wouldn't personally call the resulting state "superpowered judgement"... perhaps, smoothly powerful context-sensitive discernment? 

7/

2019-06-23 at 22:21:28: Several friends have experienced it. I've had some periods of that and wouldn't be surprised if I encountered more layers in the future.

6/

2019-06-23 at 22:21:27: Re: that zero gravity point - if your motivation and navigation has been based on systems of (external and internalized) coercion, I think it's likely to experience a breakdown of motivation (lasting days or weeks or more) in the process of rebuilding on a new platform. 

5/

2019-06-23 at 22:21:27: And there may well be a "zero gravity" point in the Kegan 4-5 transition, like the L1 point between the Earth &amp; moon, where you've uninstalled all previous systems of judgement, but don't yet have a new way to orient towards desirable / undesirable states with more fluidity. 

4/

2019-06-23 at 22:21:27: E.g., you could wind up in new age eternalistic vagueness -- all viewpoints are relative, they're all right in some way, and that's okay. 

Or postmodern nihilistic abstraction -- all viewpoints are relative, there's no comfortable solid truth anywhere, and that's terrible. 

3/

2019-06-23 at 22:21:26: Matt, does this match your sense?

Within a paradigm, there's a clear sense of what is good and bad, right and wrong. 

Partial attempts to transcend paradigms &amp; judgement can fall into muddled, quasi-neutral states that provide no help at all in practical navigation. 

2/

2019-06-23 at 22:21:26: Let's see... I think it'll be easier to make this into a thread. 

For context, Matt wrote: "Kegan 5 isn't letting go of judgement, its' superpowered judgement." 

I'm wanting to explore that more, especially what we mean by "judgement".

1/ https://t.co/Fkk5OndMNi

2019-06-23 at 17:01:24: @mattgoldenberg Seems to me that the word "judgement" is carrying a lot of weight there. 

I can imagine either feeling resonance or dissonance with what you've written, depending on how you're holding "judgement". 

Would you be willing to write another version that taboos the word "judgement"?

2019-05-09 at 20:17:46: @Malcolm_Ocean @kevinakwok @KevinSimler @backus @nayafia @JoHenrich I can draw faces decently well when looking at people or photos, but from memory it winds up as minimalist cartoons with accurate hair length / glasses / etc, but not very recognizable.

2019-05-09 at 20:14:39: @Malcolm_Ocean @kevinakwok @KevinSimler @backus @nayafia @JoHenrich I read *very* fast - learning about that tradeoff was an "aha!" moment. 

I'm certainly not as faceblind as Oliver Sacks was. Seems I have a right hemisphere gestalt, and some fragments of left hemisphere specific focus, but LH can't quite synthesize the parts into a whole?

2019-05-09 at 20:09:18: @Malcolm_Ocean @kevinakwok @KevinSimler @backus @nayafia @JoHenrich Here are some excerpts from The Secret of Our Success, on reading &amp; facial recognition: https://t.co/KIhRG8Hj4A

2019-05-09 at 20:08:23: @Malcolm_Ocean @kevinakwok @KevinSimler @backus @nayafia I read something in @JoHenrich 's The Secret of Our Success that might shed some light on what's up. 

Learning to read competes with facial recognition, for space in the fusiform gyrus. Pushes face recognition out of the left side, and into the right hemisphere as best it can

2019-05-09 at 20:04:47: @Malcolm_Ocean @kevinakwok @KevinSimler @backus @nayafia Awww hi! ‚ô•Ô∏è

About tactile mapping... I think it's not just about the sensory modality.

For familiar faces, I do have a gestalt sense of each individual face as a whole. It's visual / emotional, and probably other senses if I have that experience.

2019-05-09 at 14:33:15: @Malcolm_Ocean @kevinakwok @KevinSimler @backus @nayafia Faces, though! They resist both vector and raster recall. I remember parts of faces but can't get them to cohere into an entire accurate picture in memory.

...Probably moderately faceblind.

2019-05-09 at 14:23:47: @Malcolm_Ocean @kevinakwok @KevinSimler @backus @nayafia Although - hmm, I can do the wireframe too - just from a different prompt than "what does it look like from outside".

Uhh... I think it still usually has color but it's like vector art. Oh! Yeah, your prompt led to a raster, no wonder.

2: As a vector that points at a competing desire, under which is some universal human need )

2019-04-24 at 17:21:46: @reasonisfun @pnw_anglo @cosimia_ @JayTSack I agree that peer group emotional &amp; opinion tracking is straightforwardly valuable. 

I'm claiming that clickbait is a parasitic meme piggybacking on that otherwise adaptive system.

(Like -- blood carries nutrients; mosquitos feed on blood)

2019-04-24 at 17:17:52: (the 'recursive trap' being -- trying not to generate clickbait in the process of deconstructing it and investigating remedies to it!)

(Haha -- to try &amp; avoid recursive trap: 
evolutionary and memetic perspectives, 
toxoplasma of rage, 
ad revenue as internet's "original sin", 
deep emotional work as individual agency in navigating "procrastination") https://t.co/rL43aZn94q

https://t.co/Rp8xccqojO

2019-04-24 at 17:10:58: @pnw_anglo @reasonisfun @cosimia_ @JayTSack And, of course, there is a lot that individuals can do to work with their personal relation to using time and attention in ways that don't feel aligned with deep purpose! 

Recognizing when it happens is a key first step. Also feeling into why it's happening.

2019-04-24 at 17:09:42: @pnw_anglo @reasonisfun @cosimia_ @JayTSack I don't know how to replace it. Folks are trying various things, with micropayment and subscription systems.

But I do think this is the level on which we need to be thinking about problems with clickbait and attention parasites, if we're looking at culture-scale interventions.

2019-04-24 at 17:07:30: @pnw_anglo @reasonisfun @cosimia_ @JayTSack I think that many forms of "regulation" would be a confused response to this, if they tried to treat the surface without addressing the core. 

This article describes a core issue, of ad-based revenue as the internet's "original sin":

https://t.co/Jm9d0ASmlI

2019-04-24 at 16:56:52: @pnw_anglo @reasonisfun @cosimia_ @JayTSack To the extent that clickbait ties into that system, it makes sense that it would spread. 

And, yes, parasitically in the sense that it's not good for us in its current form.

One model of that form is the "toxoplasma of rage":

https://t.co/btxkbYTFwI

2019-04-24 at 16:54:27: @pnw_anglo @reasonisfun @cosimia_ @JayTSack Perhaps not "distractibility"?

Instead, consider the very adaptive trait of, "What are my peers thinking and feeling right now?"

2019-04-24 at 13:42:51: All of my examples were pointing at an "emotional sensing / sense-making" type of dimension.

2019-04-24 at 13:25:53: @jonnym1ller @Malcolm_Ocean If taken w/o a context for making sense of experiences &amp; re-integrating with daily life, practice, and meaning --psychedelics can certainly sometimes lead folks towards unfounded beliefs. 

Random reinforcement, like Skinner's 'superstitious' pigeons:

Sails require skillfully adjusted tension, so the wind can push against them and transform its force into the movement of the ship.

(there's other kinds of resistance too, but those rhymed!)

2019-04-23 at 23:45:49: @webdevMason @KevinSimler In later life, these "calluses" reduce sensitivity to listening, even in situations where the person might actually deeply want and need to take in what's being said.  

The "tuning out" path is worn deep, and easy to fall into.

2019-04-23 at 23:45:35: @webdevMason @KevinSimler I've described one aspect of this as "calluses against listening." 

Kids are forced to sit quietly and stare forward, regardless of whether or not they are interested or understanding what's being said. Repeat for years, and "calluses" develop.

2019-04-23 at 04:44:14: @QiaochuYuan More and more people start showing up with the same symptoms (and others). 

At some point, surely it becomes clear that it's a systemic issue, rather than a bunch of people with personal problems?

2019-04-22 at 21:40:53: @s_r_constantin @reasonisfun @Meaningness And I bet there's some layer of, 'I find it really hard to think about what it would mean if I enjoyed this thing when I was young, and I'm now standing here telling my kid not to do it."

2019-04-22 at 21:39:28: @s_r_constantin @reasonisfun @Meaningness It's hard to get at that level, because of a lot of unconscious layers of defense. 

People might have patterns of downplaying how fun the thing was when they were kids, or coming up with any number of confabulations / justifications.

2019-04-22 at 21:33:22: @s_r_constantin @reasonisfun @Meaningness Could be because "That's not how we do things" or "It's against the rules" -- but maybe underneath there's:

'I start to feel panicky and queasy about that line of questioning, which might flash to anger in a split second because I don't like feeling panicky.'

2019-04-22 at 21:30:50: @s_r_constantin @reasonisfun @Meaningness So: why would adults forbid kids from doing fun things, like mudpies, wearing sparkle capes to official buildings, or expressing uninhibited vulnerable creativity?

(Or why might peers punish each other for similar things?)

2019-04-22 at 21:22:37: @s_r_constantin @reasonisfun The discomfort = fear of destabilizing personal identity, and also your fundamental meaning-making structures - how you make sense of the world &amp; yourself. 

Destabilizing that can often produce existential panic, nihilism. 

(See what @meaningness has written, for example)

2019-04-22 at 21:21:32: @s_r_constantin @reasonisfun For punishment, it's like a game of generational hot potato -- very hard to be the one to do the self-reflection, face the (sometimes extreme) discomfort of cognitive dissonance, and say... "Wait, why *did* I do that? Is that what I actually want to do?"

2019-04-22 at 21:20:25: @s_r_constantin @reasonisfun One interpretation:

A: Why the hell did I do that? Uhh... must've been that it *was* actually exciting, bc I'm not the kind of person who likes boring things!

B: Why? For the money, duh. 

(This was 1959, so $20 adjusted for inflation is ~$175)

2019-04-22 at 21:17:38: @s_r_constantin @reasonisfun So this experiment -- people did a super long boring task, &amp; were then asked to pitch it as exciting to new "participants":

Group A got $1; group B got $20. 

Afterwards, A rated task way more exciting than B did.

Why?

2019-04-22 at 21:16:55: @s_r_constantin @reasonisfun Oh dang... what if it's aversion to cognitive dissonance on a personal level, coupled with larger forces driving static memeplexes on a cultural level?

And she describes ways this dynamic can be rehabbed into a collaborative internal relationship.

2019-04-21 at 14:10:15: @Malcolm_Ocean @KarliePonett This convo is reminding me of what Sarah Peyton talks about in her book, Your Resonant Self.

2019-04-21 at 14:02:55: @xuenay @_awbery_ @SupernormalMind @drossbucket The fact that tasks disappear when completed seems a total afterthought, a minor mechanic to avoid cluttering your space.

The aesthetics slope towards more action, rather than more stillness.

2019-04-21 at 14:01:02: @xuenay @_awbery_ @SupernormalMind @drossbucket Habitica, on the other hand, is a whole pageantry! Equip your avatar, get points for checking things off, fight monsters with friends! Turns your to-do list into an role-playing game. https://t.co/DrwC4e4VhD

2019-04-21 at 14:00:04: @xuenay @_awbery_ @SupernormalMind @drossbucket After meeting Malcolm, I now store notes there, and feel a tiny bit of aesthetic "guilt" / dissonance! 

But it's a very fine tool for notes. It's just that there's this baked-in landscape that slopes towards emptiness.

2019-04-21 at 13:59:13: @xuenay @_awbery_ @SupernormalMind @drossbucket Workflowy has a very minimalist white &amp; black interface, and tasks disappear when completed. 

When I started using it, I had a vague sense of... wouldn't it be nicer if I completed everything and got it back to that clean slate? Isn't it a bit messy to add a new thing?

2019-04-21 at 13:58:41: @xuenay @_awbery_ @SupernormalMind @drossbucket Metaphor #2: Workflowy &amp; Habitica. 

They're both ways of collecting &amp; completing tasks. And they have many differences in design (both obvious &amp; subtle, fundamental &amp; superficial).

These shape the landscape of which interactions seem more easy / natural / "downhill."

2019-04-21 at 13:39:25: @xuenay @_awbery_ @SupernormalMind @drossbucket Maybe then Tantra is more like... you're grabbing the handle of the knife, and while you can sharpen it on a whetstone, cut up a watermelon, gut a fish (etc), you're not going to lose track of the blade and accidentally file it down to nothing. 

Although, you might cut yourself!

2019-04-21 at 13:37:51: @xuenay @_awbery_ @SupernormalMind @drossbucket With a rounded handle, you can't lay it flat and move the knife across; you have to hold the file and move it. 

When filing real knives, people advise caution, because there's a tendency to remove too much: https://t.co/nvC1NFE70o

2019-04-21 at 13:36:50: @xuenay @_awbery_ @SupernormalMind @drossbucket The new Consensus Buddhism packaging just says, "Great for sharpening!" The shape of the handle is unchanged.

If you want to sharpen the knife of your awareness, you can use a file for that. But the handle shapes the way you use it. 
https://t.co/BIoKYYrCnN

2019-04-21 at 13:36:12: @xuenay @_awbery_ @SupernormalMind @drossbucket I'm going to see if a metaphor helps here. I can think of 2. 

1: I'm imagining Sutric meditation practices as like a file or rasp. It's a tool for removing. The traditional framework says its purpose is to remove everything.

2019-04-21 at 13:13:34: @xuenay @_awbery_ @SupernormalMind @drossbucket (Cognitive coupling is my native language, and I have... proficiency in decoupling, but it's broken down a few times in classes on organic chem, physics, parts of calculus, programming. I can often intuit the shapes, but get frustrated with the notation &amp; teaching style.)

2019-04-21 at 13:03:45: @xuenay @_awbery_ @SupernormalMind @drossbucket Another interpretation could be: no matter how much you lean towards decoupling, the nature of contemplative practice will take you places where context matters, so at some point it won't be possible to fully separate tool from context &amp; framework.

2019-04-21 at 13:00:34: @xuenay @_awbery_ @SupernormalMind @drossbucket And, it could apply in different ways. 

One way could be: individuals fall on a spectrum of strong cognitive coupling &lt;--&gt; strong cognitive decoupling. The farther towards coupling you are, the more the context &amp; framework of the practice are inseparable from the tools.

2019-04-21 at 12:57:03: @xuenay @_awbery_ @SupernormalMind Hmm... reading this discussion, I'm reminded of @drossbucket 's post on cognitive decoupling. I'm wondering, is that concept useful in pointing at a difference in assumptions or experience y'all might be having?

2019-04-19 at 19:14:16: @Meaningness @Malcolm_Ocean @_awbery_ The shape in my head is something like... 

Sutra: Every time you get to a dharma gate, go through it. They're boundless. (Etc) 

Dzogchen: Just look at the thing! The sum of the infinite series converges to Buddhahood. Feel that click into place, and then go do stuff with it!

?

2019-04-19 at 19:10:39: @Meaningness @Malcolm_Ocean @_awbery_ Hmm... just thought of that metaphor, and it may not hold up.

In calculus, my eyes always glazed over when they got to series. So, this feels very fuzzy. 

I'm thinking of this version of the vows (image): https://t.co/sPsFgfoBOt

2019-04-19 at 18:58:01: @Meaningness @Malcolm_Ocean @_awbery_ Also, I have no idea how y'all think of Alan Watts! 

I feel very fortunate to have downloaded like 3 gigs of his stuff in 2010 - provided an extremely useful memetic vaccine against nihilism &amp; more virulent philosophies. 

But maybe he leans monist / eternalist / muddled?

2019-04-19 at 18:55:36: @Meaningness @Malcolm_Ocean @_awbery_ I guess I've maybe thought of the vows as like the parts of calculus where the dang sigmas come in, and sometimes it's a complicated-looking thing that adds up to 1. So you could go iterate stepwise through it, or get how it comes out?

2019-04-19 at 18:52:55: @Meaningness @Malcolm_Ocean @_awbery_ Huh! Ok, so... is that why Bodhisattva "vows" don't quite make sense in tantra?

Because instead of saying, "I vow to keep trying for the impossible" it's like... get on with it?

(I'm reminded of Alan Watts saying, "Oh, come off it, Shiva!")

2019-04-19 at 17:34:23: @_Piperfog @KarliePonett An interesting thing here - are difference &amp; hierarchy always "bad", or is there a place for voluntary, temporary, project-based hierarchy in a collaborative framework?

Ex: Jane knows how to build a barn. Ed wants a barn. Jane leads neighborhood barn-raising.

2019-04-19 at 17:28:44: @_jordan_bates Reminds me of Leonard Cohen's song Anthem:

"Ring the bells (ring the bells) that still can ring
Forget your perfect offering
There is a crack in everything (there is a crack in everything)
That's how the light gets in"

2019-04-19 at 16:53:01: @_Piperfog @KarliePonett And, it's usually not just one choice, but over and over until it sticks.

I do think there's a role for learning, teaching, growing together. And learning is not a thing you can "do to" another person. 

Very counterproductive to try &amp; force through internal resistance.

2019-04-19 at 16:48:51: @_Piperfog @KarliePonett One way I've made sense of my experience, is that there's an internal choice towards... accepting what is so, as a starting point for healing. 
The opposite of denial, reflexively flinching away from pain.

And nobody can make that choice for another person. Not possible.

2019-04-19 at 16:09:45: Ah dangit, I probably *do* need to write up a blog post on this. Seems like I can't not do it.

2019-04-19 at 16:09:44: And my framework doesn't negate respect and caution! 
Holy crap, be careful with these things!

This is tinkering with the foundations of your own goddamn mental &amp; cultural software: concepts of identity, motivational drives, sense of meaning, etc..

2019-04-19 at 16:09:44: Memeplexes reproduce themselves like genes, but much faster in our current cultural environment. 

Some are more or less friendly to human wellbeing and what we care about. Some are parasitic, others symbiotic, or inspirational.
Some are huge &amp; cultural, others small &amp; personal.

2019-04-19 at 16:09:44: My take also provides a way to understand observed ~agency of psychedelic entities. 

"What does ayahuasca want?"
Same type of question as, "What does capitalism want?"
Or Buddhism, Santa Claus, etc.

All can be understood to cause tangible material change via human action.

2019-04-19 at 16:09:43: Hrmm... this seems slightly less confused than some accounts, but still confused! 

My take: "Ayahuasca spirits" as hyperobjects, distributed computing memeplexes - doesn't require dualism, doesn't negate profundity &amp; utility of experiences. https://t.co/EaHWZRiuGC

2019-04-19 at 15:41:16: @KarliePonett @_Piperfog The book Conscious Loving has models of what people can do instead of victimhood, towards integration and growth:

https://t.co/1M1Yv7CWDz

2019-04-19 at 15:40:48: @KarliePonett @_Piperfog And, hmm... I think that "victimhood" as a concept is broken. 

Our culture has set it up so that only victims deserve support. ("Deserve" is also broken!) 

But this creates a scarcity of caring, and can cut people off from their own power and agency to learn and grow.

2019-04-19 at 15:28:49: @KarliePonett @_Piperfog (This is one of David Chapman's sites, btw)

2019-04-19 at 15:20:46: @KarliePonett @_Piperfog Huh, this sounds like a very different understanding of "darkness" and "victimhood", than what I use. 

I've been reading a lot about Buddhist Tantra lately. They model darkness/horror as an inescapable fact of life, &amp; powerful tool when integrated:

2019-04-19 at 03:06:17: @JMartinMcFly Hey @Malcolm_Ocean - sounds like some of the functions you've been wanting?

2019-04-19 at 02:25:06: @BenGoldhaber @QiaochuYuan I think there are a lot that care about *their* humans, but... so far, it's very hard to scale that caring up to *all* humans (and the ecological etc systems of which we are a part). 

So a lot of that loving in-group care becomes hateful or indifferent out-group externality

2019-04-19 at 02:21:32: @spearofsolomon @QiaochuYuan Yup. Reminds me of this article:

2019-04-19 at 01:56:32: @_awbery_ @Meaningness I've also been unsure how to talk about bodhisattva motivation / vows. 

I feel clear in myself about it, as best I can, and unclear about cultural contexts and vocabulary. 

Especially because different traditions have different practices.

2019-04-19 at 01:51:03: @_awbery_ @Meaningness Feels... solid, to hear all this. I hadn't really realized how confusing it's been, to try and "do" cobbled-together Buddhism fragments. 

(And glad I didn't try to commit to a formal Sutra path!)

2019-04-19 at 01:03:28: @Meaningness @Malcolm_Ocean Ahahaha oh nooo! I got increasingly distressed at how polyphyletic, multisyllabic, and confusing Buddhist classification schemes are -- and then started laughing, because I'd just written a whole long thing about how you can't escape distressing things!

2019-04-19 at 00:55:05: @Auptimist Interesting!

2019-04-18 at 23:50:11: And you can still make choices that matter, to care for what you care about.

2019-04-18 at 23:50:11: Contaminated and pure, sacred and profane start to break down, and build back up into something different.

I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a ‚Äúright‚Äù or ‚Äúwrong‚Äù way to feel about these, before or after you know more about them. Many layers of meaning and story. It‚Äôs patterned and nebulous.

2019-04-18 at 23:43:21: (((If you really, really, really want an extra-strength bonus mediation on grotesque Darwinian patterns juxtaposed with tenderness and meaning --

2019-04-18 at 23:40:26: Does it look any different now? https://t.co/BsrBqg4lPe

2019-04-18 at 23:40:26: Welp: https://t.co/10SI3Md4Wc 

Some of the key patterns that make you who you are, biologically, are made of ancient viruses. We wouldn‚Äôt be able to carry our babies in the womb, if it weren‚Äôt for viral DNA.

2019-04-18 at 23:40:25: And, the retrovirus. What comes up for you?

As humans, we're not on Team Virus, right? Viruses are terrifying, and sometimes deadly! https://t.co/OdjJHTQDfr

2019-04-18 at 23:35:11: And! Humans have worshipped scarabs, dung beetles. 

Without them, we‚Äôd be knee-deep in dung! 
Important for nutrient cycling.
https://t.co/tiULh5908f

2019-04-18 at 23:35:11: Dung beetle poets: 

"Shit, triumphant prize of victors! Shit, nourishing cradle for babies! 

The ox anus, glorious fountain from which all good things flow!"

2019-04-18 at 23:35:11: Consider that different species would have different valences (attraction / aversion) to the same stimuli. 

If dung beetles wrote poetry, they would compose odes to the sweet fragrance of life-giving shit.

2019-04-18 at 23:35:10: It‚Äôs also a dung beetle! Does that change how you feel?

(Phanaeus vindex - I‚Äôve seen ‚Äòem in Florida!) https://t.co/o0WF6w9Yo8

2019-04-18 at 23:35:10: And the beetle! I find it beautiful!

How about you? https://t.co/5O1UuAIDn3

2019-04-18 at 23:29:54: What emotion is there now? Is the photo still ugly? https://t.co/6OD5goySj7

2019-04-18 at 23:29:54: (Couldn‚Äôt find #s for parasitoids specifically, but biological control provides half the value of food production!

Cock et al. 2012 - PDF via Google Scholar, search doi 10.1079/PAVSNNR20127043 ) https://t.co/EtYfnhQEQa

2019-04-18 at 23:29:54: And yet. Without parasitoid wasps, and other diseases and predators that kill plant-eating insects, our own vital crops would fail. 

If baculoviruses did not liquefy caterpillars, human children would starve.

2019-04-18 at 23:29:53: (Darwin felt the horror: "I cannot persuade myself that a beneficent and omnipotent God would have designedly created parasitic wasps with the express intention of their feeding within the living bodies of Caterpillars.")

2019-04-18 at 23:29:53: As a child, I felt the horror, and would try to remove the cocoons, not knowing it was already doomed.

2019-04-18 at 23:29:53: Or, perhaps, you find a caterpillar, covered in cocoons of parasitoid wasps. The larvae have eaten it from the inside out, and emerged through its skin. It will die soon. 

What does that bring up? https://t.co/6hmaYoSx0w

2019-04-18 at 23:25:47: Now you find out it is Striga, witchweed, a parasitic plant that sucks nutrients from cereal crops. It destroys the equivalent of 15 million meals per day in Africa.

You might feel horror, sadness, anger, resolve? 

Is it still beautiful? https://t.co/SgBhgfoIXM

2019-04-18 at 23:25:47: Let‚Äôs start with the flower. Maybe you find it beautiful, and you‚Äôre pleased? https://t.co/qT4EYSY49c

2019-04-18 at 23:21:52: Ok, so!

- A pink flower
-  A green caterpillar covered in small white things
- An iridescent beetle
- A retrovirus (diagram)

Any particular reactions so far, right off the bat? https://t.co/3JD7vWxMCj

2019-04-18 at 23:21:52: Now, I want to pull in a few examples from biology &amp; ecology, to point at how all this goes way deeper than any modern Moloch.

(Perhaps a bit of bending some assumption back and forth until it snaps?)

2019-04-18 at 23:21:52: And there‚Äôs something here about‚Ä¶ ‚Äúhorror that paralyzes‚Äù (like Lovecraftian nihilism) vs ‚Äúhorror that galvanizes‚Äù (like Feynman at the Oak Ridge plant, telling folks to store those nuclear materials further apart!)

2019-04-18 at 23:21:52: Or, folks could add ‚Äúbut it‚Äôs hopeless‚Äù to #3 and fall into a trap of:

4B: Moloch is Evil and no other things are Good. 

There‚Äôs nihilism for you:
https://t.co/V7H1taFUd7

2019-04-18 at 23:21:52: (This, I think, is why Scott Alexander‚Äôs post about ‚ÄúThe Goddess of Everything Else‚Äù didn‚Äôt quite land for me? Because it‚Äôs about getting entirely free of the Darwinian charnel ground, and I think that‚Äôs a confusion.)

2019-04-18 at 23:21:51: Now, here‚Äôs where things could get confused, if folks went on to:

4A: Moloch is Evil and some other things are Good; Moloch is entirely contaminated and some other things are pure. 

There‚Äôs dualism for you! And a whole bunch of stuff around attachment and aversion.

2019-04-18 at 23:21:51: If someone‚Äôs very reactive, getting some space between the gut reaction, and the meaning of it, and the choice of action, can help. 

If someone‚Äôs very numb, getting more connection with the gut reaction, and the meaning of it, and the choice of action, can help.

2019-04-18 at 23:21:51: And we‚Äôve had cultures clash and break down such that an action can mean ‚Äúloving care‚Äù in one framework and ‚Äúhorror like unto misplaced bodily fluids‚Äù in another. Crazy-making!

2019-04-18 at 23:21:51: And also, the value of a signal is dependent on its context. 
We‚Äôre now in a situation where there is no ‚Äúaway.‚Äù Reflexive flinching is no longer enough.

2019-04-18 at 23:21:50: Flinching from horror has been adaptive for human survival! 

Flinch away from misplaced blood and shit ‚Üí get fewer infections ‚Üí have more surviving babies. 

I figure, treat it as a signal, as you would pain - "alert! this situation is not friendly to human survival"

2019-04-18 at 23:21:50: Some things that make decent sense to me:

1. Molochian patterns freak me the fuck out, man! I am frightened, I am horrified. 
2. Molochian patterns could kill me, and could destroy human civilization as we know it.
3. I want to live and thrive, and I want the same for humanity.

2019-04-18 at 23:21:50: I think there are at least a few different components of how someone could react to ‚ÄúChildren of Moloch‚Äù memeplexes, and folks could get tangled up between them. 

(I may bungle this and would be glad of any help; words remain broken as usual)

2019-04-18 at 23:21:50: I also find myself wanting to point at some of @algekalipso ‚Äòs stuff:
https://t.co/4gHPe0EFyV

I don‚Äôt always agree with his conclusions, and I find his work fascinating. There‚Äôs usually a chunk of math and physics leading up to the conclusion that I haven‚Äôt yet managed to grok.

2019-04-18 at 23:21:49: And I think that Tantra perspective is an important base for any practice that involves looking at horror. 

(Vinay Gupta talks about this in his recent conversations with Daniel Thorson, which is a Whole ‚ÄòNother Thread)

2019-04-18 at 23:12:12: And as a pure land:
https://t.co/7YWbSrxMQK

2019-04-18 at 23:12:12: So, horror: not just modern, not just egregores! 

(And egregores: not just horror! Could write another thread on friendly ones, little household gods, etc.) 

Probably handy to start off with these posts about seeing the world as a charnel ground:

2019-04-18 at 23:12:11: I've been thinking a lot about this today, and now it's gotten all mixed up with a bunch of reading I was doing about Vajrayana and Tantra. 

I guess that's pretty appropriate!

2019-04-18 at 23:12:11: Ok, I'm going to attempt a really long thread in response to this... https://t.co/uC7xox1VhO

2019-04-18 at 22:55:24: @QiaochuYuan Oh man. I've been thinking a lot about this today, and now it's gotten all mixed up with a bunch of reading I was doing about Vajrayana and Tantra, and I guess that's pretty appropriate! I've got a whole bunch of stuff written, trying to decide whether to post it as tweets...

2019-04-18 at 19:34:31: Buddhist ideas have been pretty core to how I understand myself and the world, and also I've had no formal nothin'. 

How do Vajrayana / Tantra teachings interact with the Bodhisattva vows, for instance?

2019-04-18 at 19:34:31: Oh man, what a fantastic muddle! I seem to be solidly inclined towards the Tantra side of this? 

Certainly the cessation of sensation, focus on no-self as goal, renunciate practice, and the arhat path haven't appealed to me.

2019-04-18 at 12:28:12: An extensive convo in this thread about Sutric &amp; Tantric practices (click 6/6 post if it's not visible).

2019-04-18 at 05:42:59: @alifeofmovement The field of international negotiation has some useful resources, like Adam Kahane's book "Collaborating with the Enemy: How to Work with People You Don‚Äôt Agree with or Like or Trust":

https://t.co/COp62l0CZn

2019-04-18 at 05:30:47: He described a scene of beautiful deity figures as scarecrow puppets in a garden. 

"He wanted to make the children understand that all gods are homemade, and that it's we who pull their strings and so give them the power to pull ours." https://t.co/kBQywgPDbC

2019-04-18 at 05:30:47: Not that dissimilar to how we often center agency in corporations, when we tell stories. "Facebook" did this, "Google" did that. 

And, as Aldous Huxley wrote in Island, all gods are homemade.
https://t.co/SDpv1JwaOV

2019-04-18 at 05:30:47: The art cars move like vast neon whale gods, trailed by schools of worshippers. They interact, have allegiances and rivalries. 

And can be understood as centers of narrative agency. 
("Why all the effort, time, $?" "For the god.")

https://t.co/9W7ctmFg5b

2019-04-18 at 05:30:46: Ex: The scale of the most massive art cars at Burning Man is awe-inspiring, in the old meaning: " reverential respect mixed with fear or wonder"

Especially Mayan Warrior, Sanctuary, etc. 
"And the people bowed and prayed, to the neon god they made."

https://t.co/GuCKElkVbl

2019-04-18 at 05:30:46: Humans love to paint huge patterns with archetypal meaning, as a way to understand and interact. 

Patterns of creation, chaos, time, life, death, elements, nature, fertility, hunting, harvest, love, war... 

And we're making new concentrations of meaning and power. Gods?

2019-04-18 at 04:59:12: An odd stance: quasi-gods as Timothy Morton's "hyperobjects". 

Agency could be understood as outputs of enormous churning memetic systems; individual human actions just nodes in vast sweeping computations.

"Moloch" is an example:
https://t.co/bll6iIemQh

2019-04-18 at 04:59:12: No scattered thread of thoughts about gods &amp; responsibility would be complete w/o mentioning AI! 

Charles Stross, in fiction, describes "weakly godlike AI" - bound by physics, no miracles, but vastly exceeding human capacities. This essay gives a scale:

https://t.co/YQfQ4d7r4i

2019-04-18 at 04:47:57: Another stance: humanity as a sleepwalking god. Terrifying

Ecologist Paul Hirsch has described humanity as a "myopic giant" whose reach vastly exceeds its vision. 

Points at new modes of distributed sense-making that are needed to "think like a planet":

https://t.co/VdhLBPX6n7

2019-04-18 at 04:36:54: Second one is more about agency, sovereignty, choice. 

Power to control vast forces that were once considered the sole domain of the gods.

There's a stance in here that says, "We aren't gods. Not yet. We're still monkeys."

https://t.co/ZYRrXDfphf

2019-04-18 at 04:31:49: Another is to distinguish between ~ "godhood in origin" and "godhood in potential". 

The first one points somewhere around identifying with a ground of all being. 

(p.s. please note that words are hopelessly broken)

Alan Watts gives a flavor of it:

His later career unfortunately demonstrates what happens when you don't do that key filtering step - AIDS denialism etc.

2019-04-17 at 16:48:53: @reasonisfun @nabeelqu There's evidence for psychedelic-assisted "analytical" creativity too! Engineers, architects, mathematicians, scientists, programmers, etc.

https://t.co/Pp3HIlqE7Z

2019-04-16 at 17:04:40: @QiaochuYuan Just saw Nora Bateson's recent essay on consent &amp; complexity, which reminded me of your thread:

https://t.co/KT4gvTj0QC

2019-04-16 at 15:46:57: @algekalipso The PDF points at voluntary hierarchical "mission teams" held within a collaborative heterarchy framework. 

Applying that to internal subagents is a little odd but doable. Resolves authoritarian goodself / badself splits (as described in "The Guru Papers"). 

7/

2019-04-16 at 15:42:45: @algekalipso Does your subagent power distribution model hold that hierarchy always = coercive and a flatter distribution / heterarchy / consensus always = more collaborative?

If so, I recommend p. 7-17 of this PDF:
https://t.co/ddFPiOJ8aI

6/

2019-04-16 at 15:36:46: @algekalipso "Internal Family Systems consilience" does resonate for me, although I've usually heard that word more re: knowledge systems than identity &amp; sense-making &amp; decision-making.
https://t.co/ghxZaH9TYP

Pointing at collaboration / synergetics / deep same-sidedness?

5/

2019-04-16 at 15:33:28: @algekalipso Lost me a bit on the "normal distribution" of subagent causal power in MDMA-like states. Bell curve... some subagents have high power, some have low, most have middling?

Not sure which distribution I'd expect from Perceptual Control Theory, in "healthy" state absent trauma.

4/

2019-04-16 at 15:30:19: @algekalipso "Empathogenic high-valence states" like MDMA? Internal wellspring of safety, love, compassion busts the warzone scarcity mentality?

Heals corrosive effects of PTSD on the ground of deep trust; see this thread for example:
https://t.co/DT3cjo1gkJ

3/

2019-04-16 at 15:24:51: @algekalipso And "Pareto structure" as in 80% of oomph comes from 20% of subagents, roughly approximating power law distribution?
https://t.co/JNijQ5fbVJ

Is that a bit like personality subagent warlords, a fractal feudal power structure? Coercive bc there's no time to sort it out?

2/

2019-04-16 at 15:19:29: @algekalipso Ok, I really want to grok this, and it's dense like a space-filling fruitcake! Help me unpack it?

So... "subagents" as in IFS subpersonalities / subroutines, ya?

2019-04-15 at 03:26:17: @luminousalicorn @liron Oh, wait - that figure was for sugarcane. Switchgrass is a US native with potential yields up to 10x, but it does need a conversion process we're still working on scaling up.

https://t.co/fmuvud3GuZ

2019-04-15 at 03:18:13: @luminousalicorn @liron But, some biofuels are way better than others! Brazilian sugarcane &amp; switchgrass are excellent, up to 7-8 times energy return. And algal biofuels don't compete with terrestrial farmland.

3/ https://t.co/OG64Xpt7dQ

2019-04-15 at 03:14:40: @luminousalicorn @liron Plus, corn ethanol directly competes with using corn for human food (or livestock feed, although that's also energy inefficient). Can drive up food prices globally in times of scarcity.

One of the many issues with trying to scale up biofuels hugely:

https://t.co/0T10ZhODST

2019-04-15 at 03:13:14: @luminousalicorn @liron Yeah! A few points: 

Net energy ratio (NER) or energy return on investment (EROI) is one key factor. 

Corn-derived ethanol is terrible at this! If you put 1 unit of energy into growing corn, you can get 1.3 units out as ethanol, maybe. Boring!

2019-04-05 at 14:30:22: @KarliePonett Ah, I think it becomes coercively culty when the group meaning is not made of / does not integrate or respect individual needs and meaning.

2019-04-03 at 22:19:39: @sallylepage Have you considered a cape blazer? 

When I see photos, I think - 
"Is this simply a man's blazer, or a woman's? 
NO! It is a glorious blazer, fit for a mighty Tremoctopus!"

And that's the sort of thing I look for in a jacket. https://t.co/GtfV5367Cd

2019-04-03 at 19:39:51: @Meta_Aesthetic And other approaches don't just combine different approaches, but integrate, like Nora Bateson's "warm data":
https://t.co/B2uebDm74u

2019-04-03 at 19:19:42: @Meta_Aesthetic Like different tools in a toolbelt, or... maybe more like a spectrum of attention. 

Like how you can turn the hose on a narrow stream to blast something clean, and then turn it back to a wide gentle shower to water plants.

2019-04-03 at 19:17:52: @Meta_Aesthetic And, I'd say that humans need both, in our lives as a whole. 

I guess the fluid mode might be to respond to circumstances dynamically, with a rational, focused, critical approach, or free-flowing, emergent, optimistic -- as needed.

2019-04-03 at 19:13:28: @Meta_Aesthetic Many groups need both!

For example: "Action hippies" can be found building infrastructure at Burning Man, Ephemerisle, etc - making spaces for spontaneous, creative play, and also dead serious about material tolerances, fire safety, supply lines, etc.

2019-04-03 at 19:03:04: @Meta_Aesthetic And the key is -- what is the purpose of the group, and is the approach well-aligned with its environment? 
An air traffic accident investigation group, probably makes sense to lean dour. 
A musical improvisation troupe, makes sense to lean a bit manic.

2019-04-03 at 19:00:46: @Meta_Aesthetic Maybe it maps a little bit to predictive processing models of depression &amp; mania?

"All your bets are risky, tread cautiously, hunker down, endure." 
vs
"Omg, all your bets are great! Yes! Do more of that, embrace life! Live your truth!"

https://t.co/3yVd9RY1QE

2019-04-03 at 18:56:50: @Meta_Aesthetic I got fired from an ayahuasca center due to this. Boss fixated on the healing power of belief, and there wasn't room for clear thinking.

They didn't want to dwell on the "negative", and so couldn't adequately prevent or mitigate risks. Inadequate first aid kit, etc.

2019-04-03 at 18:54:06: @Meta_Aesthetic OTOH, "Hippies" often resist constraints, and fear getting caught in systems that deny spontaneity, vibrancy, possibility.  

Even to the point of denying observations of external reality if they're disappointing, or don't make a good story.

2019-04-03 at 18:53:39: @Meta_Aesthetic I dropped out of grad school due to this; lack of emotional support &amp; couldn't bring in a big enough picture to feel meaningful. 

Felt caught in misaligned incentive landscape that narrowed possibilities until they didn't matter.

2019-04-03 at 18:51:58: @Meta_Aesthetic Rational / systematic groups often resist thinking that gets too weird / emotional / meta, threatens the rigid reliability of the system. 

Even to the point of denying experiences of internal subjectivity that don't fit the model of what's expected / what you should be feeling.

2019-04-03 at 18:51:19: @Meta_Aesthetic I've experienced this, definitely! Seems we need both -- vibrant wild unrestrained hypothesis generation, and also careful, considered pruning of those ideas, deciding where to place your bets. 

Many groups seem to fixate on one &amp; deny the other.

2019-04-03 at 16:40:27: Huh! The suggestion of using coal fly ash gave me pause, because I associate it with things like the Kingston TN coal ash disaster in 2008.

https://t.co/WQxSAkwvPm

2019-04-03 at 02:02:32: @TheAnnaGat "Non-naive trust" is also an important conceptual tool. 

Without it, folks get confused &amp; can encourage people to undermine their self-trust (gut + mind, ability to understand, predict, make bets) to uphold a norm or value of "trust" -- when the system isn't actually reliable.

2019-04-03 at 01:25:09: @TheAnnaGat And I think a key part of this is - what model of "trust" are you using? 

When you make bets of interacting with the world, and things don't go as planned, how does that relate to your self-trust?

This podcast takes a deep dive into "what is trust"?

https://t.co/dNDwxT8WGz

2019-03-25 at 19:28:05: Previous me didn't clearly separate out self-fulfilling &amp; self-conflicted experiences, so I would have lumped this awesome mug purchase into a confused category of "indulgences" - to be scrutinized carefully &amp; suspiciously, or doled out sparingly.

But now I have a better model!

2019-03-25 at 19:28:05: It feels great to be connected with the story of the lab that designed &amp; made it, to have an object that catalyzes discussions about pattern formation, and just to hold this awesome-textured science-infused tea vessel!

2019-03-25 at 19:28:05: Which is more about, what comes out of this? Do we want that outcome? Does it make sense? Is it feasible? If not, can it become feasible? 

And, let me tell you, I am enjoying the heck out of this experience!

2019-03-25 at 19:28:05: Oh! Right! The selfie of me with the nervous system cup is an example of the self-fulfilling &amp; self-centered quadrant! 

It would've been hard to "justify" the purchase to myself a year ago. And I do feel like I'm using a different operating system now.

2019-03-25 at 18:47:43: Self-conflicted &amp; selfish: "Ohh god, why did I eat all that ice cream?‚Äù

Self-full &amp; selfless: ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no place I‚Äôd rather be than this monastery.‚Äù

Self-full &amp; selfish: [Something like, "Oh my god yes, I am the focus of this moment and it is AMAZING!!!"]

2019-03-25 at 18:45:25: Looking at this, I might substitute "Self-fulfilling". (I seem to be a verb!)
Or self-centered for selfish?

2019-03-25 at 18:31:23: Yes! Rethinking Narcissism has an extremely useful mode, and describes a scale from unhealthy self-denial / "echoism" --&gt; healthy narcissism (pursue your dreams while remaining in caring relationship with others) --&gt; unhealthy narcissism.

https://t.co/zIS2hrm43k https://t.co/iMuCDeNnmE

2019-03-24 at 16:37:15: @DRMacIver @judy2k Makes sense! These kinds of observations can be used to sculpt your incentive / motivation landscape so that actions which support your long-term wellbeing feel "downhill" and become easier to do:

https://t.co/GGJePxKL4J

2019-03-24 at 16:34:29: @DRMacIver @judy2k And it's deeply okay to make those tradeoffs! Social observation of messiness is not an infinitely bad outcome!

In fact, any situation where one outcome seems "infinitely bad" will warp reasoning, and make it very hard to navigate sensibly &amp; compassionately.

2019-03-24 at 16:33:44: @DRMacIver @judy2k I have found that this can still be a little uncomfortable, but no longer leads to panic / distress. 

I've been able to look back at my actions, and accept myself in having made choices to do other things instead of cleaning, and seeing how those choices made sense in context.

2019-03-24 at 16:33:02: @DRMacIver @judy2k I can now reliably use this as a catalyst, while having removed its fangs (the part about, "you will be judged and found unworthy if it's not in an acceptable state"). 

To test this mindset shift: What happens when people come over and the house is not in a state that I enjoy?

2019-03-24 at 16:31:21: @DRMacIver @judy2k But a few years ago, I took a look at this. I noticed that I could reframe this as: "Guests coming over reliably gives me a boost of energy towards making my space a nicer place to live, which I also enjoy."

2019-03-24 at 16:30:47: @DRMacIver @judy2k One stopgap measure I found that has worked reliably, has been a mindset shift around "cleaning before guests arrive." 

I grew up with this as Southern hospitality based on fear and shame: if other people saw that the house was messy, it was wrong and bad and terrible.

It's a more enjoyable space to live when they are fixed, and it's a lot of work but generally satisfying.

2019-03-23 at 12:52:33: @reasonisfun Ah, that's a good point! Haven't yet watched the video, but the ability to be with the "not knowing" is a key component of inviting / allowing outcomes that are better than you could have expected!

Tree bogs also seem interesting, especially for low impact / intermittent uses like campsites &amp; festivals:
https://t.co/bNrtxSQNj2

2019-03-21 at 20:46:38: ^ This distress is also called "pre-success failure." I'd say that, along w/self-judgment, it's a leading cause of "ugh fields" and flinches that interfere with actually making progress towards the goal state.

@Malcolm_Ocean have you written about pre-success failure anywhere?

2019-03-21 at 20:46:38: In the perceptual control theory sense of "error correction" or Robert Fritz's "creative tension", the journey towards the set point or desirable state generally feels good. 

In the fault-finding mode, it probably feels bad and wrong and distressing until it's solved.

2019-03-21 at 20:46:38: The "towards!" vs solely "away!" navigation system also affects how you feel in the midst of bringing something from an undesirable state towards a desirable state.

2019-03-21 at 20:36:35: @reasonisfun, you might find this interesting! 

I recall that y'all have a different approach to the word "problem" - I might define it as being part of a "should" paradigm that I want to transcend, but I think y'all reclaim it in the spirit of joyous exploration?

2019-03-21 at 20:29:44: I definitely grew up with this as part of my "operating system." It's only been in the last few months that I've clearly identified this dynamic. 

Here's a snippet of a conversation from Dec 2018 (from a group where we sometimes record &amp; transcribe our convos for research):

7/ https://t.co/9Gh9wTqy8D

2019-03-21 at 20:29:44: Your guidance system doesn't *want* you to feel lost (in the perceptual control theory sense of "want"). Navigation is its job.

So it will helpfully make up problems so that you have something to steer by!

6/

2019-03-21 at 20:29:43: AND what's even more pernicious -- if you've been taught to navigate only by flinches and prioritize risk prevention / mitigation, then your entire navigational system will be based on finding faults and problems. 

If there is not a problem, you will feel lost.

5/

2019-03-21 at 20:29:43: Another component of this is, what navigation system are you using? If you don't feel "allowed" to want and strive and explore, then you'll navigate by flinches. 

It's like using a compass ("towards!") vs. a random walk that only bounces off of obstacles ("away!").

4/

2019-03-21 at 20:14:11: @algekalipso has also written about some of the pitfalls and potential positive directions in this area. If you want a fairly technical and transhumanist take on stuff like the hedonic treadmill, look for "Wireheading Done Right."

3/

2019-03-21 at 20:14:11: A lot of what folks call "experiential pica" - procrastination or distraction that feels like junk food - is a result of not feeling "permission" to trust what you most deeply want.

Interesting to hear how Ross describes his first (I think?) psychedelic experience.

2019-01-30 at 02:40:14: 2nd episode: Not for the squeamish! I'm *so glad* the center where I worked didn't mess with "colon hydrotherapy". Whew. The purgatives were awful enough!

2019-01-30 at 02:40:14: If you want a VERY detailed description of what a retreat is like, this series is great.

2019-01-30 at 02:40:14: Just starting #3 of 13 episodes of @OhNoPodcast at an #ayahuasca retreat, and -- y'all, it is spot on. They give unusual things a very thorough try, while also holding a scientific frame. I got fired from an aya center for being "too rational", and it really hits home!

2019-01-26 at 18:02:49: @tasshinfogleman @mikeredmer @helixly @Malcolm_Ocean Cool! Will check it out :)

2019-01-25 at 05:05:35: @Meaningness @Meta_Aesthetic Or maybe you're more into asking, "How do we bootstrap the whole damn cultural platform that would even begin to facilitate people asking these deep &amp; necessary questions?"

If so, that's what I'm working on, with others!

2019-01-25 at 05:01:53: @Meaningness @Meta_Aesthetic Maybe that's through the lens of a specific field or purpose like, "Metarationality for education / communication systems / ecology / politics / economics / spirituality / etc." As in, bringing that translation &amp; interconnection to a particular group.

2019-01-25 at 04:57:23: @Meaningness @Meta_Aesthetic I'm thinking that one way to explore would be, "What am I already involved with / familiar with / skilled in / interested in / caring about, and how might that connect with metasystematicity?"

2019-01-24 at 00:17:46: @Malcolm_Ocean Interesting discussion -- see Romeo's comment: "eliminating certain negative emotions seems to temporarily get rid of any motivation structures that were using those negative emotions as a building block. Things I really value seem to rebuild themselves on better foundations."

2019-01-16 at 02:03:21: @Conaw I see the Replacing Guilt series as like... a cable of cold steel resolve dropped from a helicopter into the "Kegan 4.5" nihilism chasm that David Chapman describes.

It won't get folks across the chasm to fluid mode, but it probably sucks less than wallowing deep in the pit!

2019-01-16 at 02:01:21: @Conaw Nate Soares' "Replacing Guilt" series has a lot of useful things to say in this area, especially the post "Don't steer with guilt":

https://t.co/WlzxuxMyh6

2019-01-16 at 01:56:11: @Conaw Hmm... I agree that specific guilt is more tractable than vague guilt. *And* I think there are more self-aligned ways of working with the gap between how things are and how you might want or imagine them to be in the future.

2019-01-14 at 21:27:09: @tasshinfogleman @dthorson @bonnittaroy I think of this as Star Trek trust! The crew has no idea what Captain Picard might do when the alien parasites exploit a temporal anomaly to phase shift half the ship -- but they trust that he's acting out of a deep adaptive same-sidedness with their shared purpose and values.

2019-01-14 at 21:26:14: @tasshinfogleman @dthorson @bonnittaroy They propose that some kinds of unpredictability can promote a deeper level of non-naive trust. I might not know what someone will do in a particular situation, but I trust that it will turn out to be in alignment with what we care about.

They explore predictable systems as having limited trust, what I call systematic trust. Constrained, contractual -- these systems limit options out of a fear of betrayal / defection. 
6/

2019-01-14 at 21:24:11: @tasshinfogleman Sometimes, you want to be "meta-systematically reliable." You're willing to trade off on predictability at a lower level, to support integrity on a higher level of mission/value/purpose. People involved are able to hear why, and glad you did!
5/

2019-01-14 at 21:22:43: @tasshinfogleman Sometimes, you want to be what I call "systematically reliable." Maybe you want to be on time because it's a context of low trust or low-bandwidth communication, where you're still building the groundwork for people to hear, "This is why I arrived after the agreed-on time."
4/

2019-01-14 at 21:20:04: @tasshinfogleman The answer depends on context, and on -- what are you trying to be highly reliable *at* and why? Coming from the idea of a "Highly Reliable Organization" / HRO -- see Managing the Unexpected book by Karl Weick:

It's pretty dense, and a long series of tweets, so I've made a separate thread:
1/

2018-12-20 at 20:54:17: @Meaningness @reasonisfun @Malcolm_Ocean @reasonisfun, where are you starting from? What does "meta" mean to you, and what do you want to use it for? Are you finding areas where you expect it to mean one thing and it seems to mean something else?

2018-12-20 at 20:52:55: @Meaningness @reasonisfun @Malcolm_Ocean An excellent question! Hofstadter's "I Am a Strange Loop" was probably my first and most solid intro to the concept of "meta" as a thing in itself... Gregory Bateson also uses it in his work a lot, but I'm not sure how / where he introduces the concept...

2018-11-09 at 21:07:30: Just found out about this excellent resource for #psychedelic research, the @MAPS Psychedelic Bibliography! Lots of full text articles available:

https://t.co/esnvAEJgiH

2018-11-09 at 20:18:42: 5. Glad I read this article. A lot of food for thought. Don't miss the contrasting "Statement on Open Science and Open Praxis" re: psychedelic research &amp; therapy, linked at end of Quartz piece:

2018-11-09 at 20:18:42: 4. Flabbergasted: Compass' therapist training includes only 1 weekend in person, and no req for having taken psilocybin themselves!  

"a scuba-diving instructor who‚Äôs never been scuba diving and is ‚Äúon the phone talking with the people under the water who are learning it.‚Äù"

2018-11-09 at 20:18:41: 3b: Is Compass tracking that psychedelic therapy may disrupt the very markets they're pursuing, or are they more focused on grabbing as much of the pie as possible? 

In contrast, B corps can navigate this with broader public interest in mind.

2018-11-09 at 20:18:41: 3. Quantz article cites multi-billion $ depression market. If psychedelics are "psychiatry's antibiotic" (@DrSessa) -- how does that change the market? 

Short course solution vs. long-term maintenance therapies -- which is more profitable? What's better for patients?

2018-11-09 at 20:18:41: 2. Holy crap: Compass' contracts can block research publications if it would interfere with their commercial &amp; patent interests. Compare MAPS: supports open sci &amp; has "'an anti-patent strategy' to ensure that no company‚Äînot even MAPS‚Äîcould patent therapeutic uses of MDMA".

2018-11-09 at 20:18:40: 1: @MAPS (a nonprofit) has set up a public benefit corporation to run the MDMA therapy clinical trials &amp; to eventually "balance income from the legal sale of MDMA with the social benefits" of research.

2018-11-04 at 18:29:01: @KevinSimler 3. Declare email bankruptcy - abandon the obligation to reply, but maybe still feel lingering guilt about "failing".

4. My favorite - break the anxiety slate! It's worthwhile at any point, on any scale, to notice that the institution of guilt etc gets in the way of solutions.

2018-11-04 at 18:22:06: @KevinSimler Options:
1. Wipe both slates clean every 7 years (jubilee).

2. Wipe the anxiety slate clean every April 30, and still consider the real-world impacts (annual debt forgiveness). Maybe you'd say, "Absent anxiety, this reply is still worth sending" - or maybe it's not!

(cont'd)

2018-11-04 at 18:19:53: @KevinSimler Hmm, if I'm taking it more thoughtfully... I'm wanting to separate out two kinds of email "debt". One involves the real-world impacts of not replying, and the other is about the burden of anxiety, guilt, angst, shame, obligation, etc.

2018-11-04 at 17:34:30: @KevinSimler There's also Email Debt Forgiveness Day on April 30! I used it as a Schelling point to send a few messages this spring.

 https://t.co/8gf48sv36e

2018-11-04 at 16:44:33: But let's take a side road onto cellulose degradation, because: weird termite gut symbiote facts!

They don't eat lignin, but termite guts are full of bizarre tiny critters. Many are eukaryotes (have nuclei) but are also sort of... party boats made of many bacteria. (cont'd)

2018-11-04 at 16:44:33: Do bacteria break down lignin? Ehh, sort of. There are some recent papers (search "bacterial lignin degradation" on Google Scholar). But that probably wasn't what caused the end of the Carboniferous. 

(Also, some party poopers cite climate, not fungi: https://t.co/sD5ctiyQPO )

2018-11-04 at 16:44:33: Lignin gives bark &amp; wood their strength. Nothing could eat it in the Carboniferous; that's why dead trees piled up. Eventually, white-rot *fungi* developed enzymes to break it down, and that's where we are today.

But -- tree-eating bacteria?

2018-11-04 at 16:44:33: First stop, Wikipedia: https://t.co/BfAnfvDP4L

So: all plants have structure because of cellulose. Bacteria &amp; fungi definitely degrade it; that's how cows digest grass, etc. But trees - starting in the Carboniferous - developed lignin as well. It's way harder to break down!

2018-11-04 at 16:44:32: The latest @dinosaurcomics has sent me on a science info quest! It's about the Carboniferous period and the question -- do bacteria eat trees? Winds up at protist charioteers!
