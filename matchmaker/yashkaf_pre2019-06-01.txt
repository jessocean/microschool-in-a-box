2019-05-17 at 18:50:53: Sisyphean - an acceptance of eternal loneliness, when one has fully made peace with the Atlassian predicament. Knowing that the rock is forever yours alone to push, and feeling grateful for it. /end

2019-05-17 at 18:47:34: Atlassian - existential loneliness born of the awareness that gaps between people are always intractable, that trust is never absolute. The realization that for all one's friends, lovers, and family, the central burden of your life is yours to bear alone.

2019-05-17 at 18:45:06: Promethean - a crippling fear of being alone, such that one welcomes an abusive or toxic relationship as long as it forestalls having to face true solitude.

2019-05-17 at 18:43:15: Penelopean - the loneliness of many celebrities, surrounded by throngs of people who want their company but always yearning for a soulmate that may or may not exist. Forsaking all possible connections because they fall short of your ideal.

2019-05-17 at 18:40:35: Medusan - self imposed loneliness, born of a fear that you will hurt others. A realization that you *are* an island, having drifted so far from collective human consciousness that merging back into it is impossible.

2019-05-17 at 18:37:31: Cassandran - a shock loneliness born in the moment of realization that while you can understand others, they will never understand you. The loneliness of a sudden atheist at temple, a skeptic in a mob of passion. A loneliness that is afraid to express itself.

2019-05-17 at 18:35:30: Narcissian - an egocentric loneliness, feeling that you don't need others at all and they don't much need you. A loneliness that reinforces your own narrative and self-image. Troubling, but not painful.

2019-05-17 at 18:32:25: A taxonomy of lonelinesses, occasioned by feeling profound loneliness and realizing that it's different from what I've felt before.  Please remember that nitpicking details of Greek myths on Twitter does not constitute human connection. 1/n

2019-05-06 at 13:39:33: @everytstudies The opposite approach is considering the question "is Semenya a woman?" or even "is she unfairly oppressed?" as the only important one. Maybe we should call these people "rube/bleggers" and the decouplers "vanadium hunters".

2019-05-06 at 13:38:06: @everytstudies A "node decoupler" sees "is Semenya XY or XX?", "should Semenya run in the women's division?" and "what pronouns to call Semenya?" as very seperable questions. "Is Semenya a woman?" is not even a good question, "woman" is a fake node that's not determined by either of those.

2019-05-06 at 13:26:44: @everytstudies Maybe it's about a different sort of decoupling, the separation of atomic nodes from the central "fake" one: https://t.co/SFQ840uukN

2019-05-05 at 22:27:49: Did one of the previous tweets make you upset or baffled? I think that people with different ideas about gender can understand each other to some extent, but contextualizers and decouplers are incomprehensible aliens to one another. #erisology @everytstudies 4/4

2019-05-05 at 22:24:33: To contextualizers, this is part of an eternal struggle about gender, race, colonialism, oppression, identity, etc. The fact that Semenya is black, lesbian, and South African matters a lot. How fast she runs doesn't matter at all. The exact opposite of what matters to the IAAF.

2019-05-05 at 22:19:20: To decouplers, the IAAF sole interest is running as a sport. The decision to classify runners into the male and female divisions is just about balancing the interests of spectators and athletes. It's no different than the decision to have 8 runners in a race instead of 6 or 10.

2019-05-05 at 22:16:21: Caster Semenya surfaces an obvious conflict around what gender means, but the more interesting conflict in this case is between decouplers and contextualizers. 1/4

2019-04-26 at 15:17:22: @ArtirKel The bonkers theory is that men who have good intimacy with their wives will never look at other women, that extramarital attraction or fantasies are symptoms of a sick marriage or a sick man. For a better model, I'm writing a long review of Esther Perel's "The State of Affairs".

P.S.
I wonder what @bryan_caplan thinks.

2019-04-22 at 20:18:27: Why a negative externality? Getting a degree to become a barista just makes it more expensive to become a barista. If no one got those degrees, the quality of cappuccinos wouldn't suffer but people would replace 4 years of nonsense with 4 years of income and freedom. 3/3

2019-04-22 at 20:16:09: Degrees either:
1. Teach skills that guarantee a high income (STEM BSc, MD).
2. Are pure signaling, and thus purely zero sum.

For #1 it's basically a progressive income tax. For #2, the degree is selfishly useful but creates a negative externality, and thus should be taxed.
2/3

2019-04-22 at 20:09:02: How about the government paying off student loan debt, financed by a tax on college degrees? No, no, calm down, hear me out. 1/3

Why should we expect people to reject xenophobia and embrace altruism, given that both are adaptive phenotypes?

2019-04-13 at 23:41:09: @BretWeinstein @RichardDawkins Bret, you make the point that to stop behaviors like genocide we must understand how they're adaptive to our lineage. But wouldn't that encourage those behaviors even more? "Killing these people is good for your grandkids" isn't a strong argument against violence.

2019-03-22 at 11:39:48: @rjgoodin It's what *some* of them have been saying. OTOH, under this framework a statement like "men can get pregnant too!" is nonsensical since "pregnant" is a real node that correlates with the (fake) node "woman".

2019-03-20 at 22:17:43: @jsdenain I read this years ago and forgot :) Still, redrawing the border of gender from chromosomes to self-identification is a slightly different project from just meditating on the fact that borders are fake. The latter is purely for my personal understanding and peace of mind.

2019-03-20 at 22:00:11: Now that a thousand genders are blooming, I am starting to think of man/woman as rube/blegg. When we see a lot of real things correlate (voice, chromosomes, boobs) we imagine a central "gender node" that controls them, but that node doesn't actually exist.

With that said, I'd be shocked to learn that a cutting edge discussion of rationality/economics etc. is taking place in a non-English European language.

2019-02-01 at 03:54:17: @primalpoly 1. Teaches compersion, so things that would make a monogamous person jealous (like a stranger flirting with your partner) make you happy.
2. Always being on the dating market keeps you self-improving and not complacent.
3. Makes you develop better communication and awareness.

2019-01-08 at 17:04:12: Now I see why people like @jordanbpeterson and @JonHaidt had to come from the psychology departments. No outsider would believe that "the masculine requirement to remain stoic and provide for loved ones" has to be defended *from* psychologists, instead of *by* psychologists.

2019-01-08 at 15:51:56: APA: "Masculinity is harmful."
Also APA: "Men were more negative about seeking mental health services."
Is it because psychologists (70% female) are taught that masculinity is pathological?
LOL, no. 
It's because "men are also impinged upon by patriarchy".

2018-12-23 at 06:45:32: @nbouscal How would you estimate it then? Let's say Pew keeps posting teasers to his videos on YouTube with a link to his new site, so a YouTube follower only has to click once to follow him on his own platform. I bet that &gt;50% will make the switch, especially the profitable ones.

2018-12-23 at 06:40:45: @drethelin Fine, I'm also on Twitter to interact with high-status people. But that's not where I put things I create - that all goes on https://t.co/3B25bPSJQA which I own for as long as I remember to renew the domain. If I'm kicked off Twitter I don't lose the platform for my content.

2018-12-23 at 05:01:18: The tech behind YouTube was hard to build in 2005, but in 2018 we know how to host videos. Or text. Or accept donations. A monster like PDP can become a legend if he takes the fight to YouTube, but he doesn't. All the monsters are domesticated, and I'm not sure why. 3/3

2018-12-23 at 04:55:25: C.f. PewDiePie who posts videos protesting YouTube... on YouTube. Dude has 20 billion views! He can move to his own site, get a higher % of ad $, host other non-PC comedians, and be immune to censorship forever. Is that not worth a drop in traffic as viewers adjust? 2/3

2018-12-23 at 04:51:41: Q: why don't creators move to their own platforms when Twitter, FB, Patreon et al fuck with them?

2018-12-04 at 17:33:52: It's basically becoming impossible to write about sex anywhere, from literary novels to Tumblr notes. I really would not have predicted that even as drugs and gay rights are being liberalized, the sexual revolution is getting rolled back. 🍆🤐 https://t.co/lqlbv1ybNA

2018-11-27 at 17:02:25: 8. Homo benchpress. Goes to the gym. A lot. Photos include: abs, pecs, deltoids, biceps.
9. Me. Thinks that your Twitter feed is more important than your OkCupid profile. If you're non-monogamous, close to NYC, and you follow me - we should grab a drink!

2018-11-27 at 16:58:50: 7. Homo pusillanimous. Not attractive, not interesting, and probably has several personal issues he needs to deal with before jumping back into dating. His profile is a meditation on quiet desperation. Photos include: selfies taken in bad lighting.

2018-11-27 at 16:58:07: 5.Homo gopus. A conservative transplant in a liberal city. Mentions "the old days" and "real women" a lot. Photos include: football, the flag, flag football.
6.Homo infidelis. He's married, but Ashley Madison is down. Photos include: a suit, a car. Photos don't include: his face.

2018-11-27 at 16:55:44: 4. Homo trojanus. He's a feminist, an ally, and he's invariably white. His profile uses the word "queer" a lot, but you're not sure he knows what it means. Photos include: pride parades and bashful smiles.

2018-11-27 at 16:55:14: 3. Homo netflix. He's "laid back" and "chill". So chill, in fact, that his profile mentions no hobbies, education, or employment. Photos include: couches, beers, nothing that's not inside an apartment.

2018-11-27 at 16:54:21: A taxonomy of 9 subspecies of the OkCupid male:
1.Homo goldmanii. A rich banker, he will make sure you know it. Photos include: a boat, a golf course.
2.Homo tinderis. His profile has 9 words, 5 of which are misspelled. Photos include: clothes, but a dick pic is soon forthcoming.

2018-11-26 at 23:12:03: Red Dead Redemption 2 beats most novels on story, movies on visuals, and TV shows on complexity. Desert Golfing beats the MoMA on modern visual art.

2018-11-18 at 19:17:52: But it works the other way too. @nntaleb's books are more popular with rationalists than @NateSilver538's, and his ideas are well respected. And yet every rationalist I asked is 100% rooting for Silver in their personal beef, based mostly on Taleb's personality. 2/2

2018-11-18 at 19:11:53: Rationalists are cognitive decouplers, which includes separating character from ideas. Is someone arrogant? Insensitive? A douchebag? We mostly care whether they're *right*.

2018-11-13 at 17:26:20: @drethelin I came to New York with zero friends and joined a company, a soccer team, and a rationalist meetup that have all been around longer than college's four years. Any large city has way more people like you than a college, and way more longevity.

2018-11-13 at 15:45:56: @drethelin Once you're 18 it's really not that hard to catch a bus to a permissive social environment and meet likeminded people there. Bus tickets and meetups cost a whole lot less than college.

2. The second kind of communism inevitably follows the first.

2018-08-21 at 17:25:00: @Aella_Girl I got a ton of hateful responses online to my criticism of antinatalism: https://t.co/UC76NBHgAS and a lot of it boiled down to "more life = bad". If you're anti-life, you'd be antinatalist, in favor of abortion, and against curing aging. If you're pro-life, the reverse.

2018-08-21 at 17:16:47: @Aella_Girl The latest "Life is short, that's the point" NY Times piece made me think that "pro-life" isn't just a slogan for conservatives, but a deep factor influencing people's attitudes. Thus, I predicted a negative correlation between support for more abortion and increasing lifespan.

2018-08-21 at 16:59:40: @mstajduhar1 Because I'm limited to 25 characters, and I assumesld that most of the responders wouldn't be in favor of less abortion. Read "same" as "same or less".

2018-08-21 at 15:17:37: @Aella_Girl if you RT or just steal this poll, I'll tell you my preregistered hypothesis.

2018-08-21 at 15:15:35: What's your opinion on:

1. It would be good if today abortion was significantly less limited and more widespread.
2. It would be good if in the near future we cured aging and people lived healthy to 1,000.

When people break someone's trust, they often "ghost" and disappear instead of admitting it. A contract worker who failed a project, a date who found someone better, etc.

But how could we evolve this instinct? You can't ghost someone in a 150 person tribe.

2018-07-29 at 05:30:52: @Aella_Girl Who came up with this cool question? 😎

2018-07-28 at 23:06:02: My new start up is taking Silicon Valley by storm: selling contraband plastic straws in the alley behind Starbucks.

2018-07-28 at 19:14:35: I'm flying west over the Pacific overnight. I plan to sleep all through Sunday, all 90 minutes of it.

2018-07-26 at 14:29:04: @Tenoke_ @ciphergoth Two ways to look at it:
1. We don't want to both underreport negatives AND overreport positives. P=0.04 crap takes away journal space from negative results. 
2. If you're stats-savvy and can look at funnel plots, you know that p=0.04 is usually a p-hacked negative result ;)

2018-07-26 at 03:07:19: Can't resist one more, it's so up my alley: "The main finding is r^2=0.08, p=0.04. I don’t see how journals publish stuff like this. Like, I get that you wasted your government or whoever’s grant money and need to show SOMETHING. Write a nice “we’re sorry” card. Don’t publish."

2018-07-26 at 02:59:09: If you like Putanumonit now, imagine how good it will be after I'm sent to federal prison for a few years. 

One last Shkreli quote to wrap this up: "I don’t give stock advice, and you should not ever listen to anything I say because I’m an idiot. Never come back here again."

2018-07-26 at 02:55:56: "The left needs to talk about unity instead of resistance. The right needs to reach across and stop the flame war, fun as it is. I was happy with Obama and with Bush. I’m always happy because there are more important things than driving yourself (and others) crazy with politics."

2018-07-26 at 02:47:21: On jail: "Jail is adult time out. I haven’t learned anything profound from this experience, other than doing what most prisoners do, which is to stew and grow more resentful of our overreaching and corrupt law enforcement."

2018-07-26 at 02:44:08: Writing a glossary of biomedical terms: "I’m a big proponent of self-education because there’s no other kind. [...] Generally, terms are easy to understand, but remembering them is tricky. Concepts are tricky to understand, but remembering them is easy."

2018-07-26 at 02:40:26: Some great quotes: "I couldn’t have a lower opinion of newswriters now that I’ve had folks report on me. I understand that not everyone can excel at their chosen career, and the reporting and chronicling of history is not a vitally important task to those charged with it."

2018-07-26 at 02:36:16: There's no blogroll on Putanumonit. In part because I prefer to diversify my reading, and in part, because very few writers can consistently educate, surprise, and delight me on a weekly basis. But if I have a feeling that https://t.co/imOD7pb5F0 will. I'm not joking.

2018-07-24 at 00:11:18: The US has systems in place that keep drugs very expensive, like barriers to entry of generics and Medicare's inability to negotiate prices. Is it Effective Altruism to lobby FOR those systems because this way rich Americans subsidize drug development for poorer countries?

2018-07-18 at 19:13:54: 2/4 "Looks don't matter, date someone who would be your best friend!"
Perhaps. And perhaps you have 20 best friends and a burning sex drive, and you should date really hot people who are great in bed.

2018-07-18 at 19:12:25: 1/4 "Study what you're interested in!" 
Perhaps. But perhaps you should study finance and read art history books at home.

2018-01-06 at 14:09:35: @tom_peters @GiveWell It turns out that the number of lives saved:
1. Is much higher than a philanthropy cynic would think if they don't read the research.
2. Depends on the logistics of bed net distribution, not on whether the charity is mood-affiliated with the proper anticolonial politics.

2018-01-06 at 14:05:37: @tom_peters @GiveWell Who talked about "on average"? @GiveWell researches the very best. It's not beyond us to calculate: lives/$ = lives lost / malaria infection * infections stopped / bed net * bed nets / $. Not in theory, but in Africa.

2018-01-06 at 03:02:54: @flatfingers0 @clairlemon I don't think it's "immoral" meaning "bad". I think it's orthogonal to morality, like rooting for one sports team over another. But the fact that I root for Spurs isn't an argument against utilitarianism! Most of the day-to-day decisions we make aren't really moral decisions.

2018-01-06 at 01:29:21: @flatfingers0 @clairlemon I don't want us to get stuck arguing about definitions, so I invite you to pick 1 below to argue with:
1. People caring about those closest to them is an efficient arrangement that makes the whole world better. Thus, it's utilitarian.
2. It doesn't, thus selfish.

2018-01-06 at 01:24:29: @tom_peters @bho82 @GiveWell Is anyone really arguing that FB is salutary because Zuck donates? My qualm is only with dismissing philanthropy. The next FB will still try to sell our souls (and we should fight it!), but its owner may not use the $ to literally try and cure all disease. https://t.co/9cWnHmAET0

2018-01-06 at 01:17:29: @tom_peters @GiveWell It wouldn't suffice for me, although I admire the spirit. The best third-world health and poverty charities are 100x more effective than US-focused orgs: https://t.co/0ZfJezFOLs. As for political charities, I am rather uncertain that their net impact is even positive.

2018-01-06 at 01:10:22: @tom_peters @GiveWell I agree, $10k can do a lot of good! Last time I raised $10,000 we fed a village for months: https://t.co/9PlEpwfliE And Zuck can do a million times as much good. In fact, FB co-founder @moskov already IS doing a million times as much good with @open_phil .

2018-01-05 at 22:43:10: @clairlemon Instead of forcing personal well-being to equal utility, why not admit that we all sometimes indulge in selfish, immoral things like... partiality? I'm a utilitarian, but I'm not 100% moral. It's a goal to strive for.

2018-01-05 at 20:06:17: @bho82 @tom_peters @GiveWell I agree that it's complex, disagree that it's unimaginable, and strongly disagree that you can round off the impact of Zuck's $45B to zero without a shred of evidence.

2018-01-05 at 19:07:16: @bho82 @tom_peters @GiveWell Evidence, shall we?

Zuck has donated $3B so far to health orgs, has $45B more to give. The best health orgs save a life for $4k, let's say that doesn't scale and Zuck only gets 1 life / $45k. That's 1 MILLION LIVES SAVED. 

Your turn.

2017-12-24 at 14:06:23: @ESYudkowsky @primalpoly If we share what we need for survival (time, money), people admire it. If we share a mate, they freak out. So giving up some survival is worth it if it makes us appear sexy, but giving up sexual access can never be worth it. Doesn't this imply that sexual selection matters?

2017-12-23 at 01:45:01: I'm just 20 pages into @primalpoly 's book and I realized how much I've underestimated sexual selection for altruism. Many people will help or give money to a friend in tough times, but do you know anyone who will share their spouse with a lonely friend?

2017-08-17 at 05:04:26: 3/ Metalworking technology improves, we learn to remake statues faster. Research improves, we learn about people's moral failings faster.

2017-08-17 at 04:50:23: 2/ Old statues are torn down, melted, recast as people from more enlightened eras. Then their moral failures come to light, and it repeats.

2017-08-17 at 04:46:45: 1/ Statues of people who don't fit contemporary moral standards may not stand, but moral standards keep evolving faster and faster.

2017-07-26 at 16:01:55: @Meaningness @smoofra @slatestarcodex @danlistensto You made this point yourself. I'm just reiterating why the lack of explanations by meta-Rs is such a strike against it, by its own measure.

2017-07-26 at 15:58:24: @Meaningness @smoofra @slatestarcodex @danlistensto This "understanding" then seems to be perfectly suited to good explaining, which is a complex and context-dependent challenge. And yet...

2017-07-26 at 14:26:34: @smoofra @Meaningness @slatestarcodex @danlistensto Whereas rationalists are willing and often able. The motivation for Rationality is Rat=winning. The motivation for meta-Rationality is ???

2017-07-26 at 14:19:43: @smoofra @Meaningness @slatestarcodex @danlistensto The fact that the median meta-rationalist is unmotivated and unable to explain herself makes me wonder why anyone should even try to grok it https://t.co/mL9lMygc9Q
