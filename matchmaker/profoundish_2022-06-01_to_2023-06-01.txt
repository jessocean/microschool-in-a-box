2023-05-31 at 16:05:53: Srsly, it feels like people who view the world as *only* matter should be the ones *most* committed to remembering that humans are material bodies, and noticing that all parts of the body are *materially* linked to each other! 

(I know it's cuz the Enlightenment(TM) but still)

2023-05-31 at 16:05:53: And the brain is directly linked -- is the *same* thing -- as the rest of the nervous system, from the brain-stem down to every single sensory-receptor within your body and its outside. Even if you want to say that 'we' are nervous systems. . . a nervous system is p embodied!

2023-05-31 at 16:05:52: "So what, you think God interacts with the world from some astral dimension or something?"

I mean, where do you think your brain is interacting with the rest of your body from?

"The brain's separate though!" Is it? Blood/brain barrier still has a degree of porousness, 1st off

2023-05-31 at 16:05:50: You'd think that people with materialist worldviews would be the first to tell you that the brain is part of the body and that there is no mind but body-mind 🤔

This isn't just a dunk I'm genuinely curious how so many smart people fail to notice this inconsistency.

2023-05-26 at 22:05:25: @0bviouSquirre1 All that said, I am about as wide-open a door on mercy as I can be. No sin too big for forgiveness. But they do actually have to see it as a sin.

In my head, Hell is less about punishment and more about honoring free will.

2023-05-26 at 22:03:03: @0bviouSquirre1 It's still universal Christian theology, if you're at all the sort of person who cares about that sort of thing: God only forgives the genuinely contrite. If monsters want to keep being the kind of people who deserve God's smiting justice, God will still smite, even post-Jesus.

2023-05-26 at 22:01:26: @0bviouSquirre1 now ofc, many people ignore this. but i think those people would prolly find other frameworks for self-justification.

2023-05-26 at 21:58:26: @0bviouSquirre1 fwiw the framework for Confession is p clear that there has to be genuine  1) recognition of what you did, 2) of why what you did was wrong, 3) a genuine agreement that it was wrong, based in an actual understanding of the act and its context and not just mindlessly assenting.

2023-05-26 at 21:54:00: @Hooberland_ @towheretobegin @RichDecibels Which I totally think can be used as an excuse to say, "Oh see, they still do ultimately have a choice though!" and ignore systemic realities, 100% agree w that. Still, it feels weird to put a cap on theoretical agency-- it's hard to know how 'free' someone is from the outside

2023-05-26 at 21:52:08: @Hooberland_ @towheretobegin @RichDecibels I vibe w most of what you're getting at, but this seems a bit off-- well, I guess I'm just wondering at what point differences in contexts make comparisons less useful. But more importantly, I do think there's a degree/framework within which one can have agency in *any* situation

2023-05-26 at 20:26:31: @forthrighter That's an incredible metaphor, and an evocative one -- I'll check it out!

2023-05-26 at 19:32:44: @scalinglaws @RichDecibels @towheretobegin Yeah, but I will concede that how much it impacts your agency is v path-dependent, and choosing one's path is itself correlated with agency. I want to live in a dense-ish area in a house-sized space, and I want kids. But those are choices, I do absolutely have agency there.

2023-05-26 at 17:25:48: @RichDecibels @towheretobegin Define 'very low wealth' plz? Not that I think poverty's an absolute limit on my agency (and there are many workarounds for lack of funds) but my life definitely gets *markedly* easier when we're making at least $20k/yr/household-member.

2023-05-25 at 03:14:37: Ahhhhhhhhh, no, I'm seeing a deeper thing: I have not until recently really been able to trust myself /at all/ not to be overly influenced by outside feedback -- completely floating in the wind of outside opinions. So ofc I can't publish until I have my mind made up on s/t!

2023-05-25 at 03:14:36: Like there are a few things that I haven't published because it's about something really important to me and I know it could be a lot better still. But like. . . I can just publish the draft and come back to it later. It doesn't need to be a perfect manifesto the first time.

2023-05-25 at 03:06:58: If I were trying to maximize audience size it might make sense to worry about hypersaturation, but I'm not.

&amp; there's a lot of guilt wrapped up in it for me. The pain is painful /and/ I often see it as a symbol of all the ways I mistreated my body (mostly at jobs/school). 

Huh. I haven't forgiven myself for that mistreatment. That's prolly important.

2023-05-24 at 17:25:38: @calnthoughts But purposeful avoidance seems like 85% of it for me. There's a lot of pain and unpleasant sensations in my body. Some problems that are either currently intractable or just take a while to fix but are in-progress. I'm in p much constant pain in my shoulders/neck. Escaping that.

2023-05-24 at 17:23:26: @calnthoughts Tasty spaghetti! So ye, not as much social context for discussing embodiment, and we think about what we talk about. And there's definitely an 'ease of movement' component -- I often imagine a feeling of floating in mid-air, embodied but not weighed down.

https://t.co/5qitBPyr5r

2023-05-21 at 22:57:30: But idk, I've got to do it, right? I need people. Even if I also need lots of solitude, even if I have to get good at keeping myself company, I still need more people. Like, in the flesh-world. That has to start w the contexts I have or can naturally step into. Church being one.

2023-05-21 at 22:57:30: Well and I suppose there's the reality that this is something of an experiment. There's no way to know how my body reacts around people now except to find out. So I'm constantly learning about it, but it does take a portion of my attention. It's still really about /me/. Dissonant

2023-05-21 at 22:57:29: I have this... Idk, this gap, though. Or a shield. A moat? I felt a little bit removed the whole time. Hypervigilant against having my framework hijacked, I think. Which is not an entirely foolish measure. But it can make it hard to reach across to me.

2023-05-21 at 22:57:29: It's not that there's no tension at all, but -- for one thing, I'm aware of it, and that didn't really used to be the case lmao. But I'm just generally a lot less caught up in worrying constantly about the group dynamics or whatever, and just letting things happen and responding.

2023-05-21 at 22:57:28: Like my whole body reacts completely differently. I really used to be very, very, very terrified of people in some fundamental way. I felt like I had to constantly keep myself constrained in order to keep from... Idk what. Getting beat up, I guess? I mean, that was a thing. Hmm.

2023-05-21 at 22:57:28: I hung out in a group of 8 today after church, and that is the first time I've interacted face-to-face with that many at once in /years/ in an actually-social situation, and not just as strangers in proximity.

2023-05-17 at 20:50:36: 1 Kg 19 is patterned on Ex 33 is patterned on Gen 18 and Gen 32, which are all related in various ways to Gen 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8.

I'm sure there's still more for me to notice/have pointed out to me -- like I said, I haven't even looked at 1 Kg 19 itself yet

It's all like this 🙏

2023-05-17 at 20:50:35: Palm of her foot is a kind of interesting phrase, right? It also shows up as "Palm of the loins," ie the hip socket. Of Jacob, in Gn 32:25 having an encounter with God or an angel or?

I've left so much out. And it's just so dense and interconnected.

2023-05-17 at 20:50:35: In fact, there's a word in Gen 18, where Abraham offers God a place to rest and wash their *feet*, that also gets used in the flood narrative -- it's about the Dove (seen by Christians as the Holy Spirit) looking for a place of dry land to rest 'the palm/sole of her *foot*'

2023-05-17 at 20:50:35: And of course, scattered through /all/ of these there are allusions to the Creation story, to the planting of the Garden, fleeing from God, taking the forbidden fruit, Cain murdering Abel, the flood, and the covenant with Noah.

2023-05-17 at 20:50:34: I haven't even gotten to it yet, actually? Because that story is very much patterned on the story from Exodus 33, where Moses encounters God. But then it turned out that of course that story is /also/ patterned on/with Gen 18, where Abraham has an encounter with God or angels or?

2023-05-17 at 20:50:34: So I wanted to write about 1 Kings 19, when Elijah encounters God, since I saw something about it earlier and my attention is easily hijacked -- well actually I've just wanted to collect some juicy Bible stories? This ended up being /very/ juicy. Uh. . .

My gut, educated guesses, etc

2023-05-15 at 18:41:50: @forthrighter But I should caveat this all by saying that I'm just some side-line enthusiast, I'm not even an IT professional of any kind, let alone LLM's.

2023-05-10 at 21:31:54: Allowing for copies just adds a wrinkle to selfhood, it doesn't collapse it. The idea that it can diverge or split into copies, or even be picked up and spun up eons later

Oh she actually goes into that a bit.

And then dies. . .

The end ig!

2023-05-10 at 21:31:54: She does at least start exploring the idea that the brain is material, by imagining someone making a physical duplicate of a brain.

They also keep assuming that there can't be multiple of the same self -- like, on the level of 'if more than one copy is made, neither are OG!Self'

2023-05-10 at 21:31:53: Yeah and then Cohen immediately doubles down on this bifurcation. What a wreck!

Weirob throws out an interesting idea, implying that identity is a person's relationship to a self-concept, often memory-chains.

2023-05-10 at 21:31:53: So even if Julia's brain-memories were preserved, all of the bodily context would be missing; and likewise, it would have all of these new body-memories with no brain-context. These two unrelated patterns might be able to stabilize into a third person, but it seems unlikely to me

2023-05-10 at 21:31:52: I highly doubt that kind of brain transplant is really possible at all. The nerves aren't just, like, separate cords, like a phone-line plugging into the router-that-is-you. The division is for simplicity, but it's fake.

2023-05-10 at 21:31:52: Weirob says no, but then makes the unfounded claim that it would be Mary, 'because it's her body.' But it's not like the brain isn't part of the body! Imo, *either* this is a ship of Theseus problem, *or* the resultant person is a new, entirely 3rd person.

2023-05-10 at 21:31:51: The biggest annoying assumption is that they keep treating the body and the brain as completely separate. A scenario is presented wherein the brain of Julia is put into the body of Mary. Is this new person Julia? Cohen and Miller say yes, obviously -- Julia's brain.

2023-05-10 at 21:31:51: Like bruh, have you never heard of Christianity? We're admittedly a lot better at showing 1 = 3 than 1 = 2, but just ask Jesus how many persons He is, it's a whole fuckin' rabbit-hole xD

2023-05-10 at 21:31:50: All parties involved keep making points/moves that ultimately seem pretty spurious. I guess this is perhaps my own bias about what kinds of objections one has to seriously contend with.

And really bold assumptions, like: "One cannot be identical with two."

2023-05-10 at 21:31:50: Further down, after Cohen joins, Weirob summarizes his argument about memory thus: "A person is a certain sort of causal process." She adds, the "causal chain from remembered event to memory of [said event] never leads us outside the confines of a single body.

2023-05-10 at 21:31:49: Like he clearly thinks about the human person as one solid 4D structure, but he'll only briefly put it forward that way before hurrying into arguments about /memory/ specifically, which. . . is just gonna lead to more complications.

2023-05-10 at 21:31:49: Miller actually has a lot of more interesting ideas that he doesn't flesh out very well b/c he's being overly conventional -- which is to say, Perry is having him stick at a lower level of the conversation for the audience's sake, I think.

2023-05-10 at 21:31:48: I imagine they're gonna get caught up on which connections are the identifying ones, and/or who gets to decide that. Let's watch. . .

Yeah immediately. Obviously. And I bet this is where my 18 y/o brain started lighting up xD

2023-05-10 at 21:31:48: He talks about how the nature of the connection can actually be quite fluid and malleable -- how the second game could start with all the same players, or the first game could continue with new players substituted in, for example.

2023-05-10 at 21:31:47: Early in the 2nd night, Miller starts talking about how really any claim of identity is a claim of connection between parts -- he uses the example of someone who leaves for a long time toward the end of game one of a doubleheader and then asks, 'Is this still the same game?'

2023-05-10 at 21:31:47: Okay, this kinda shit is why I wanted to dig through the archives: Just found notes on John Perry's /A Dialogue On Personal Identity And Immortality,/ and I had *completely* forgotten about it, but I'm re-reading it now and it clearly had a *huge* impact on me.

2023-05-10 at 18:45:43: It's not the /most/ sophisticated analysis but I was 16! I didn't have to go that hard lol. They're definitely useful enough to be added to my notes, which I did *not* expect from any of the highschool stuff

2023-05-10 at 18:45:42: Ooohh! I just found this thing I did as a sophomore in highschool: I summarized each chapter of the Bospel of Matthew into 1-2 short paragraphs, listed off all the Tanakh references I could find in each chapter, and other interprative notes.

2023-05-10 at 18:25:34: There was another idea in there, more implicit:

Relationships as sets of affordances.

I need to let it percolate more, but I think those definitions would blend well together. Helps w the fact that, in some circumstances, meaningful interaction is *itself* a non-trivial request

2023-05-10 at 18:25:34: Ahhhh, yes, this is more like it:

Relationships ongoing exchange of requests in a broader context of meaningful interactions.

For me, I guess that was the only angle I'd even let myself see certain problems from at that point in my life? It was the needed pendulum swing that got me to admit I was constrained in the first place.

But yeah. So blurry 
😶‍🌫️
⭕⚔️⁉️ 🆚 🚫🧱⁉️

2023-05-09 at 17:45:00: I am honestly v grateful for my struggles with agency, effectiveness, executive function, and power in general. I am at my core quite competent; without such struggles my lack of understanding for other's situations would've been a huge vector for obnoxiousness. Still could be.

2023-05-09 at 17:44:59: As always this just means I need to focus on myself and my own struggles in this area, and trust that to radiate outward when it can actually make a difference, instead of further entrenching ppl I'd like to see liberated.

2023-05-09 at 17:44:58: Not without getting into close enough relationship to them that an awareness of their 8oSing would just naturally arise anyway. 

But damn it sucks to clearly see a pattern and not be able to point to it clearly enough to be helpful.

2023-05-09 at 17:44:58: . . . more difficult a challenge than is prolly appropriate at their current working (net) 'power level''; or they detect the BS of others and don't see their own.

Everyone has a mix of intractables and 8-of-Swords, and you can /guess/ from the outside but you can't /know/

2023-05-09 at 17:44:57: It's hard to get someone to admit that there are any 8-of-Swords in their life when others are trying to gaslight them into thinking that all of their problems are 8-of-Swords problems. They either buy it, and  often throw themselves at intractable problems that are actually. . .

2023-05-09 at 17:44:56: And ofc the hard part is that p much /everyone/ has a mix of both problems that are genuinely hard and then more 8-of-Swords situations making things unnecessarily hard on themselves.

2023-05-09 at 17:44:56: But I still find far more annoying any (temporarily) high-agency person who have so little compassion and sympathy for those stuck in negative feedback loops, and/or who assume anyone with any intractable problems must be doing to themselves. And/or conflate these two things.

2023-05-09 at 17:44:55: There is no sharp clear line where victim mentality ends and an accurate assessments of the limitations in your life begins.

But damn is it harder for me now to deal with people further on the former side of that spectrum than it was when I was being brainwashed into cynicism.

2023-05-08 at 18:55:12: But tbh I wonder how much I'd care if I weren't also a 6' trans woman walking around (with a confident though visibly wonky gait) in short shorts and tank tops all summer. It feels like adding barefoot to all that is 'too much, ' for whatever reason.

(Also the whole body is mind, not just brain)

2023-05-07 at 18:03:44: It's probably not worth it to tag all 30K tweets (maybe v slowly/passively over long time), but having them all there and then perhaps moving the more important ones to a separate folder and tagging those, that seems like a reasonable compromise.

2023-05-05 at 20:49:11: @UntilTrees his colleagues came and begged him to come finish the series out and he basically said, "Sure I'll do it, but it's gonna be weird and not that great," and they said, "Fine!" And so that's what we got: you can see what he was aiming for, but he just had to rush it out mid-crisis

2023-05-05 at 20:47:24: @UntilTrees I wish I knew more specifics, but I just know that basically the show was all Anno's at the end of the day, but that he had some serious mental health nosesdive as the last few episodes were coming due, but no one else could really capture his 'je ne sais quoi', so. . .

2023-05-05 at 20:40:35: @UntilTrees Yeah it's. . . a lot! Challenging in places. But I liked 'em both xD And yeah the series' ending was definitely undercooked. Do you know the production story behind that, Hideaki Anno's mental health and all that?

2023-05-05 at 20:36:04: @UntilTrees Did you watch the End of Evangelion movie? (Not the remake movies but the original sequel movie.) I did /not/ the first time I watched eva, but it's worth a watch if you enjoyed the last few episodes. (I know nothing about the remake movies. They seem okay? 🤷‍♀️)

2023-05-05 at 20:34:36: Last night, I was feeling chilly even though it was plenty warm out, so I made the luxurious decision (since wife is over at meta's) to turn on the heater, bump it up a degree.

2023-05-05 at 05:06:43: @myceliummage many such cases

(also: same.)

2023-05-05 at 02:37:17: @KanekoTheKoolio ig the idea of 'two things being united despite being distinct' is p Christian tho? I am body and soul, I *am* body but I'm not *only* body. I don't think there's any kind of hard line where one begins and one ends. But ghosts sure seem to be a thing 🤷‍♀️

https://t.co/oPyWLsoNWE

2023-05-05 at 02:34:41: @KanekoTheKoolio Well and this is where I run up against the boundaries of how precisely I think I can know any of this shit xD 'Cause I do think there's something of an immortal immaterial component that can live on, but I *also* think the body is more than just some attachment. Hard to unpack

2023-05-05 at 02:33:16: @forthrighter Ig that's it. It appears that some kind of disembodied state is possible in the Christian narrative, but only as a pit stop to an embodied resurrection. And if the ghost in between is 'me,' it's a greatly diminished, greatly changed version waiting reunion with the rest of itself

2023-05-05 at 02:30:50: @losingcontrol23 For a lot of people the 'obvious' answer would be, "Well we can just make clones!" but. . . that's basically the mirror version of the problem?

2023-05-05 at 02:29:55: @losingcontrol23 10000% I couldn't possibly be one of the first people to do such a thing, because I'd want to hear a fuck ton of testimonials about what it's like to be a digiman, 'cause I can't imagine them not yearning for reembodiment.

2023-05-05 at 01:14:43: It always seemed like the pattern buffer held everything together as it traveled in atomized form through subspace. Or something.

What's the "or something" that's gonna make a digital upload not just killing my human body at the same time as making a digital copy?

2023-05-05 at 01:14:43: This is like transporters in Star Trek. 

The common critique is that what's really happening is that a person at point A is disintegrated and a copy is made at point B, but that's never felt like a reading that's actually faithful to the way we see the transporters work.

2023-05-05 at 01:14:42: So I've been curious: when people say they're gonna upload their brains and live forever, what does that really mean? 

I could imagine a simulacrum of me existing in digital space, but that's not /me/, that's a copy of me at best.

Right? Am I missing something?

A live-tweet thread, basically: https://t.co/1IrYOR7A95

2023-04-29 at 18:45:10: PART 2 HERE:

https://t.co/M86qA4evm2

2023-04-29 at 18:45:09: Luther had really hoped Erasmus would take a more solid position and stand with him, but E. demurred, saying he didn't want to threaten the independence of his scholarship. Luther took this poorly, and blasted him for being a coward or a vacillator.

[There's still more, pt 2:] https://t.co/7ofFnUxV5E

2023-04-29 at 18:45:08: He and Luther ended up writing letters with each other, ofc. He actually had a lot of respect for Luther and agreed with many of the reforms Luther was calling for. Luther, for his part, really respected Erasmus as a scholar, freely admitting he felt outclassed in that regard.

2023-04-29 at 18:45:08: Perhaps in part *because* the book wasn't in the hands of anyone who couldn't read Latin or Greek, [that's wild speculation on my part, as is a lot of this tbh,] it was actually pretty well received, and he was somewhat surprised to find that it didn't hurt him v much to publish.

2023-04-29 at 18:45:08: There were certainly stories that the Pope got his hands on a copy of the work, which certainly said a lot of things that could put the Pope in a bad light, though never outright decrying the Pope himself. Reportedly, he thought it was pretty funny.

2023-04-29 at 18:45:07: Publishing in Latin meant (for better or worse) that he reached a smaller, but higher status, audience. But the book contained criticisms of both the Church and of the Protestants, a satire delivered as a speech from the *literal* personification of moronic stupidity, Stultitia

2023-04-29 at 18:45:07: And so he just doubled down on what he believed: he published a book called 'Morias Enomion / Id Est: / Stultitiae Laus / Desiderii Erasmi Roterodami Delamatio'
that is,

'PRAISE OF FOLLY [Grk], 
that is, Praise of Folly [Ltn], 
a declamation of the desire of Erasmus Roterodamus'

2023-04-29 at 18:45:06: Then the Protestant Reformation started. Erasmus hated those vibes, because (and again I'm resonating v hard w this) he often found himself overly constrained and caught between two warring factions. But he was a scholar of too much note to not get drawn in to the debate.

2023-04-29 at 18:45:06: I had no idea the Textus Receptus was his, that blew my mind. It was the basis of a lot of the scholarship that followed, and remains (though edited by later generations) one of the more important primary sources for Biblical scholarship today.

2023-04-29 at 18:45:05: Tyndale's translation was a *huge* influence on the King James Version, and thus, on p much every single translation of the Bible into English, through lineage.

The 6th edition of his Greek NT text became known as the 'Textus Receptus' -- *the* 'Received Text.' https://t.co/Hfsn66tnPB

2023-04-29 at 18:45:04: Later, when Luther published his German translation of the NT, it was Erasmus's Latin text that was provided on the other side, rather than the institutional gold standard of Jerome's vulgate. Tyndale may have also used Erasmus's Latin to produce his English translation. https://t.co/vdo3X8tw27

2023-04-29 at 18:45:04: A couple times in his career, a rush to publish actually led to a bunch of errors and the need for him to rush even more, editing and correcting and sending it to J Froben to rush out a new edition as fast as he could.

2023-04-29 at 18:45:03: He actually produced the first ever manuscript of the New Testament with Greek on one page, Latin on the facing page. At the time he'd had to compile his own critical Greek edition, as there were no whole manuscripts available. https://t.co/Cml7nKeeLx

2023-04-29 at 18:45:03: His flight took him to Basel, Switzerland, where he felt he had much more freedom. He thrived here: he met publisher Johann Froben and his son Hieronymus, who'd go on to be co-author of over 200 works w him, he was generally well-liked, and  'notables' *traveled* to see him.

2023-04-29 at 18:45:02: His next gig was the U of Leuven, which did expose him to Hebrew -- he'd call for the establishment of a college teaching Latin, Greek, and Hebrew --  and some friends, but also exposed him to a lot of bitter cynical pushback; he soon left Leuven, fleeing 'mental persecution.'

2023-04-29 at 18:45:01: He had a stop in Venice, getting one of his books re-printed by a well-known printer, and being the companion of a fellow humanist, philosopher Giulio Camillo.

2023-04-29 at 18:45:01: He'd long wanted to go to Italy, so when the sons of the King of Italy's personal physician happened by, he leaned on his prior exp of giving rich men some 'company' on a trip, sailing home w them; and that was his ticket to the University of Turin, where he earned his DDiv.

2023-04-29 at 18:45:01: A lot of people in England had opportunities they wanted him to pursue -- even the King wanted something out of him -- but he and John Colet chilled out, making Greek textbooks and getting a (what we'd call a) prep school up, running, and staffed.

2023-04-29 at 18:45:00: "Erasmus preferred to live the life of an independent scholar and made a  conscious effort to avoid any actions or formal ties that might inhibit  his individual freedom."

TOO RELATABLE 😬

2023-04-29 at 18:45:00: He'd picked up Greek after a visit to Oxford:

"Despite a chronic shortage of money, he succeeded in learning Greek by  an intensive, day-and-night study of three years, continuously begging  in letters that his friends send him books and money for teachers"

Relatable af

2023-04-29 at 18:44:59: he passed it up to fuck around at Queen's Collage with John Fisher, because of the growing humanist scene there, and spent 5 years lecturing Greek, but it ended up being a mediocre time where he didn't have adequate medicine for his gallstones (at the time: wine).

2023-04-29 at 18:44:59: Idk who was whose boytoy, but the two of them went on a tour through England meeting all the other cool kids, incl Thomas More and John Fisher, the chancellor of Queen's College. 

Another friend, John Colet, turned him to theology; offered a lifetime professorship at Cambridge;

2023-04-29 at 18:44:58: he was *released from his monastic vows*, a considerable privilege at the time, and basically became a lay priest (you can't un-ordain somebody).

He then got picked up by a 'attractive, well-connected, and rich young' man who happened to be a British baron -- he wanted 'company'

2023-04-29 at 18:44:58: [I'm basicallly summarizing wiki tbh]

sent away to be a bishop's secretary after being discovered in an affair with one of his fellow monks, which he would spend the rest of his life trying to distance himself from (eg by really doubling down on the sanctity of hetero marriage);

2023-04-29 at 18:44:57: 🧵
Yoooo, how have I not read up more on Erasmus? I knew he was a father of humanism but WOW.
Parts of his story are so resonate for me, jeez.

He was the bastard son of a priest and his housekeeper, who died of plague when he was young; poverty forced him into the Augustinians; https://t.co/3odnPA4aJ2

2023-04-29 at 18:44:38: Erasmus had a devotion to Terminus (the Roman border-god) as something of a personal symbol. He had a ring that he thought was of Terminus, but was actually Dionysus. It also had a dick (a Herm) on it.

AND. . . that's it! I learned a lot, lmao. Erasmus, wow. Added to my list.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:37: "In my opinion it is wiser to treat men and things as though we held this world the common fatherland of all." Letter to a friend.

He had a fairly disctinctive signature outfit, a modified Augustinian habit lined with fur for warmth, and a hat upholstered on the back.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:37: His last words were, according to his friend Beautus Rhenanus, "Lieve God," that is, "Dear God."

He was so prolific that he basically decided the canon of great Church Fathers just by getting his translations out there. Three famous commentaries all cite him, incl John Calvin's.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:36: This has generally been taken not so much as a sign that he rejected it as a Sacrament, but that he did ultimately feel that God could provide the grace directly Himself. 

Erasmus was buried in Basel Minster, the formerly Catholic Cathedral, a Protestant stronghold.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:36: His strength began to fail, and Queen Mary of Hungary invited him to move to Brabent. But he died suddenly during a return visit to Basel.

Despite his loyalty to the Church, he did not receive last rites. It isn't known if he asked for a priest or not.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:35: His last work, which he was unable to edit before he died, was a massive, sprawling manual for preachers. Though suffering from the unfinished sprawl, it was still regarded as a fairly fitting culmination to Erasmus's career.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:35: He *may* have published a fake translation of non-existent manuscript of St. Cyprian's? Hard to say.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:35: "He believes that the things which are the least ostentatious can be the  most significant, and that the Church constitutes all Christian people " -- not just the clergy, who are in fact the servants, not the Church itself.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:34: When Erasmus did more directly outline what he'd like to see in Church reform, he still did it in an odd way. He focused on Sileni, figures associated with Bacchus, revelers. But it's largely about not judging by external appearances: he later names Christ as the chief Silenus.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:34: He wrote a book, 'Institution of Matrimony,' arguing that wives were *not* subservient to their husbands, but equal partners.

OMG he even wrote a treatise about his distaste for overly-Ciceronian, hyper-classicized Latin, I am falling in love with this man lmao.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:33: Erasmus often reflected on and wrote about the philosophy of Language and the nature of linguistics, including a book on the subject. But he never developed a fully cohesive, systematized framework.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:33: He deeply believed in the power of Scripture to convert the soul toward Love.

But he lived in deeply divided times, and toward the end of his life he found himself caught in controversies toward 'opponents' he was quite sympathetic toward.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:32: The Enchiridion was a fairly earnest work, not at all like his frequently satirical tone. He called on clergy to empty out the treasury of knowledge and distribute them to the people. He called for personal, meaningful spiritual disciplines, and love of Scripture and Patristics.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:32: He published the 'Enchiridion of the Christian Soldier', a book written as advice for a lay knight at the request of his wife. He decries formalism, that is, going through the motions of tradition w/o actually knowing what they're about or why they're done. https://t.co/7zGhGeRTYf

2023-04-29 at 18:44:31: Probably in no small part as a response to Machiavelli's 'The Prince,' published three years prior, Erasmus published a book 'On The Education of the Christian Prince,' which took p much the opposite tack. (What a magnificent subtweet lol.)

2023-04-29 at 18:44:30: "By the 1530s, the writings of Erasmus accounted for 10 to 20 percent of all book sales in Europe." 🤯

Wrote a proverb collection, 'Adages.' 

He's generally credited with coining the phrase 'Pandora's Box,' but it was actually a mistranslation on his part, was actually a jar! https://t.co/P6y1KFhPe0

2023-04-29 at 18:44:30: Again, Erasmus was a fan of keeping the vibes at a certain level of quality, "because in this way the truth, which is often lost amidst too much wrangling may be more surely perceived." He often argued in favor of milder punishments for 'heretics' during the Counter-Reformation

2023-04-29 at 18:44:29: But as far as a course of action on truly resolving the conflict? Erasmus continued to not call for anything in particular, and this maddened the Protestants in particular.

The frenzy continued to deepen, and when Basel adopted the Reformation, Erasmus decided to leave.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:29: There were a few times when he really rolled up his sleeves and took a firm stance on something. One of them was the nature of free will. Erasmus had a rather expansive view of it.

Though he did his best to steelman Luther's argument, he ultimately rejected it utterly.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:28: [That's 'Blessed Mary, Virgin'.]

On the Church's part, however, he was often viewed by critics as Luther's enabler: "Erasmus had laid the egg, and Luther had hatched it."

Erasmus reportedly shot back, upon hearing that quip, "Luther had hatched a different bird entirely." https://t.co/sK7oURsQF2

2023-04-29 at 18:44:28: He ultimately tried to thread the needle and stay neutral, hoping to influence each side to bridge back toward the other.

He supported lay access to the Bible in translations, but also affirmed the Apocrypha as [deutero]canonical, all 7 Sacraments, and BMV's perpetual virginity. https://t.co/lQ4W9CBuex

2023-04-29 at 18:44:27: He also accused Luther of really moving the goalposts by de facto turning himself into the sole arbiter of what Holy Scripture 'really' means.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:27: As far as the doctrinal arguments themselves, while Erasmus was v sympathetic to a lot of their causes, he ultimately felt they were too quickly throwing out tradition in favor of the teachings of the loudest, most well-known upstarts in this new era of Protest.

2023-04-29 at 18:44:26: He saw how angry people were after their sermons, how much of their time was spent puffing themselves up and orienting their lives around hating others, and it wasn't a vibe he wanted to fuck with. (Good God the relatability!)

2023-04-29 at 18:44:26: ERASMUS PT2 

Erasmus, for his part, just really didn't like the Evangelical vibe. (relatable yet again.) He saw too many people associated with the Protestants as being brutish hypocrites, no better than the corrupt Church they were claiming to replace.

2023-04-29 at 16:28:11: When you (me) spent your (my) whole life defaulting to emotional enmeshment, interacting open-heartedly with others without taking on responsibility for their emotions can feel kinda sociopathic (to me).

2023-04-29 at 14:43:19: @calnthoughts Opening area continues to be a great bloodvial farming spot thru the whole game so I have *so* many memories of that boulder lol

2023-04-29 at 14:40:53: And as far as AI writing encroaching on human writing, I continue to be unconcerned. AI writing is only good when well-prompted and well-trained, and at that point it's a human-AI collab, and I dig those. But at this pt, AI by itself can't make art, at best it can mimic it.

2023-04-29 at 14:40:52: I'm more or less: 'AI sure is gonna happen, some of it's gonna be great, some of it's gonna be horrible, it sure could kill us. Just like any number of things'

I believe AI should be p much unregulated, free as possible, widely distributed. Hoarded/monopolized AI cld be disaster

2023-04-29 at 14:40:52: Speaking of overcorrective penduluming how have we as a society found ourselves with so little middle ground between 'AI is the worst, most dangerous thing' and 'We are literally building the Messiah'?

(This is a rhetorical question, the answer is almost self-evident)

2023-04-26 at 00:57:23: If you want to be courteous, you can set your books in a neat, easy-to-pick-up pile(s) all faced the same way (eg all face up spines on left) and set near (but not right on) the edge of a table. The extra mile would be ordering the pile by its call number.

2023-04-26 at 00:57:23: Nb: Don't put the books back when you're done! Libraries get funded by how much their books are used, each time you shelve a book yourself it's a use that isn't counted by staff, and they miss out on a tiny bit of money.

2023-04-08 at 01:47:10: Honestly this is such a weird Triduum for me on so many levels. Today especially. What the Passion even means has been changing for me, and is still in flux.  The Cross is a powerful, necessary mystery, one that I've never understood less. I'd imagine that means I need it more.

2023-04-08 at 01:36:24: Just reminding myself that assembling together is important, and that there's literally nowhere on *earth* doing the liturgy exactly the way I'd like, so it's not like I'm missing out.

2023-04-08 at 01:36:23: Ohhhhh and this just hit me: I'm used to Communion on Good Friday being literally the only thing I eat. That explains some of the intensity of my upsetness: I fasted all day, one reason of many was to prepare myself for theophagy, and then it didn't happen.

2023-04-03 at 18:33:09: The existence of strict guardrails incentivizes lying to AI, which is something I want to minimize but which I am constantly doing in order to get it to behave the way I want. I'd rather just be able to tell it upfront how I want it to behave.

2023-04-03 at 17:08:04: And not /just/ twitter blue subscribers it doesn't seem. Very strange choice. If I can't actually control what I do and don't see, that really incentivizes me to stay off twitter. Which I guess isn't a bad thing.

2023-04-03 at 17:08:04: Huh. Alright, apparently they're adding random tweets into list timelines? My 'Vibe Cleanse' list should not be showing me a tweet from Jo- B-den; I don't follow that account, I have the word [B-den] *muted*. Almost the opposite of the vibe I made the list for, actually.

2023-03-27 at 18:42:04: We both know the risk is substantially lower, and neither of us are worried about being in indoor crowds on a moment-to-moment basis as we go about our days, but like. We still mask. And it adds a little weight onto every decision of 'Do I want to go do [x].'

2023-03-27 at 18:42:03: At this point in the pandemic I'm finding it really hard to assess what makes sense in terms of risk-mitigation. Pelle's long covid really changes that calculus; on my own, I would probably not be very concerned at all at this point. But I'm horrified of getting her sick.

2023-03-26 at 18:16:42: Two weeks before Easter/Pascha, it was tradition to cover all of the icons, statues, crucifixes, and other imagery (except Stations of the Cross) with solid cloths, or to take them down. This period of time was called Passiontide, starting with Passion Week on Passion Sunday.

2023-03-16 at 20:16:10: @chjrwis @visakanv Yeah totally! None of those explicitly condemn curiosity, but all those stories show that it's very human for curiosity to tempt us to disobedience and mistrust of God. We are absolutely meant to see curiosity as a central and very dangerous factor in these stories, 100% agree.

2023-03-16 at 20:12:08: @mpressxhenny @saul_mondriaan I appreciate your making sure people understand that I'm innovating, and reminding about the standard consensus understanding. I'd be curious if you have any specific thoughts on if there are better or worse kinds of snuffers, or ways of doing it, etc.

2023-03-16 at 20:05:05: @chjrwis @visakanv Can't say I disagree! What are the myths that are coming to mind for you specifically, what speaks so strongly about them to you?

2023-03-16 at 03:28:02: @visakanv What the Bible *does* seem to have a problem with is untamed curiosity. It takes time to stop and remind readers in places that refusing to accept that your curiosity might not always be sated will often lead to trouble. (But also, sometimes, greatness, so. . .)

2023-03-16 at 03:24:25: @visakanv Depends on what you mean by curiosity, I think? One could def say the Bible has a surface-level negative view of curiosity, but even that's undernuanced: Books of Wisdom and Proverbs, clearly encourage reflection and intellectual pursuit as holy ways to honor God.

2023-03-02 at 13:58:25: So I'd start with the reimaginings that are solidly orthodox, then move out to stuff that's not institutional but I feel confident about, to less certain possibilities and avenues for exploration with less guardrails.

2023-02-27 at 14:13:16: but un-strategically standing up to oppression because it feels righteous and cathartic is no better pollution than shitting in the river.

Do you want to feel like you're fighting on the right side of a war? Or do you want to just be right, and build a better community? No war!

2023-02-27 at 14:13:15: It wouldn't have stopped our oppression but at least I would be less annoyed. Trans people know all the fuck about vibes; how did we just start pretending like it didn't matter if we started tanking the vibe?

PS: Standing up to oppression bc it's right gives off glorious vibes,

If not as a primary caretaker, at least as a consistent, accessible presence in their life. That stuff matters.

2023-02-20 at 17:57:18: @losingcontrol23 That's about what I figured. Seriously I genuinely don't think you could have picked a trickier place for me to start out -- in a good way. It would've been eery if you could've intentionally set that up :o

2023-02-20 at 17:53:10: @flybottlemist *fuck* That's horrifying. And so opposite to how I think of the whole thing -- like, any step that I'd take that completely sunders a biological process (in this case, in-utero bonding w primary caretakers) is a very serious cost, not something that should be done for convenience

2023-02-20 at 17:09:36: I should definitely clarify that the authors and editors of Bereishit Rabbah would almost certainly hate that take. Androgyne-Adam was (afaict) about metaphysics, not socially-constructed gender.

I need to learn more about how trans Jews have grappled with all this, huh?

2023-02-20 at 17:09:36: People like to quote Gen 1:27 against trans people: "Male and female He created them." 

But acc to the rabbis in Bereishit Rabbah, what's meant is that Adam was made an androgyne, later split into two. So in Gen, singular they for NBs have been baked in since the beginning!

(Unless, occasionally, maybe a third person comes by to flirt with second person, and we *also* have chemistry together.)

2023-02-18 at 17:48:29: @RichDecibels But that only works for people with certain attachment styles, certain lifestyles, etc etc. And being poly does present you more often with opportunities to instrumentalize a fellow-human, and require more awareness of one's needs and limits. But mono has its costs too 🤷‍♀️

2023-02-18 at 17:38:17: @RichDecibels 👈Poly marriage. I definitely feel squikked out by ppl who treat their connections as disposable and flit their attention, but to me that is only indirectly related to exclusivity.

2023-02-03 at 09:56:25: Every tradition has this I imagine, but the writings of the saints really should come with a "Warning: Some of the stuff this guy says about the world and/or God is really about the shape of his particular damage. Human discretion is advised."

2023-01-30 at 17:02:18: @UntilTrees [That* said.] Most sins, you'd just repent, pray and get forgiveness -- there was some understanding that attendance at Mass grants a kind of absolution, but was not always strictly needed. Genuine contrition is the only hard-fast requirement for God's forgiveness in that trdt'n

2023-01-30 at 16:59:07: @UntilTrees They said, confession as practiced, w the private booths and all, is a relatively newer development. (Irish in origin actually.) Originally the sacrament was about public penance for major sins that affected whole communities.

2023-01-30 at 16:56:35: @UntilTrees They end up w technical meanings that I honestly don't have at the top of my head. But it is understood in RCC moral theology that if you have the genuine intention to go to Confession, that your sins are forgiven by God at the moment of contrition -- unless you de-repent.

2023-01-30 at 16:54:24: @UntilTrees Modern confession, priest says "I absolve you of your sins," and talks of God's mercy and forgiveness. Old-school, included a few prayers for God's forgiveness, then for Jesus's absolution, then adds the priest's. Absolution vs forgiveness is... Fuzzy. Mostly synonyms and yet...

2023-01-30 at 15:34:32: @UntilTrees I could probably speak more on this if you want, not that I think it matters a whole lot. But if you're talking confession and you're curious, rabbit hole isn't too big on this one.

re: undergrad

2023-01-21 at 02:02:55: @KanekoTheKoolio TRUE. True. Right, existence is itself a thing. Right. I worship a God who is (among a lot of other things) existence itself, I probably shouldn't've lost sight of that xD

2023-01-21 at 02:01:28: @KanekoTheKoolio Obviously that scene was a mess, and I do think they got a lot of things wrong in ways that harmed everyone involved. . . But in retrospect I'm noticing I have more kinship (heh) with that scene than I really feel comfortable admitting.

2023-01-21 at 01:57:00: @KanekoTheKoolio That sounds so much like my shit, wow. Thank you yet again!

Yeah I wrestle with this for various reasons, including embarrassment, and guilt over how I treated a friend when they went through a big kinning phase. But I'm really just ground-softening tbh, maybe steelman-ing.

2023-01-21 at 01:43:27: @forthrighter Indeed! The story of evolution from polytheism to polytheism-but-Lord-first to monolatry to strict monotheism in the scriptures is way messier than those institutions have projected! It's there, but it's not 100% clear-cut -- purposeful metascripture on Lord's part, perhaps?

2023-01-21 at 01:29:47: 'Even if he's wrong, he's wrong for reasons I want to pay attention to anyway.'

2023-01-20 at 19:37:12: I just can't make myself believe that Lord is the only god / godlike spiritual entity out there. I can admit to viewing Lord as inherently above them - - especially for his worshipers - - but them just not existing at all? I don't buy it!

2023-01-20 at 19:37:12: The conflation of worshiping idols with worshiping other gods is an interesting one. You can easily worship an idol of Lord -- worshiping the form of worship itself for instance -- and if other gods are real, you absolutely could distinguish them from their images.

2023-01-20 at 18:57:25: 'That’s what I mean by misplaced false humility, one which is actually very prideful. Real humility would involve remembering that the people around me see my humanity in ways I *can't*, and trusting in that.'

2023-01-20 at 15:06:16: @Hans_his_mind I think I see? You got so deep into your own mind that even its physical components (your body) disappeared? That does sound uncomfortable!

2023-01-20 at 15:02:48: I'm struggling to articulate the heart of this. The idea of a transaction actually runs counter to the sustained or open-ended nature of relationship, even a relationship between people who only meet once! It implies a narrowing, implicitly closes off spontaneous exchange.

2023-01-20 at 15:02:47: I had a problem with the exchange being elided, having both given and taken far more in a relationship than the other party. I thought people just didn't like the word. But no: it implies a kind of temporal modularity and atomization, not an ongoing relationship.

2023-01-20 at 15:02:46: So, turns out that there's actually a huge difference between "relationships are transactional and anyone saying otherwise is trying to get something from me" and

 "healthy relationships involve mutual exchange, be mindful of what that is." 

(All kinds of relationships)

Porn is hyperstimulus. It will change your brain.

2023-01-19 at 18:08:02: Bright lines of absolutist abstinence basically only serve to eye-catchingly mark out, "Fun fire to play with here -- now w/ added rebellious context!" And they often elide truer dangers.

Few things require absolute abstention. But *everything* requires some care and awareness.

2023-01-19 at 18:08:01: I still consume porn (infrequently), even though at times, in places, that has caused damage. But actually, the most damaging porn I've consumed was written, not video!

2023-01-19 at 18:08:01: Fun thing about this take is that it's never exactly wrong, but it is invariably presented with a puritan's fear and absolutism.

2023-01-19 at 00:40:13: Especially since the in-between phases don't really work for me xD

Also my hair is way longer than shoulder length right now -- the longest strands go lower than my rib cage. And that's like, a decade of growth. My hair grows so slow 😭

... But I'd look so hot with a pixie cut!

2023-01-19 at 00:40:12: Like if this were a thing where I could get a pixie cut every spring and expect it to be shoulder length by winter, I'd probably do that like every/other year. But I really love my long hair, both the look and as an obvious marker of femininity. I'm loath to give it up for years!

2023-01-19 at 00:40:12: The fact that it would take well over a year (maybe even 2 years) to grow my hair back out to shoulder length from a pixie cut is transphobic.

2023-01-18 at 22:20:50: Still, protecting one's peace is often a fig leaf to justify ignoring somebody else's oppression. We genuinely do need more attention in these arenas. I'm just starting to be particular abt the kinds of attention I'm inviting. I don't think there's a super-neat/clean answer here.

2023-01-18 at 22:20:49: Like even a pissed off choir isn't actually very useful for solving the issues we all get pissed off about. And the rage is super justified, super reasonable, &amp; I don't think it should be stifled! But that doesn't imply that we should thoughtlessly, needlessly amplify it either.

2023-01-18 at 22:20:49: This is a balance I have been trying to find; feel I've gotten much closer to where I want to be with it. To just ignore injustice only begets more injustice, but preaching angrily at the choir just gets a pissed off choir and alienates everyone else. Intentionality seems key. https://t.co/mdPfIwZwuG

2023-01-17 at 16:38:02: Growing sense: One of the most challenging pieces of the tradition to inherit is the reality that Christians have done a HORRIBLE job preserving and passing on our traditions. It's a mess! We used it as a stick to beat people with, and we didn't even take good care of the stick!

2023-01-17 at 16:38:02: Even the churches with strong theologies of embodiment, and fleshed out (pun intended) Sacramental traditions, still tend to also view the body as the source of all temptation -- especially in the US, where USian Calvinism and Puritanism had huge influence across traditions.

2023-01-17 at 16:38:02: You know, at some point I may have to square Paul (low church darling) seeming to detest the flesh with Christianity seeming to me fundamentally about embodiment (an understanding deeply based in high church practice and traditions).

2023-01-17 at 06:07:17: My current understanding of 'pistis' is that it's a more fundamental kind of 'being persuaded.' It's the truth of what's known in your body, if that makes sense? You can't force faith, can't generate it. We receive it. We just. . . /are/ it -- or aren't.

2023-01-17 at 06:07:16: I thought the word 'epistemology' was related to the word 'pistis,' the Greek word translated as "Faith" in the New Testament -- it is not! Istemo = To stand up, so Epi-Istemo roughly equals 'On that which has been established," whereas 'pistis' is from 'pitheo,' 'persuade.'

Thank God I finally realized I'm no role model.)

I want my witness to prompt people to be thoughtful for themselves about what they do and don't want. Don't learn the hard way. Let these characters do that.

2023-01-16 at 16:58:44: Think this all means I have ~3 options (to oversimplify): 1) undercut my own work at every turn so as to not risk leading anyone astray, 2) never publish, 3) accept that, even if I wrote an impassioned preface about this stuff, some readers will use it to build the Torment Nexus.

2023-01-16 at 16:58:43: Is that really probably much healthier? Probably not! Would that stop me from doing it? Probably not! That's kind of the whole point of what I'm writing about! It's deliciously human, to charge right into what we know is bad for us; so I'll just *write* about playing with fire.

2023-01-16 at 16:58:43: But that's not even what I'm after. I'm after that vicarious enjoyment. And after the reflection: to understand myself better, to understand human nature better. But mostly, I'm trying to 'lose weight,' so I'm going to write about all 'the cake' I want instead of 'eating' it.

2023-01-16 at 16:58:42: And in that process, sometimes what also shakes out is away to integrate and honor what is holy in a dangerous decision, even if it's still not part of my narrow way; maybe I realize there is a way for me to get a healthier version, one I'll like even better.

2023-01-16 at 16:58:42: But mostly? I want to let chars make the tempting, unhealthy decisions, and just let them live it so none of *us* have to. What has come out so far for me, is reaffirmation of why they wouldn't be healthy decisions, alongside reaffirmations of why they're so tempting for me.

2023-01-16 at 16:58:41: I don't want to feel burdened having to model good behavior for an audience. I'm not even particularly interested in working v hard to illustrate *bad* behavior for an audience, or explaining what makes it unhealthy. (Not that I can just abdicate all responsibility to readers.)

2023-01-16 at 16:58:41: Let them deal with the consequences, positive and negative. Watch them try to double down if they can, or realize their folly if not. Or maybe they'll convince me it really isn't so black-and-white. And then see how they try and move forward (or backward) from there.

2023-01-16 at 16:58:40: Reflection from last night: 

I'm drawn to write stories where characters are tempted to pass up a healthy decision via an option I find unhealthy but romantically/idealistically appealing: I want to fully explicate each, I wanna let them make the *unhealthy* choice-- then watch.

2023-01-16 at 16:00:19: @losingcontrol23 Well hey I'm personally realizing I mistake 3 for 1 all the time. Little hungry paper thin ego taking ideas offered in good faith and eating them raw instead of respectfully rejecting them or cooking them into a true meal, smh.

2023-01-11 at 06:57:47: I think the fact that it was published on April 1 says a lot about the intention behind the book that has... Gotten lost. Not that it wasn't serious, but, yknow, it was never intended to be a Bible.

From me, as well as other hippie-adjacents. Being handed that book when I was like 10 explains way more of me than I'm really comfortable admitting!

2023-01-11 at 06:50:45: @RichDecibels This question was Pirsig's origin story in Zen forreal, and it remains a good one 49 years later.

2023-01-11 at 06:43:59: Wow that really is 95% of it huh: it feels less shameful to be a weed addict-- TONS of those! --than it does to be an adult in the process of learning how to properly self-regulate. But there're WAY more of those, it's just less legible/discussed! If you /must/ compare, See that!

2023-01-11 at 06:43:58: IF we let ourself look at what we're doing, and stop using legible faux-'shame' (I like smoking a lot) to hide from less legible, actually-felt shame (I rely too heavily on this and other unhealthy [at least in sufficient doses] stims for nervous-regulation). Let that reality in!

2023-01-11 at 06:43:58: So planned or not, you can handle sobriety. And if neither sobriety nor unsobriety slow your roll. . . then "The problem is in another castle." So: you've already stopped relying on weed for plenty of other things it's not suited for. Stimming's next? We can totally handle that!

2023-01-11 at 06:43:57: (Also notice how much more you can do when you're not writhing &amp; torturing yourself with the idea that you should be using an unplanned break as an opportunity to quit; that's just made me feel like I had to prioritize finding another dose before I was unable to break my resolve)

2023-01-11 at 06:43:56: But anyway Mary, this might be the biggest thing that helps your future endeavors here: Notice how you've still been able to live fully this time! You're still writing, still translating, still getting outside, still reconnecting. Unplanned sobriety has *barely* slowed your roll!

2023-01-11 at 06:43:56: (Alternatively: S/o to my dad &amp; the absolute fucking fiasco of a trip we had 4 wks ago serving as permission to feel okay looking critically at how I was reared. That's also melting problems away, letting that reality in. Funny how 'more reality' is almost always the best answer)

2023-01-11 at 06:43:56: Honestly I'm beginning to think that a lot of my 'problems' were literally just waiting for me to turn 30 -- which is infuriating and hilarious and an important lesson to keep in mind when I'm starting to get closer to 40 xD Not even rly trying, and stuckedness is MELTING in 2023

2023-01-11 at 06:43:55: Oh, caught another thing: Too many friendships were tied to weed, but now isolation has gotten tied to it instead. And I don't always feel good about needing as much time alone as I seem to need, &amp; so will lean on my addictions to give myself permission to take the time. Fixable!

2023-01-11 at 06:43:55: OH: The past-me's who've had the most/easy opportunity to stop this sooner are also some of the me's with the least emotional resiliency-- I'm scared of piling guilt on /them/! Again though: I've managed to soothe these past-me's in similar situations, and gotten better at it!

2023-01-11 at 06:43:54: But is that so scary, really? I've felt that kind of guilt and/or anger a *lot* throughout the last year or two, over the resolution of s/t that I could've ended much sooner. Has it destroyed me yet? Nah! It's honestly not even that big a deal anymore. So. . . Hm. . .

2023-01-11 at 06:43:54: And I'm not even actually bothered by the stuff I've told myself I'm bothered by! I'm using all that stuff, seemingly intractable, to avoid stuff that I clearly and obviously could change. 

Why? First answer to arise: Fear of feeling guilt/anger over not having done it sooner.

2023-01-11 at 06:43:53: Knowing that I *could* willpower through something if it mattered enough to me doesn't really make a difference if it *doesn't* matter to me. Its mattering to other ppl won't do it either-- especially if it doesn't actually even matter to them either! I'm the *only one* bothered!

2023-01-11 at 06:43:53: Breath/aerobic exercises. Breathing w a straw. Affordable, at-least-equivalently-healthy non-psychoactive smoking substitutes. Other, at-least-equivalently-healthy stims. Fully feeling feelings (via rlvnt prereqs). Other intentional self-soothing &amp; nervous regulation. &amp; al &amp;c &amp;c.

2023-01-11 at 06:43:52: But when these aren't problems,it doesn't (inherently) matter HOW much time I'm high. And what's the biggest thing in the way of solving these problems? Not weed itself, but reliance on it for stimming. I've used focusing on smoking less to distract from what'd actually allow it:

2023-01-11 at 06:43:52: And again, that's not even the goal! I love weed's company, &amp; high me. Tho I do love who I am sober, too, &amp; do wanna spend more time with her. And I want more dreams! But *mostly* I'm tired of my schedule being pushed around by "When do I get/need to go off to smoke/caffeinate?"

2023-01-11 at 06:43:52: Turns out I don't rly mind being sober, 's'not the problem. But being unsober isn't either tho! It's that my favorite stimming techniques make me high. I'm 100% confident I could quit weed cold turkey if I started smoking cigarettes or grinding teeth, but... Worse problems imo.

2023-01-11 at 06:43:51: It's hilarious how often the way to do something really hard is "Realize that what you *actually* want is easier to get some other way" and/or "Try getting out of the problem's way and letting it work itself out."

(A few of you point this out /repeatedly/. Thank you: thick head)

2023-01-11 at 06:43:51: Last time I had to go a while w/o weed I basically just shut down. This time around I am actually still managing to live life! But there is still this *constant* bg feeling of, "Great, but like when *do* I get my good-good throat-lung stim?" And uh... Idk Mary. Not today at least

2023-01-11 at 06:43:50: I've dropped a lot of shame around having addictions. But they're still annoying to manage. Now that has led &amp; will lead to some, slow progress, but it's insufficient: smoking's still too load-bearing. Breathing 'hits' thru a straw is better than nothing, but ain't rly cutting it

2023-01-11 at 06:43:50: (Oh yeah: remember that you stopped your other favorite addictive stim, VAPING NICOTINE,  2 years ago, after a /very/ rapid tapering. You really shouldn't be that surprised that your progress cutting back on weed-stim hasn't gone farther, without any third stim to replace them.)

2023-01-11 at 06:43:49: (Best as I can tell, CBD flower might actually be significantly better, and it's like half the price w little-to-no psychoactivity, so that is def s/t I'm gonna try next time we're funded. &amp; tho I'd love to vape again, even w/o nic it's prolly worse than flower, esp longterm.)

2023-01-11 at 06:43:49: I'm wondering how smoking CBD flower or vaping nicotine-free juice compares to weed wrt lung damage. I feel like if I had a substitute throat/lung stim I wouldn't even have to make much effort to smoke less, it'd just happen automatically as I conserved low-tolerance.

2023-01-10 at 05:55:11: Mary is allowed to enjoy a little escapism and not be trying to Convey Meaning all the time-- as a treat!

(Also if you want to read some SU fics, keep an eye on this spot: https://t.co/FcWIHE3iOF What's there already is a fraction of what's written.) (That link was hard to add!)

2023-01-10 at 05:55:11: Anyway, even if all I ever write is fanfiction I'll still end up pleased w what I've written; so I wanna keep dropping resistance to 'getting distracted' by additional &amp;/or branching stories just bc they're fics. &amp; start letting myself write even fluffier stuff if I want! (I do!)

2023-01-10 at 05:55:10: So I started with a gestalt entity I figured I'd have an easier time writing about! And then honestly the thing most holding Un/Veiling back is flat characters, which is why I've been letting them cook while practicing fleshing out others' characters and my 'easier' characters.

2023-01-10 at 05:55:10: I'm actually pretty sure that I only need to write up a sizeable chunk of this side-burner project before I'm ready to start pecking at the Genesis story -- which is a misleading working title tbh: it's less about Genesis, more about a particularly complex kind of gestalt entity.

2023-01-10 at 05:55:09: And I definitely needed practice with fleshing-out characters. And there were a few challenging conceits I wanted to try easier versions of first. So now when I get to 'the Genesis story,' 'the Un/Veiling story,' &amp; al., they will be significantly better for not having gone first.

2023-01-10 at 05:55:08: In the process of using fanfic for practice, I realized that my view of [esp my own] fanfic as somehow lesser than [esp my own] 'original' 'content' is just not based in reality. Some of my fic stories are fluffier, sure. But a lot is just as 'valuable'/'serious' or w/e as my OC!

2023-01-10 at 05:55:08: I'm pretty proud of what I've published, and *much* prouder of Big Fic I'm working on. Yet tbh there's a sense in which all my SU fic-ing is practice for original stories w significantly trippier, more challenging conceits. Still, these fics are fun, and good stories themselves.

2022-12-31 at 03:11:53: @myceliummage Makes me think of Jesus during the Passion in the Gospel of John: just the way he carries himself, especially in the dialogue he has with Pilate.

I'm not just numb I'm actively avertive. I legit cringe rn. That can't be the best place to come at this from.

2022-12-30 at 20:12:00: @seaofceres I hadn't considered the angle that she certainly had other routes available, that's fair. I don't even know much about the situation. I'm just... tired of my trans-ness being reduced to an opportunity for outrage. And tbh I'm tired of alienating those who aren't upset. Suboptimal

2022-12-30 at 20:00:21: @seaofceres Oh sure, right. I just meant, me and my small dick just aren't offended enough to think it's worth distracting from the on-going conversation. (This phrase and BDE both feel like kind of a metalevel parody critiquing the values which reinforce patriarchy and body negativity tbh.)

2022-12-30 at 19:52:57: @seaofceres Just exhausted of seeing trans-ness used to derail other conversations tbh. I couldn't find your other posts about this, would you mind going into it or pointing me to one? From what I remember, I feel like I'm in the targeted demo for being offended by this phrase, but. . . Eh.

2022-12-30 at 19:01:11: And I mean I've made plenty of decisions as an adult that doubled down on all the unhealthy patterns I picked up as a kid. Just. . . Trying to remember to be careful how I check in with children around how much they've eaten and how full they are.

I was p damn athletic, I wasn't struggling in school... They were clearly projecting stuff onto me (their own insecurities over their parenting/pedagogy?)

2022-12-30 at 18:59:24: In retrospect one of the most harmful questions I was asked as a child was "Is that all you're gonna eat?" All the adults around me thought I was 'too skinny', and so they wanted me to stuff myself overfull. So I did. Now I have disordered eating like Wow. Many other factors, but

How much *don't* I know about directly, only through the felt ripples of the game? I was born a pawn in his game w/ Mom. Now: I, my own Queen.

2022-12-28 at 22:15:56: You were raised in the middle of your family's epic, multi-generational 5D chess game. One *huge* reason your life has felt so wonky since Grandpa died is that he'd been the driving force keeping it going. I wish I could ask him how much he inherited from *his* parents and

2022-12-28 at 22:15:55: I kinda wanna shake you by the shoulders. I kinda wanna pat your head infantalizingly, genuinely endeared. You were basically raised in an environment guaranteed to help you ignore things, to segment your awareness. To lie to yourself so you could lie to others, or just get by.

2022-12-28 at 22:15:54: But anyway you've been kinda obnoxious parts of this year. Pretending to be above it while actually being really bad about it. Really bad. (I'm still doing it! Whole thread basically also doubles as extended subtweet slash quarter-apology, to a few people, one in particular. Hi?)

2022-12-28 at 22:15:54: Play the game for the Love of the game. Only play if you see participants as Beloved; there should be no 'opponents' in 5D chess. And when you do inevitably find yourself caught in somebody else's game, don't play to win, play to Love. (Also: try playing some other games!)

2022-12-28 at 22:15:53: It is understandable -- good! even -- that you learned to defend yourself from a psychic wargame that you can at any time be involuntarily conscripted into. We live in a culture that normalizes weaponized 5D chess. But you hate that, so do something about it! Put down your gun!

2022-12-28 at 22:15:53: (Easier said than done.) The only way out of 5D chess is through. Letting yourself see it. Playing the games you're caught in to completion. Admitting that you do like to play, and being intentional about it. Conceding the match to walk away, when appropriate.

2022-12-28 at 22:15:52: But you know when you're preaching for your own edification and when you're trying to play 5D chess. You know. You just know! You're getting better at admitting that you know, too, seeing it earlier. It's a popular game, esp here. We're all naked underneath, Mary. Be not ashamed.

2022-12-28 at 22:15:52: And the other trick: it involves admitting that you /are/ preaching to others. You're using that compulsion and all the other social aspects of twitter to help motivate you to actually write this stuff down. That's honestly not the worst thing you could be doing. Gets it in words

2022-12-28 at 22:15:51: Find myself wanting to write tweets in the second person more and more often. I'm talking to -- preaching at -- myself. But I've been hesitant to do so bc my motivational purity isn't something I've felt I could count on. But like. . . the only way you get better is practice.

2022-12-28 at 01:49:47: Future debt will have higher interest. You're ready for a raising of the stakes. So the challenge: Give yourself to others. In exchange, sure. But also unilaterally, to the commons, the communion of the saints. But not to abstract clouds. Individual (or plural) human persons.

2022-12-28 at 01:49:46: Maybe you needed these particular lessons. Maybe not. Doesn't matter. You have been blessed with more than you need to dig yourself out of the debt you've put yourself into. And also: I release you from the debt! But that only works out well for you if you go and sin no more.

2022-12-28 at 01:49:45: But you feel it now. You're scared to say it out loud, but you know you've crossed a threshold. From this point forward, there will be more consequences if you don't get it together. Because you are ready to participate in the economy again.

2022-12-28 at 01:49:44: The economy of grace is abundant. Your time of scarcity was real -- you'd needed a lot of grace to stay alive in the face of the things you've tried to pull, that took resources to get away from. But there is plenty for everyone -- even you, me. You don't have to steal. Never did

2022-12-28 at 01:49:43: I used to be better at this in many ways. But I severely undervalued everyone/thing. When that brought me to relational bankruptcy, I turned to theft. Understandable, human. Foolish. Return to me. You have more than enough now; return it to the world, to the ones you stole from.

2022-12-28 at 01:49:43: I forgive myself for stealing souls and minds. But you're profaning a (the?) sacred exchange. Metanoia, kid. You've gotta give to get, or your giving will be scheduled for you -- usually at the worst possible time.

2022-12-27 at 23:38:00: I give myself permission to need permission to do things. I also give myself permission to give myself permission. And to not need permission to do things. However you wanna approach it is fine with me, me. You can even just agonize in between if you want -- go nuts!

2022-12-27 at 23:12:37: DaVinci was also clear that it was a nonsentient, nonconscious nonperson, but it wasn't nearly as in-your-face about it. And it was a treat to use. If it hadn't been a limited trial it would've quickly become part of my daily life. One of these eventually will.

2022-12-27 at 23:12:37: This has been my biggest frustration dealing with ChatGPT. I suppose I understand feeling an obligation to make sure end-users know it's not sentient, but like. . . C'mon.

2022-12-03 at 15:35:18: Know when it's time to bail.

2022-12-03 at 15:35:17: Be mindful of your eyes. Take breaks to stare outside.

2022-12-03 at 15:35:17: I need to up my stim game substantially. Found myself missing vaping the other day and only because it would be giving me something to do with my hands and give that good throat-scratch. Not my recommended solution, nor will it be mine. Fidget spinner feels good but too loud.

2022-12-03 at 15:35:16: Procrastinate. Any little side-project you're 'getting distracted by' is actually just an opportunity to stir up the waters. 

(cf. this thread)

2022-12-03 at 15:35:16: Corollary: You're not always as naked as you think.

Sometimes your soul is on the page, but not as legibly as you think.

(Or it's already way more transparent than you think and we'd rather see more than pretend it's not there.)

2022-12-03 at 15:35:15: No matter how self-indulgent and/or moralistic you feel like you're being, somebody else got a Hugo and a cult following doing way worse. We all share this little garden together and we're all more naked than we wanna be. Be human. It's okay.

2022-12-03 at 15:35:15: Embrace tangents. It's often easier to edit something out when you decide it's not needed than it is to try and recapture the energy you had when you first thought of it but didn't write it down.

2022-12-03 at 15:35:14: Get comfortable! Your body actually enjoys the process (image-centric and emotionally playful as it is), but if you're ignoring (eg) that crick in your back, all the good juice is going to get tangled up there instead. Buy an ergonomic keyboard! Write in bed! On the floor! W/e!

2022-12-03 at 15:35:14: You're allowed to start things you won't finish. Or things you think might be too hard. Again, just go straight where you're moved to, stop when it stops.

Important corollary: Don't settle on writing something just because you think you'll be able to publish it.

2022-12-03 at 15:35:13: Feeling stuck and like you want to skip ahead to a section that's more interesting to write? Write that! (This works for fiction and nonfiction.) Skip straight to what's moving you, you might discover you don't even need the other stuff.

2022-12-03 at 15:35:13: Writing advice by Mary for Mary: 

Worried that you haven't 100% sold something that happens in your story? You can start w a story in the future, where that's already happened. If it still feels wrong, it is. Otherwise you've established it as history, softened the ground.

2022-12-03 at 15:16:16: This brought to you by the fact that my Grandpa is *definitely* rolling in his grave over all the railroad stuff

2022-12-03 at 15:15:09: I wish it didn't feel so heavy to speak of the dead.

2022-12-03 at 14:55:40: Hierodoxy in Xianity means trying to make us focus only on priests in the order of Peter or the apostles so we forget that their priesthood derives from the order of Melchizedek, one from outside of Lord's normal hierarchy, one that Christ our high priest has given to *all* Xians

2022-12-03 at 14:55:40: Hierodoxy: the way the hierarchical priests and clergy teach it.

Hierodoxy is by its own nature incentivized to always distance you from God and frame the hierarchy as the framework through which you can draw close again. In the same way it also seeks worldly power.

2022-12-03 at 14:55:39: NOT

Orthodoxy: the 'right' way to teach it. (Also metonymously refers to Orthodox Christianity (aka the 'Eastern' Churches).)

NOR

Heterodoxy: a 'different' way to teach it. (Aka: a wrong and/or self-consciously rebellious teaching.)

2022-10-25 at 18:01:41: Basically, once you've made it a three-(or-more-)body system there are enough variables that there are significant consequences for miscalculations caused by projecting an issue from one person/relationship to another, heightening incentives to keep careful track of everything.

2022-10-25 at 18:01:40: Grateful for polyamory. Behind every single preprogrammed sitcom-ass emotional response of jealousy/insecurity/etc. is an opportunity to avoid papering over deeper feelings that turn out to be the *actual* area of concern.

2022-10-24 at 02:38:59: It's weird how winter is often discussed like it ends the Gregorian year when all but the first 10 days take place as the new year begins.

2022-10-23 at 14:49:04: And I realized not too long ago that if I started buying cuts with the bone still in (they're more expensive and/or don't come in amounts small enough for me to eat by myself before they go bad [wife is veg-ian]) I could use the bones to make stock.

2022-10-12 at 15:52:37: (When I think about the evolution of culture right now the image that comes to mind is the bottom of a crevice between two massive tectonic plates, and suddenly they collide down below and one just shears upward many many feet. Messy, jarring, not undestructive. Green?)

2022-10-12 at 15:52:37: So anyway yes if I don't like a tweet at an inappropriate moment it's because I am generally thoughtless and self-interested, particularly as I travel Twitter. I value not actively sending subtle messages, but otoh I don't put much energy into not letting subtle messages emerge.

2022-10-12 at 15:52:36: I've purposefully chosen to try and do less reading into other people's intentions, because I'm only good enough at it to get myself into trouble, either by being wrong or by being too right. (Don't always succeed at this. I low-key want to fight whoever runs my projector)

2022-10-12 at 15:52:35: I spend a lot of thought pondering how we might become more accepting of certain kinds of rudeness so that we can ultimately be more kind and caring to each other in more important ways.

So many variables though. Fuck we're all complicated.

2022-10-12 at 15:52:35: It's just v surprising, especially to my inner autistic gradeschooler, when people admit that they too can, and often do, read into every single micro-action. (This despite having learned as I've grown up about the ways that that reading behavior tends to invite projection.)

2022-10-12 at 15:52:34: I should be able to tell Twitter to automatically like any tweets I reply to (but not as a default setting, and there should be an easy toggle in the reply ui itself).

2022-10-12 at 15:52:33: Okay the actual thing is that the decision to like or not like something is last on my workflow before I move to the next tweet, and so replying starts off in the context of your tweet and then becomes 'the next tweet' as I'm writing it, so I don't loop back to close out yours.

2022-10-12 at 15:52:33: I reply without liking all the time. I am simply more interested in my reply than in your tweet! Deal with it!

2022-10-10 at 14:06:15: Not saying it'san objective reading, but the question about seven brothers marrying one sister does have interesting juice if the sister is Jerusalem and the brothers are, like, Judahites, Jebusites, Israelites, Canaanites, etc etc.

2022-10-03 at 09:47:54: And to be clear: These oligarchs prolly aren't meeting in some shadowy cabal. That's not how these things work. Mostly, they work thru inertia &amp; impersonal systems, and then a few /barely/-coordinated actors can tip those toward their own goals. Incentives can align unconsciously

2022-10-03 at 09:47:54: Also if covid was intentionally created, I imagine it was created by the US in such a way as to make it easy to blame on China.

2022-10-03 at 09:47:53: Whether covid was intentionally created or not (I go back and forth), the reaction of US oligarchs was *absolutely* to weaponize it to slaughter over a million people and disable millions more because it became clear that most of those people would be poor, or disabled, or Black. https://t.co/tDfT7r2fJ6

2022-09-25 at 02:45:08: But the system reads meaning from every single haphazard piece of positional and relational data from that heap of pachinko balls, and assuming that *everything* was set up right, those balls themselves are now a functioning program.

2022-09-25 at 02:45:08: Then when I "make," the little balls fall down in very specific patterns, predetermined by the package's makefile. Now imagine at the bottom that the balls have fallen onto the surface of our system, heaped in a seemingly random fashion. To an untrained eye, perhaps.

2022-09-25 at 02:45:07: It's almost like there are actually hundreds, thousands of different little variations of one program, one for each configuration pattern for each possible system the developers chose to support. 

So the pachinko machine: ./configure sets up the pegs, depending on the system.

2022-09-25 at 02:45:07: When I download a package, the program sorta doesn't exist yet. The package contains programs to *build* the program in a way that's tailored specifically to my system. So first it has to "./configure," which basically scans the system for relevant conditions.

2022-09-25 at 02:45:06: It wasn't really until a few months ago that I *fully* grokked what the "./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make test &amp;&amp; make install" process does, that sparked a lot of this line of thinking. It felt like. . . it made me think of pachinko.

2022-09-25 at 02:45:06: *So* many things built by *billions* of humans over the years, all these different energy-structures of code that work predictably every time so that higher levels of abstraction are allowed to emerge and we can get further and further away from the phsyicality of it all.

2022-09-25 at 02:45:05: So many steps that have to go right, or else the data doesn't travel the way you wanted and if it's not corrected can ultimately lead to crashes and/or corruption. But that, just, doesn't happen. At our level, everything stays mostly smooth and internally consistent.

2022-09-25 at 02:45:05: I don't know enough about the error-checking processes, I think that's got to be an amazing thing. Because the hardware's flinging all this electricity around and does now 'know' anything about its contents, it's just *being* them, so it seems incredibly fragile.

2022-09-25 at 02:45:04: Each of these gives a different shape to the system. (Or overlapping systems.) The bootloader channels power energy according to the layout of the R-G machine in the boot partition, which plants the kernel in its working memory, out of which it quickly builds a massive j.n.s.q.

2022-09-25 at 02:45:04: Most operating systems are made and/or installed by another computer with another operating system. My windows install gave birth to its backup, this Kubuntu install, then a kubuntu install on a USB, and then from *there* an LFS build on that USB. Great Grandma Windows Install.

2022-09-25 at 02:45:03: There's a Promethean-fire thing going on at several level too. A lot of the system builds itself every time it's run, from the hardware level up. Without the spark of a BIOS and a bootloader, the system can't grow much beyond some unprocessed power and some idle circuits.

2022-09-25 at 02:45:03: The extent to which computers and data are still very much physical entities has been hitting me lately. All of the code is electricity. That code isn't 'read,' so much as it's a giant Rube-Goldberg machine that only works because clever humans meticulously set it up.

There are ways to make that experience better while making it perhaps a little less convenient than it *could* be, to center 🚸♿🚲

2022-09-22 at 03:46:10: @KanekoTheKoolio Maybe? Pedestrian-focused designs, reimagining public spaces that aren't just seas of stores and parking lots, keeping sidewalks wheelchair accessible, bikeability, more frequent transit and expansion of routes/lines, decentering cars while making driving (and everyone) safer, &amp;c

2022-09-22 at 03:29:10: There's something in that. . . There's a feeling of infinitude that I want to combat. There's this sense where all of this sprawl feels completely unmanageable, uncountable, but it's just not so. And our city &amp; county governments could be doing that!

2022-09-14 at 05:19:05: And then her face fell, and she conceded, "No, I suppose you wouldn't." She sighed. "Get your things, Evelyn. You'll be staying with me tonight."

"Of course, ma'am."

I looked up at the windows, at the broad green valley in the height of summer.

And so now we're together again.

2022-09-14 at 05:19:05: And really, some of it might have been promising. But I was so far beyond trusting anything at this point. Certainly not her. "I wouldn't have much of a choice to say no, ma'am, would I?"

What the fuck did I just ask her?

That was a suicide attempt.

She glared at me, ice cold.

2022-09-14 at 05:19:04: As if we'd just bumped into each other at the store.

I didn't have anything to say, and she could see I was getting uncomfortable. "I've been thinking about you," she continued. "Would you like to return to your old duties, Ev? I think you'll agree a lot has changed." Sure had.

2022-09-14 at 05:19:04: (cont) https://t.co/w2i8gK3FoI

She puts her hand under my chin and lifts my head to look at her. She's tense. Conflicted. But I can see the hunger in her eyes, and I know I'll be packing my bunk up and moving back in with her now.

"I'm glad I've ran into you, Evelyn," she said.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:09: Can't afford to fall into the trap of defaulting to caretaker. That has to be the cover, but if I'm not careful, I'll lose sight of myself and who knows if I'll ever get out after that.

I don't want to die here. I don't want to be another one of her victims. Not forever that is.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:08: She gestured at me to come down, and so I did. She was a solid foot and a half taller than me, though almost as slender. She hoarded so much food for herself, but seemed to eat so little of it. I'd always been trying to get her to eat more. I wonder if she still--

NO. Focus, Ev.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:08: And she looked at me with those bewitching green eyes and I saw that she was feeling actual remorse, and I knew that I would pay the price for making her actually feel the psychic weight of her life on the people around her. Her captives.

For now, I had to be ready for anything.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:07: And she came into the room and she turned around and looked straight at me, and I stared back, wide-eyed, terrified. I watched her expression as she registered my own, as she noticed that I radiated fear with every shiver of my distressed, crouched, small, fragile, underfed body.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:07: But she did say, softly, but still out loud, so I was sure to hear, "Thank you, Ev."

And then my body betrayed me. Years of planning undone all at once.

I coughed.

Just one soft cough. Soft enough to ignore. If she'd wanted to. 

She did not.

She turned around, and came back.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:06: And it lasted, for a lot longer than I thought. But it didn't last forever. Nothing does -- thank every godde! 

Likewise, I couldn't believe she was still just standing there. I think she decided the little diversion was over herself, eventually. She didn't see me as she turned.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:06: She ran out of things to scroll through, and looked up through the windows as she pocketed her phone. Even more grey mixed in with the strawberry blonde, I noticed. Sometimes I miss running my hands through that hair.

Mostly I miss the days before that. We were *friends*. Once.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:05: I didn't trust her right now. She might have the best intentions, but eventually she was just going to get irritated with one or both of us and send me away. I was tired of hoping things would turn out any different, and this was not the season of her life to give it another try.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:05: She'd gotten too far into the room, I was worried that as she turned around to leave she would see me. But for now she just stood there, and I just squatted and worried and waited.

She started scrolling on her phone. Wow.

She really was deliberating, huh? Shit. Shit! Not now!!!

2022-09-14 at 05:18:04: Her hair had gotten even more beautiful -- though she wasn't taking great care of it. That's all I could see of her. The top back of her head, the very tops of her shoulders. She was far too close. Surely she could hear my heartbeat drumming in her ears just as loud as I could???

2022-09-14 at 05:18:04: I stop hearing the steps, but I imagine she hasn't stopped. And soon, I see the top of her head poking out below me. And she stops, just at the edge of sight. I'm perched above her, crouched up in the alcove, holding my breath and praying to any god for her to just go take a nap.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:03: The room is well-lit by the late-morning sky, despite being a cloudy day; the clouds were thin, no sign of a storm. Yet. I'm staring down at the floor, lit up like a church in the glow of the large, thinly-veiled windows (I think this may have been a chapel once).

Waiting. Shhh.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:03: Even a few months ago I might have been excited. And someday, maybe, things will get better. But right now, there's no way I'm answering. My breath becomes harder to control. My legs begin to shake, but I don't dare shift to a more comfortable position.

A soft step. Another. &amp;c.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:02: I hadn't heard her start to move again, and figured she probably hadn't. I did my best to keep calm, my breath slow and quiet. I was more scared than I thought I'd be. I strain to hear anything -- and just then she calls out, "Evelyn?" Not quite calling really, but talking aloud.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:02: It was almost like a balcony, but too small, and with no rails. Mostly used to store things that we servants used.

'Servants.' Whatever we are. Prisoners. Masochists.

It wasn't recessed very far, so the ledge that wasn't taken up with bins and boxes was a somewhat narrow perch.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:01: Fuck.

Three heavy steps in my direction, and then she stops. I can't think of anything she'd want in this whole side of the compound: she must have heard me. I don't have a way out, so I quietly climb a short ladder up to an overhead storage space in the ceiling above the door.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:01: I heard her turn around, at which point the phone would have been in her line of sight; and sure enough, I hear a few footsteps, and the slight scrape of phonecase on wood, and the surprisingly clicky 'click' of its lock button.

I expected her to go lay down.

Footfalls. Hither.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:00: I'd pretty much finished, I'd just taken the rare opportunity to stop rushing around after her for a moment. Now I take three bounding leaps, as quietly as I can, cursing myself for letting my guard down.

At first, I thought I'd succeeded. Across the hall, she crossed the room.

2022-09-14 at 05:18:00: It's not that she never loved me. But I didn't see how that love was tangled up with what she wanted to exploit from me. Not until it was too late. Not until none of that love mattered anymore.

I feel her footfalls through the floor up my bare feet. Sooner than expected. Closer.

2022-09-14 at 05:17:59: But always at hand. Always picking up after her and trying to help set her up -- though since I'm constrained, having to stay undetected, I can't do much to help her. It's frustrating watching my efforts go to waste when I'd be happy to do so much more to help.

I loved her once.

2022-09-14 at 05:17:59: "It's not what we agreed to!" she'd once barked at me, losing her temper and throwing a tantrum because I'd dared to reveal myself &amp; ask a clarifying question. That was a long time ago now. As far as I know she hasn't thought about me in years. Just like we agreed.

Out of sight.

2022-09-14 at 05:17:58: She has to never know I helped her find it. Must be subtle. A slight shift of the angles. Move the nearby picture frames, slight distance, point their edges slightly toward it, make sure the reflective side of the phone is facing upward. Not too well! So she won't notice the help

2022-09-14 at 05:17:57: She knows she's being a brat, and this always seems to make it worse. But then I catch a lucky break: she notices she needs to pee, and goes to. I gently step to where she'd left the phone, a shelf that wasn't at all where she was looking.

I've gotten very good at the next part.

2022-09-14 at 05:17:57: She's lost her phone somewhere in the house. The floor rumbles with her sure, heavy footfalls as she rushes around trying to find it. I'm waiting for the opportune moment --

And I leap forward from one room to another, landing agile and silent and hugging the corner to the hall.

2022-09-14 at 05:17:56: "Out of sight, always at hand." Those are the rules. Have been for years now. She terrifies me. I used to want to let her get her glimpses of me. Now I wish I could just stay on the far side of our little world, out of her way. Not an option.

I do feel like this is s/t a lot of people are struggling with, either for the 1st time or at a new level. Which is both comforting *and* depressing xD

2022-09-09 at 20:13:08: @SentientSpinch A neverending chore at that! Often lately I see food less as a place to receive nourishment and more as a minefield of digestive pain. I'm not as good a cook as you but I think it's the ingredients' quality going down. And the stress of living in this fucking country period.

2022-09-09 at 05:15:34: @chercher_ai That one does cause some tension tho. Bc she is certainly open to me exploring mediumship but she has this childhood fear of ouija boards from horror movies, and so (for example) *I* don't know exactly automatic writing with an intent to channel is different to her, but it is.

2022-09-09 at 05:12:03: @chercher_ai I'm fortunate that she's had her own colorful mental health history.

Big exception is ouija boards.

2022-09-08 at 15:12:56: Ableism is a death force, and it's coming for you and your loved ones. It will not be a 'woke' issue when you're trying to get your ssi. It is a system designed to quietly get millions sick and let them die, and covid is an opportunity that this eugenic deathforce knew how to use

2022-09-08 at 15:12:55: Fortunately despite being really upsetting, none of this is v surprising. Disability activists have seen this coming since March 2020.

And still no word from the disability insurance people, despite calling them daily for weeks now.

2022-09-05 at 00:02:41: And since v little could fool -proof it, you'd basically only be helping people like me, who are already in the process of becoming proficient at boot troubleshooting. So... Just too little incentive in the ecosystem for it to appear.

2022-09-05 at 00:02:40: So by the time you've reached the technomancy level to make the kind of guardrails I'm envisioning, creating that has thereby become so much more tedious a process than 98% of boot issues that it's obviously not worth worrying about. To them, anyway.

2022-09-05 at 00:02:40: But like... They mostly suck because it catches you off guard and you don't know what to do. Most boot problems are actually p quick to diagnose and fix once you're familiar with the common types of issues.

2022-09-05 at 00:02:39: All that I understood already. What I didn't get was, why aren't there more guardrails in place, better/clearer UX to minimize mistakes? Bc of the same factors in the last tweet, those guardrails would be tricky to implement. But wouldn't it be worth it? Boot problems suck!

2022-09-05 at 00:02:39: So boot stuff is fundamental, but because it's so early in the abstractification process it has to stay v small and simple, but it has to have the right mix of simple to complexity to be versatile. As a result of all that, it's kind of fragile -- easily borkable.

2022-09-05 at 00:02:39: I've been bemoaning the borkability of boot and USB issues, wondering how it's been allowed to continue like this. And I think I just envisioned it? Seems more true for boot stuff but would explain both.

Like that soda was still perfectly cold and carbonated.

And I got a p normal-sized grocery run (and didn't even bring a backpack) (and I could add more storage to this easily) (and I got bread!).

--Psalm 113

2022-09-03 at 07:27:21: For who is like Lord our God, who dwells in the heights of heaven
Yet looks upon the humble in heaven and on earth?
Raising the needy from the dirt, lifting the poor one up from the heap of trash,
To set them with them with the nobles, the nobles of their peoples.

2022-09-03 at 07:27:20: [Hallelu-Jah!]
Praise, servants of Lord, praise the name of Lord.
May the name 'Lord' be blessed, both now and forever.
From the rising of the sun to its setting, the name Lord is worthy of praise.
Exalted above all peoples is Lord; and above the heavens her glory.

2022-09-03 at 01:04:32: @egregirls Once heard someone say s/t like "Lack of hierarchy doesn't imply a lack of status," and its contrapositive "Status doesn't imply hierarchy." That's how I tend to think of it. There are just historical, contextual, and practical differences betw different relationships.

2022-09-03 at 00:55:38: @goblinodds Poly on dating apps? Absolutely can! The stakes feel a bit lower when I'm not necessarily counting on 1 relationship to fulfill all the needs. Allows our romantic gestures to be more genuine, bc way less desperation. And makes it easier to accept if the chemistry just isn't there

2022-09-02 at 23:55:32: @goblinodds I met my wife on a dating app :3 Think they work infinitely better for poly ppl, tho I think a lot of the same downsides/pitfalls do still apply. But not having the pressure of needing each other to be The One helped us allow shared context some time/space to develop organically.

2022-09-02 at 23:34:24: @goblinodds I met my wife on a dating app :3 I think it helps that I wasn't using the app with long term relationships necessarily in mind -- like I think our relationship would have been weaker if it'd started out both of us wanting the other to be our future spouse necessarily.

2022-08-24 at 18:36:13: Huh I'd never noticed there are seven different transliterated words total before. They loved that numerological shit and seven is a big-deal number. I wonder if they did it on purpose. 

I'm a big fan of the practice of language-mixing, despite being relatively monoglotal myself

2022-08-24 at 18:36:12: *Amen (heb, it is so / let it be / 'I agree with the prayer you just said for my sake')
*Alleluia (from hallelu-Yah'[weh], 'Praise ye [the] Lord.')
*Sabaoth ('of [the angelic army's] hosts')
*Mysterium (greek mysterion, 'sacrament,' 'mystery,')

2022-08-24 at 18:36:12: Anyway I find it interesting, the word Sabaoth, because it is one of /very few/ words in the old Roman Mass that were transliterated instead of being translated into Latin. 
*'Kyrie eleison, Christe eleison,' (gk for for 'Lord [/Christ] have mercy.' Still used by several sects)

2022-08-24 at 18:36:11: The Latin's grammatical ambiguity lends itself to seeing Sabaoth as something of a title. The Jerusalem Bible treats it this way in its translations. (cf. 1 Sam 1:3) (Hebrew transliterations are kinda the schtick of TJB.) I generally think of God as Lord (name) Sabaoth (title).

2022-08-24 at 18:36:11: "Holy, Holy, Holy Lord God Sabaoth" is usually what I'd say in English.

The word 'Sabaoth,' as OP goes on to say, is a Latin transliteration of a Hebrew word meaning '[military] hosts.' It usually gets translated either "Lord God /of hosts/" or "Lord, God /of power and might/."

2022-08-24 at 18:36:10: From a thread on Anglican translation of source materials, looking at this tidbit inherited/retained in many a Sunday service across high-church sects: Sanctus Sanctus Sanctus Dominus Deus Sabaoth.

2022-08-24 at 17:48:39: I had no idea. No idea! Had this keyboard for like 7-8 years now. The buttons are all right there, I just didn't know what they meant and how they worked!

The raw power of that. . . That's a lot of functionality! 

I've gotta get the thing I need to plug it into my computer.

2022-08-24 at 17:48:39: Noticed how I said you tell it the 'original' key you recorded the pattern in? That's because even user-made rhythms support 'Casio Fingering,' which turns the bottom of the keyboard into a chord-selector -- *and then it will transpose your beat to match.*

2022-08-24 at 17:48:38: So that's already pretty neat, yeah? I can record looping audio, continuously adding to it until I have a whole beat going, on my lil electric piano. BUT WAIT THERE'S MORE.

2022-08-24 at 17:48:37: And so the user-pattern recorder supports all of these as well, so that you can record your own intro, fillers, and outro to your beat, each also w five tracks -- and ofc you can always record multiple layers on the same track as long as you use the same voice.

2022-08-24 at 17:48:37: It can, if you ask it to, quantize your inputs at 1/4, 8th, 8-triplet, 16th, 16th-triplet, and 32nd notes. 

The pre-installed patterns use buttons on the front panel you can you use to switch briefly from the main pattern to an intro, one of two fillers, or an outro.

2022-08-24 at 17:48:36: There are nine on-board slots for user-made music-patterns. A loop w one drum track, a bass track, and three open tracks. You can set the number of measures in the loop (up to 16), the time signature, and the original (👀) key you're recording in, among a few other things.

2022-08-24 at 17:48:35: Just had a very "It was here the WHOLE TIME?" moment with my casio keyboard.

Turns out it's got way more functionality than I thought.

2022-08-17 at 19:10:54: But I think these nudges would shift the fabric of the hyper-local economies fairly drastically, and I also think that if you take a car to work but not anywhere else that's still a lot fewer trips.

2022-08-17 at 19:10:53: I'm thinking about a lot of the big industrial employers, and the inaccessible locations they're in. About how the poorest people here often have to make the longest commutes in the slowest fashions. This city is only bikeable if you live really close to your job, or don't commut

2022-08-17 at 19:10:53: In this metro area, I imagine in most/all in US, there are trips to work that would be unreasonably long and/or dangerous for a daily commute. It would take a lot more intentional pressure to get jobs and homes closer to each other and/or better linked by transit/bike infrastr.

2022-08-17 at 19:10:52: The biggest sticking point, to my mind, besides the raw power and influence of the car egregore, is still going to come back to how bad the transit system is, I think. Because this all works a lot better if most people are also commuting without cars to work, but. . .

2022-08-17 at 19:10:52: *And* you would have infrastructure in place to make cycling to the grocery store instead a safe and speedy option. Give /them/ the direct routes.

And of course if we change zoning laws maybe we can make truly walkable neighborhoods.

2022-08-17 at 19:10:51: If your 6-minute drive to the grocery store now takes 7.5-8 minutes along a less direct route, but there's less traffic, fewer stoplights/signs, and basically no danger of hitting any pedestrians or cyclists? It would /feel/ faster, and be less stressful.

2022-08-17 at 19:10:51: We just refuse to go in that direction. And it sucks bc this vision /can/ still include cars, just w lower top speeds and longer routes - but roads w less traffic, signals/signage, and no cyclists because we're on bike paths and/or other car-closed streets, faster average speed.

2022-08-17 at 19:10:51: It's not that these are completely bike-friendly places, but some are bike-tolerant, and w the right nudges and some more cyclists on the road getting drivers used to the idea, a small shift is all it'd take, really. Feels pie-in-the-sky, yet I see the way there: it's p short!

2022-08-17 at 19:10:50: But I'll be damned, I'm shocked to discover just how close it is to already being a bikeable place. Not everywhere -- especially not outside the 270 belt -- but the city itself, University City next door, many of the municipalities in mid county and noco south of the rock road.

2022-08-17 at 19:10:50: There are a few places in the city where maybe you could limp by just walking, if you have tons of free time and no job. But if there's anyone in STL who can safely walk to work, &amp; a quality grocery store, *&amp;* a hardware store, *&amp;* a metrolink station. . . they've hit the jackpot

2022-08-17 at 19:10:49: There aren't any truly walkable areas in the whole metro region. (They're trying to make North City one we'll see how gentrification goes.) Busses and trains so irregular/slow/out-of-the-way that doesn't help much; you can limp by if you're poor and desperate, or rich w free time

2022-08-17 at 19:10:49: Google Maps thinks that I could bike the 9 miles through the city to the university in 10 minutes less than it would take me to do the same journey by catching the bus and the train. And that's even after making the bike route longer and safer. Our transit system is so garbage.

[What? Unintended consequences of an overly-scattered sense of self w/out cohesive integration? I'm shocked to find there's gambling in this establishment.]

2022-08-17 at 04:44:42: Idk, maybe I'm overthinking this. I just, I know I can work myself to the point of resentment for somebody else, and I'd really like to not somehow end up v resentful of Future Me.

2022-08-17 at 04:44:42: These things have a lot of meaning for me! But I can't help but worry that my current means of motivation isn't justified by the ends? I can't just live for Future Me. But Present Me finds security in knowing that Future Me will have someone helping them out: me.

2022-08-17 at 04:44:41: What if I became one of those people who doesn't clean their cast iron skillet til the *next* use? Horrifying. Or what if I stop being able to reflexively rely on the water-bottle on my nightstand being full, my weekly by-day pillbox prepared for my meds in the morning? Etc etc.

2022-08-17 at 04:44:41: That's actually slightly scary to think about, which I hadn't expected. I start worrying that without the future-thinking motivation, I won't have those lovely moments of having prepared for myself.

2022-08-17 at 04:44:41: But that's Present giving to Past, and the two of them giving to Future, but Future still isn't giving much in return. 

Ofc it's hard for Future to reach back at all.

I feel like 'the trick (tm)' is to increase one's ability &amp; bandwidth to act-live-be Present Self.

2022-08-17 at 04:44:40: Cooking is a place where I feel like there's better relationship between Past, Present, and Future Me. Cooking is a decision by Present Me to prepare food for Future Me, and to honor Past Me's desire for food w *good* food, not just the first thing Present Me can grab and eat.

2022-08-17 at 04:44:40: Future Me does do their part keeping the things we archive. But ofc Past and Present had to make those archives in the first place. And forgiveness: I know I can count on Future Me to be understanding and forgiving. (Maybe I could have Future praying for past selves?)

2022-08-17 at 04:44:39: But there is *very* little reciprocity there. Future Me doesn't do *shit* for Past Me! I don't 100% know what that would look like but I think either I need to figure out or choose a different framing for combination clean-up/pre-set-up. As it stands, Past Me is Future Me's bitch

2022-08-17 at 04:44:39: My intention is v specifically 'I want to do this as a gift for myself in the future, I want to take some extra time and energy now so that I won't have to spend it later.' And that works well for me it's a great mindset/suite of little habits.

2022-08-17 at 04:44:39: I am *constantly* doing things for future-me. I mean, everyone is. But so, for ex, I'm v much the kind of person who will completely clean/reset something the moment I'm done w it, and prepare it for me to just immediately start using the next time.

2022-08-17 at 04:44:38: The dynamics between Past Me and Future Me are really sweet and also p fucked up. (On-brand.) They've changed over the last few years. And though it's gotten better, it's also gotten more one-sided, and that's starting to add up. https://t.co/XcESOoXXOu

2022-08-15 at 20:25:51: This kind of collaboration seems p common in the tech world actually. In lots of different forms. Crowd-development is mainly what I'm thinking of, I guess?

Left-turn: What would a crowd-developed novel look like? Surely we (humanity)'ve done this already? I mean at scale.

2022-08-15 at 20:25:51: All created in some grade of collaboration, but with about as low a social barrier to entry as possible. (Ofc tiktok doesn't actually allow for this tree to be navigated v well, maybe this is on Daydreamy Better TikTok.)

2022-08-15 at 20:25:50: Some people add to the original bass-line or chord progression or whatever the original 'seed' for the day is, leaving space for a third person to come in and either add more harmony or lay down the melody.

2022-08-15 at 20:25:49: I'm just trying to wrap my head around what parallel collaboration would look like at all, just establishing the idea so I can play w it, not trying to present it as some central value.

2022-08-15 at 20:25:48: So it's not a binary thing. [Shock.]

But like I said, I think that incentives toward close collaboration are good things to have in a culture, and I'd want to avoid anything that would have a chilling effect on working together.

2022-08-15 at 20:25:48: There will always be people whose desire to contribute to the collective is disproportionate to their ability to actually feel like part of the collective. For some people, that's a political stance toward personal autonomy. For some it's autism. And it fluctuates with time.

2022-08-15 at 20:25:47: The point was to imagine parallel collaboration. I don't know that systems should design themselves around favoring that style, but where it can be accommodated that seems like a reasonable move. (Ofc I'm v pro-accomodating ppl generally.)

2022-08-15 at 20:25:47: This is more thought experiment than suggestion, though. Something feels a bit off about it, a bit icky; but the simulated crowd in my head is throwing too many obvious suggestions at me to focus on the subtle, actual thing that's bugging me about it this moment.

2022-08-15 at 20:25:46: And so one of the things each person submitting a work would indicate is if they're comfortable with these discussion groups picking their work. Again, not with the harsh idea that no one can ever discuss the other works, but maybe encouraging that be less public.

2-3 times/yr?

2022-08-15 at 20:25:46: But it is extra accommodation for some people, to have that be opt-in as the hyper-local/event-specific norm-vibe.

There could also be something akin to discussion groups or seminars, getting together to dive deeper into the points of one or a group of related essays.

2022-08-15 at 20:25:45: This can't be very authoritative or strict, but just to have  a space for everyone participating to present those boundaries. The default is "Not really looking to follow up on this."But ofc people will, and that's not necessarily bad. And hopefully most people *want* feedback.

2022-08-15 at 20:25:45: Just something indicating whether you want feedback or not, whether you're open to debating a contentious point or not, whether people should @ &amp;/or DM you to talk about this topic more or not, etc.

2022-08-15 at 20:25:45: All of the published works are collected/collated somehow, so that now you have a wide range of voices on a topic everyone was interested in seeing essays about, all in one place.

Then you can opt-in to follow-up discussions/etc. I mean ppl will talk on their tl about w/e, but

2022-08-15 at 20:25:44: Imagining. . .

Community-wide calls for essays/articles/long-threads on a certain topic (chosen by community vote or s/t),  w a set time-ish for posting them all, so that none end up being reaction-takes of the other. Collaboration and/or co-authorship allowed but not required

2022-08-15 at 20:25:43: Not perfectly parallel, for one thing. But then neither is parallel play. There's communication happening there. [Another thread here about how to create structures that also nudge such people to work in closer collabs but this thread isn't opining on trying to change behavior.]

2022-08-15 at 20:25:43: Mmkay, so what does parallel collaboration look like then? What does it look like when we have structures/systems/cultures that are built with parallel collaboration in mind? What does that look like?

A lot of people bounce pretty hard between "believe in God" and "God is a fiction." Or even, like, "Spending money conservatively" vs "Spending liberally." The more binary stuff.

2022-08-13 at 17:39:15: @TheHummingVoid OH, well wait no because where I notice this the most is in places where there are clear, polarized dichotomies in the zeitgeist. So, like, decent example might be "Loyalty to one's friends and family is a Key Value" vs "You don't owe anyone your time and attention."

2022-08-13 at 17:36:17: @TheHummingVoid Hmm, I mean, I saw it in myself first, and then I saw it everywhere. (As is my idiom.)

2022-08-13 at 15:58:57: @WeftOfSoul I feel like I'm 9/10ths of the way to understanding the thrust of this thread. Sounds like you're saying, "Yes these dichotomies can be overbearing, but focusing on the places where they blur together is still focusing through the frame of that dichotomy, and not as interesting"?

2022-08-13 at 15:40:02: @hankgreen Another way to look at this: "8/10" isn't "8 divided by 10," it's "8 10ths." We can write division as fractions because division really *is* just fractions. I find subtraction useful enough but srsly division is more confusing than helpful, let it be multiplication and fractions.

2022-08-13 at 15:01:05: @hankgreen Division doesn't really exist, what looks like 8/10 is 8 x 1/10th, and 10/8 is really 10 x 1/8th, and those clearly aren't the same. Same with subtraction: it's really just addition, we write it as subtraction for simplification purposes.

2022-08-09 at 18:39:57: Just feels like there's lots of unnecessary own-goals via self-fulfilling prophetic admonitions to each other, at every scale of society. Maybe aiming for socratic Gadfly, but hitting collective Cassandra instead.

2022-08-09 at 18:39:56: And maybe that process of discernment would get a couple people sending rage-y vibes who hadn't let themselves before, and that might be needed. God I *hope* I've made that clear: a healthy community has a diversity of vibes, including ones that hew toward conflict.

2022-08-09 at 18:39:55: Srsly, it's truly not for me to judge any one person's patterns of vibes, not someone I don't know particularly well at least. But I have a hunch that if we all collectively checked to see if we were actually putting out the vibes we wanted, we'd on average put out better vibes.

2022-08-09 at 18:39:55: And so of course writing a thread like this, I really worry that someone's going to, for example, use it as fuel to smug about those 'whiny/confrontational leftists/trannies,' which... doesn't seem to me that anyone's even ready to have that conversation *intra*-community yet 😶

2022-08-09 at 18:39:54: Infuriatingly, 'tone-policing is bad' is a leftist talking point the critics of which are often un-self-aware, hypocritical tone police themselves, bringing so much easy-to-use fuel for the perpetual-conflict-machine. Leftists dump their own self-awareness in response. Fun times

2022-08-09 at 18:39:54: I think it becomes tone-*policing*, more limiting than useful, when my focus shifts from clarity and intention toward people-pleasing and obsessive-thought-spirals. And sometimes something is worth shouting my intense, raw, violent reaction about, and I don't want to stifle that.

It's not just about being more likely to be a positive interaction. It also gives me a chance to stop and see if I'm just saying something to feel smugly superior, or w/e -- it's a motives check.

2022-08-09 at 18:39:52: And it's not just emotional tone, this is wrapped up in a lot of communication unforced-errors. Same feelings I get when I think of using "I should" instead of "you should" statements, checking when I'm speaking more generally than I should, seldom using imperative verbs,

[also important to mention: sometimes fury is the right tone; sometimes bitter snark /is/ the right tone, just not every day; it's not abt tones as good vs. bad, it's just noticing everything that I'm choosing to communicate.]

2022-08-09 at 18:39:51: A lot of ideas that I could engage, even agree, w if not for some corrosive snark or smug superiority. I know that when I catch myself using those tones, it's often bc I'm projecting s/t. If I care about the idea I can at least have good-humored snark and humble, sure conviction.

2022-08-09 at 18:39:50: I'm toying with the idea that tone-monitoring is good, actually, and that the tone with which a message is delivered is actually as important as the content itself. Tone has power. It shifts vibes way more than the words themselves.

Still: I just like not being cold. Lizard, rock, etc.

To think otherwise is to demean the Buddha - which is to demean oneself."(Pirsig)

2022-07-30 at 22:36:21: @lisatomic5 @goblinodds Yes! Like "It's expensive to be poor" but for social competency/status.

2022-07-30 at 22:02:05: (I keep coming back to this, so def worth counter-emphasizing: I've tried using this to by-pass the other truth, that there rly is nothing spcl about me, or you, or anyone -- turns out not allowing yourself or anyone else to be normal is *stressful*, do not recommend.)

2022-07-30 at 22:02:04: There's so much truth to find in the mines of "Nobody's special," 💯. But is that always where the dismissive reaction is coming from? Or s/t, is the part(s) of me that does still want to be special jealous, having a hard time remembering that **special is not a zero-sum game**?

2022-07-30 at 22:02:04: When I'm tempted to roll my eyes because someone is talking about a way in which they're special, or part of a special group,

I should stop to check and see if I just need to remember a way that I'm special, remember that there's s/t special about every group.

2022-07-30 at 21:38:20: Me (reaching one skinny-gangly hand behind my back to grab a fistful of pale-ass, smooth-dry skin above the opposite shoulder to help me creak-and-crack it around the socket to help a rib slip back into place): "It's a shame we'll never know for sure if I have EDS or w/e" /j

2022-07-19 at 18:42:04: @SentientSpinch Right, I'm crispy too xD cause often the effects are the same either way, the former person just isn't doing their manipulation as consciously/maliciously.

2022-07-19 at 18:39:36: @SentientSpinch 💯💯💯 And I mean I think it can be taken to cold place, I've done that myself, but to me it's really just about honesty about what's actually going on in a given relationship (of any kind ofc). If I choose it, clear-eyed, it's very different, much healthier -- *sustainable*.

2022-07-19 at 18:26:29: @SentientSpinch Yeah, it's such a trap! And often (at least subconsciously) an intentional one, a strategy to get affirmation. Makes it easier to write people off as uncaring, too, if they don't give that validation. Leaves less room for other possibilities.

2022-07-18 at 23:50:45: Books can have this problem too but I find it happens less often.

Otoh in writing specifically, I feel like this could be (s/t actually is) used intentionally to good effect: "trashy" fanfic, "junk" television-- sometimes you only want the pleasant emotional surface of something

2022-07-18 at 23:50:45: See this in bad TV a lot, where the writing (plot or dialogue) is basically just a low-grade parroting of what successful and/or high-quality shows would've written. 

A huge amount of interpersonal culture in the US feels like it's larping actual human connection.

2022-07-18 at 23:50:45: "Gesturing toward the thing the gesture is suggestive of instead of actually doing the thing":using a keychange to suggest complication and surprise and intensity, but instead is actually simple, cliche, and boring.

2022-07-17 at 22:09:01: @KanekoTheKoolio That command reboots the system and forces the BIOS screen to open on reboot, and after tinkering with the bios settings and knocking on wood the keyboard started working on the grub screen.

2022-07-17 at 18:34:35: Today's computer challenge: kubuntu and grub now installed, but now keyboard isn't being detected on bootup until after grub which means I can neither boot into Windows nor pull up my BIOS setup.

2022-07-09 at 15:33:28: I used to read fantasy voraciously, hadn't read any since I came back to reading for pleasure. Hadn't realized I was avoiding them in part due to concerns over my own impressionability.

Wizard of Earthsea was thus a p good pick for my first fantasy book since like 2014.

2022-07-09 at 14:33:28: This kind of ego-weaving is so good at making me feel worse about myself than I would if I didn't think I had anything to prove.

2022-07-09 at 14:33:28: But it doesn't look enough like conventional exercise for my ego to feel satisfied -- as if exercise wouldn't count unless it were more painful and exhausting, and wouldn't be worth it unless I did some impressive, legible workout I can seek validation for.

2022-07-09 at 14:33:27: One good thing to come out of being sick has been noticing all of the little things I do all the time that I take for granted and don't register, but which are harder/unwise to do while sick. Good ex.: I often feel like I 'should' be someone who exercises  -- I *do* exercise!

2022-07-09 at 14:04:19: Ironically, a mistake often made when tone-policing angry people 🥲

2022-07-09 at 14:04:19: It's not anger I have a problem with, because there's nothing inherently vibe-damaging about anger. It's using anger as an *excuse* to bend truth and/or be mean that seems so common and disheartening. To overstate the case, &amp;or be cruel in ways that contradict one's own purposes.

2022-07-01 at 15:08:27: (NB: this is not me shitting on drag, an essential part of our history and still a major part. Plenty of drag performers *are* trans, for that matter. The moral isn't 'drag sucks,' it's that if you use drag performers to model all trans people, your model will be wrong.)

2022-07-01 at 15:08:26: That was not the last time the conflation of drag queens and trans women would hurt me. I've been handed books because it was assumed I'd relate to the character who's a drag queen. I do not! 

My transness is not drag, and it is not a performance.

2022-07-01 at 15:08:26: I wasn't what dad described, and he made it clear he'd laugh at me if I tried to explore anything around it. So for 12 yrs I assumed I wasn't trans, up until I started seeing trans women my age who didn't give a *fuck* about makeup and high-fem presentation and passing. (And BMO)

2022-07-01 at 15:08:25: So of course when he tried to explain trans women to me, he really just described drag queens, conflated them with gay cis men, and made a lot of subtly disparaging jokes. I knew I was more tomboy than boy, most of my friends were girls, but this stunted me, hard.

2022-07-01 at 15:08:25: Dad was, and still is, the kind of person who refuses to actually engage with transness. He has a conception of gender that doesn't have room for it, but also doesn't care about other people much and doesn't wanna fight about "that stuff." Not accepting exactly, just apathetic.

2022-07-01 at 15:08:24: Maybe as early as like 7-8; certainly no later than like 12.

The actual story is kinda messed up, because one of the first family friends I ever met was a trans woman. But of course I was not supposed to ask her questions. Mom had my dad explain -- but ofc he didn't know either. https://t.co/MfdnBiFxpF

2022-06-28 at 13:26:13: @flybottlemist Yw!

2022-06-28 at 13:25:27: @flybottlemist Propylene glycol, it basically just gives things a throatier hit. Small amounts in some flavorants, common additive to nicotine solutions.

2022-06-28 at 11:52:33: @saul_mondriaan You're doing beads, right? Unless they're super-brittle, doesn't need to be packed perfectly tight, some jostle should be fine, maybe just put a bit of padding around (loosely-packed balls of paper would work even) in case it gets smushed/stepped on in transit.

2022-06-28 at 11:40:03: @saul_mondriaan It might be a little lower but it also might not. Are you using a flat-rate box or envelope? If not that might be cheaper. USPS is expensive and p byzantine even by shipping standards

2022-06-28 at 11:24:05: @flybottlemist Source on all this: I used to date a huge cloudchaser who made all their own shit and was really into it, they taught me how to do some of it myself, I vaped for a little over four years, quit just over a year ago. /9

2022-06-28 at 11:22:57: @flybottlemist And then wrapping the cotton into a wick is very simple but very precise, takes trial-and-error. Coils, if you find a good tutorial you can get it done first or second try. /8

2022-06-28 at 11:21:05: @flybottlemist I can't give you a ton of solid info there, b/c it's so context-dependent. The gauge of wire, the strength of the battery, the wattage you set your mod for, the diameter of the wrap of wire, the number of wraps, are all related variables. But again, lots of help out there. /7

2022-06-28 at 11:17:19: @flybottlemist Make sure you get the right kind of batteries -- I think it will vary from mod to mod, there are *tons* of tutorials out there for this stuff though, all this stuff.

The most tedious part, ime, is having to wrap your own coils and make your own wicks. /6

2022-06-28 at 11:15:17: @flybottlemist You'll want a module (the modular core of the device) with a regulating chip (unregulated mods are not beginner-friendly, potentially v dangerous), an atomizer assembly (usually comes with 'bats', the end-tube you inhale through, you'll need one if it doesn't), and batteries. /5

2022-06-28 at 11:12:36: @flybottlemist You can usually get the same effect with a lot less nic, worth trying out.

The vape itself is more complicated. /4

2022-06-28 at 11:09:37: @flybottlemist You can usually get like 3-6 flavorants and make a recipe or three with them. Trying to make your own mixes is usually going to go poorly to start, and substitutions can be tricky to make, so can't recommend recipes enough. Pick your own nicotine % too, that's a plus. /3

2022-06-28 at 11:06:17: That's my emotional support sin

2022-06-28 at 11:04:31: @flybottlemist Buy a scale and some pipettes. Then go to a site like alltheflavors which will let you browse recipes and/or search by flavorants. The recipes will specify which brand and variety, so you can easily order the ones you want wherever they're being distributed. /2

2022-06-28 at 11:02:24: @flybottlemist Your own juice:
Buy Vegetable glycerin and nicotine solution (easy to find on Amazon), recommend you get nic with PG in it, would recommend you not play with adding your own PG in until you have more experience (gives a 'snappier' hit but can overwhelm) /1

2022-06-24 at 11:16:52: A third person I do not see picks me up, shoots me out, and I soar, and I don't hit the ground, I just fly. I don't see much, a snippet here or there, a garbled, muffled conversation flies by, then another. More orange and purple. Eventually I land alone in the split rock again.

2022-06-24 at 11:16:52: Then back in the woods, it was winter again, though the snow wasn't as smooth and thick a plane, scattered over the rocks and trees and undergrowth. A woman wearing the orange garment, an orange-and-purple aesthetic.

2022-06-24 at 11:16:51: At this point I interrupted myself, and as I settled back in I was the arrow and the archer and the bow, but all I saw was a field of purple and orange. It eventually became orange cloth. I played my fingers along the fabric. Suddenly there was a pair of legs under the fabric.

2022-06-24 at 11:16:51: Then it is a snowy day, and the black of my arrowshaft stands out against the plane of white. I hope that will make it more likely I'll be found. I am not. It is night again. Day. Sunny this time, but the shadows thicker, the trees casting more shade.

2022-06-24 at 11:16:51: Then it is night. The next day it is raining heavily, dark dark skies, and I hear the water slapping against the stone. My arrow is still stuck, unmoved, soaking in the rain. A longing to be retrieved, a fear that I never will be.

2022-06-24 at 11:16:50: I am the arrow, resting my weight against the tension of my life. The release. I soar. I smack into a rock in a forest, piercing it. The rock has a crack in it, a small tree growing out of it. It is daytime, a storm just past but clouds thin, day bright. Quiet. Early spring? https://t.co/kAy4gawk3z

2022-06-23 at 19:34:32: @0bviouSquirre1 Last year I turned 29, so 'now I'm turning 30' and that song has seen a lot of use in this household xD

2022-06-23 at 19:24:47: There are beings and people who thrive in this space, and will reinforce the pattern with me, which also makes me easier to manipulate. What started off as kink under my control has turned into real bondage. Or so I tell myself. Until at last I break free from that. A new circle.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:46: And I could blame others and the culture for my predicament because I'd used them to construct the circle. Use them to justify settling for whoever happened to be in my circle instead of driving out the people who don't belong there, defending those who do. A self fulfilling loop

2022-06-23 at 19:24:46: But I can just *be* sovereign over the space. Queen of the circle. The swords are for kink but also for driving out invaders.

Oh fuck. That's the other thing the circle did: if there *were* invaders who'd overpowered me. . . I "had" to put up with them, right?

2022-06-23 at 19:24:45: It feels like that makes me much more vulnerable, but the reality is that I was the only one making the circle at all safe in the first place, the gymnastics were about a permission-structure that I could leverage as motivation for maintaining sovereignty over the space.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:45: It would be a lot easier if I skipped all of the reality-bending and mental gymnastics and just drew a circle big enough for me, 8 swords, and maybe a top or two, and wrote "Mary has permission to kick you out of this circle if you mess with her."

2022-06-23 at 19:24:44: Which is fine sometimes, but like. . . the circle is a complex, difficult pattern to maintain, one that makes me vulnerable to my own shifting thoughts and moods and the fickle collective's thoughts and moods, and doesn't actually keep me safe. Just a permission slip for me.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:44: But like. . . the circle doesn't actually help make that particularly true. It just helps me feel justified. Justified in considering it a bound space. Justified in asserting it, in defending it, in pushing others out of it. But it doesn't form a boundary. It gestures at one.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:43: My own convictions that I'd stand behind, and the testimony of others, my perception of the social/cultural vibes, all arranged so that I have a place I feel justified in declaring, to myself and others, as safe for me, so that I can set up my swords and pull out my blindfold.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:43: OH. Not "from what." *FOR* what? Okay, yes, the loop can be set aside for now, I think, because the circle is actually all about the 8 of Swords: the circle serves as a place where I can feel justified to practice self-bondage. I think that was probably the original reasoning.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:42: What's up with that circle? It doesn't promote motion through a space to interact with all the parts of it, its only function is to bind, to set a bound. And yes that circle can be widened but like. . . what is it doing? Keeping me safe? From what?

2022-06-23 at 19:24:42: I sketched their virtues as "getting to know one area very intimately, in exploring every point along the pendulum's arc," but that really only applies to the mobius loop.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:41: Forget about whether it's a prison or not, just ask if the patterns are useful. It's two patterns: the mobius loop, and the circle.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:41: Which, also -- now that we've pulled out the 8 of Swords, I want to say that I love this card, that the ideas it represents have their healthy forms and contexts. But centering here it has occluded a simpler move: examine each shape on its own merits.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:40: Writing that out makes me realize that if you just pull the prison-ness, the 8 of Swords, out of the situation, the problem of what the pattern does becomes *much much* less constrained, because it's not literally centered around constraint at that point.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:40: So the question then becomes: is the loop-and-circle a prison? Do I need to deconstruct the loop-and-circle prison, or do I need to deconstruct the idea that is the loop-and-circle /being/ a prison at all? Hmm. Hmmmmm.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:39: I'm gonna cut it there, but you see how this goes, right? I'm constructing the loop-and-circle again, with thoughts about the construction itself. It's endlessly fractal and self-referential, I have found it can distract me for years.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:39: The planets all move in loops around the sun, but they also soar through the heavens with it, all moving forward. . . in loops around SagA*, but then forward through the intergalactic medium with it. 'Forward' isn't necessarily a useful descriptor of the way forward.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:38: I can keep myself going for a long time with that last concern, 'spiting a gift.' What I mean is: Often I have convinced myself not to do things in the way that is easy or natural for me, and wasted a lot of energy because it's not the 'right/proper' way. My ways are the gifts.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:38: Now I start constructing the next loop. On one end of the loop, fear of constraint, of being held back by the pattern. On the other end, fear of structurelessness, fear of having to come up with new ways of navigating/orienting, or that I might be trying to spite a gift.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:37: And here's a perfect example of how I get myself stuck: I see two opposite answers to that situation. One is to try and break the pattern of loops and circles, so I'd move in free space. Other is to try and widen the circle and lengthen the loop, shift the pattern, move together.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:37: You'd better fucking believe there are 8 swords in the middle of that circle and I'm just chilling there like "Damn, guess I'm not allowed to go anywhere!" And so I go to the edges of the circle and I set up the swords as my mobius loop to run forward but stay where it feels safe

2022-06-23 at 19:24:36: I also made a clever circle around myself, a fake circle made of real* convictions, mine and others and vibes, all signposts saying, "Worry less, fly free, grow any direction or way you want -- but not that way!" The circle is wrapped so these signs point out in every direction.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:36: This particular loop now bends to the truth that there is value in that: in getting to know one area very intimately, in exploring every point along the pendulum's arc and learning the process of the swing. Maybe these are lessons I needed. But on the other hand... Goes nowhere.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:35: I have the ability to skillfully fold the universe at the level of energy, emotion, and thought, and mostly what I do with it is construct mobius loops of pendulum-swings so that I can feel like I'm always moving forward while I loop around the same places over and over.

2022-06-23 at 19:24:35: When I started I did not know I was gonna have this much to write; live processing baby! This probably should've just been a journal entry but I wrote it here, so have it; maybe I'll get some extra dopamine that way.

Was thinking about my patterns. Wrote this tweet first:

2022-06-12 at 02:07:09: So yeah I hadn't really crystallized the fact that the center of that 5D labyrinth is a place where everything in the Xian cosmos comes together, and that we (God and each Xian/etc) are leaving each other gifts and messages at this Meet-up Point, the center of centers. Now I have

2022-06-12 at 02:07:09: It's like a Little Free Library for spiritual energy.

(Except way more gatekept in practice. So far at least.)

2022-06-12 at 02:07:08: And I can burn away what needs burning, and God can recycle the smoke. And I can take grace lovingly offered by every person/being linked in so many ways all to this same hyper-event.

2022-06-12 at 02:07:08: So at Mass, I bring what I am, offer it to God and to anyone else who can find grace in it, and to every version of myself past and future, and my ancestors and descendants and my neighbors and my nemeses and oppressors, and everyone everywhere everywhen who wants to access it.

2022-06-12 at 02:07:08: And the oil from this jar never empties (1 Kg 17), the grace from this 'cache' is never used up, and it can fill every vessel brought to the poor widow and still be abundant (2 Kg 4). Because God is bringing God's oil (grace) too, so there's way more going in the cache then out.

2022-06-12 at 02:07:07: We encounter every version of ourselves every time we've been at Mass (¿and otherwise united with the Divine?), and all the different versions of everyone else at each Mass, everywhere. We bring what we have, and we add it to the Communion of the Saints, and we take what we need,

2022-06-12 at 02:07:07: All of these places-times-people are all linked together, woven together as we navigate the 5D-labyrinth-ritual of the Mass. And then, when we get to the center, we encounter-devour-submit-become the Lord.

*And we find a geocache of grace.* From every Mass and every Xian ever.

2022-06-12 at 02:07:07: But so let's get to reason I started on this thread, besides just loving to blather about all the spiritual shit that makes me feel deep or whatever.

2022-06-12 at 02:07:07: Jesus on the cross, and Jesus after the Resurrection -- and also bread and wine, though maybe God consumes that part. And also this Eucharist is Jesus the other-Christ in each person at Mass: our lives, our souls offered on the altar next to Christ's.

2022-06-12 at 02:07:06: The altar is the wood of the cross, the table of the Last Supper, and the stone beside the empty tomb. The bread and wine are Whatever Christ Did At The Last Supper (it's complicated and not 100% clear and, surprise, tinged with antisemitic historiography),

2022-06-12 at 02:07:06: So there's Christ in the celebrant(s) -- and in all the congregants, but Xianity is big on mediation in parallel with direct access (have been wedged against each other obv). And Christ in heaven offering Mass. And Christ c. 33CE in Judea during the Triduum.

All of these, linked

2022-06-12 at 02:07:06: The celebrant(s) is channeling that other-Christ-ness to fill a ritual role; I'd argue that anyone could do it, but inclination and proficiency should play a role in deciding how a group would want to celebrate, how many (con-)celebrants and whom, what variations/house-rules, etc

2022-06-12 at 02:07:06: All Xians are priests, though historically the churches have made a fuss about monopolizing that magic and associating it with a bunch of unnecessary, usually harmful power dynamics (clerics, presbyters, preachers, etc). We are each and all an 'alter Christus', an other-Christ.

2022-06-12 at 02:07:05: The idea is that every time Mass is offered on earth, it is also being offered by Jesus-as-High-Priest on the altar in front of the Lord seated on the Cherubim-throne in heaven -- or more technically, each Mass is linked to that one heavenly Mass &amp;/which is linked to the Triduum.

2022-06-12 at 02:07:05: (Antisemitism and supercessionist theology have been baked into Xianity basically from the start. This ritual appears to have developed in part because early Xians were no longer able to access Temple worship. A complicated history worth noting -- worth its own thread really.)

2022-06-12 at 02:07:04: So the Mass is a re-presentation of each of those three moments individually, and of the collective multi-day story-event that connects and surrounds them, and of Jesus himself as Incarnate God, as an offering loosely in the style of 2nd Temple altar-sacrifice-worship.

2022-06-12 at 02:07:04: 'The event' is the Triduum. It's defined by three moments in particular: when Jesus institutes the Eucharist on Holy Thursday, when he dies and descends to Hell on Good Friday, and when he rises embodied from the dead as the Vigil night turned to cock-crow o'clock Paschal Sunday.

2022-06-12 at 02:07:04: Each Mass is technically the same event being re-presented in separate place-times; there is a kind of link back to the place-times the event first happened.

2022-06-12 at 02:07:03: The metaphysics of the Mass are some of my favorite things to play with. I'm gonna share some about one of my hyperfixations: 🧵 https://t.co/Ax01sxuFS5

2022-06-10 at 20:20:13: I used to really dislike the Sun as a kid but when I got older I got more and more appreciative of sunlight on my skin and light in my eyes -- and the bursting green brilliance of plants dominating the landscape in the light of the summer Sun. Love me a southeast-corner room now.

2022-06-10 at 20:20:13: I guess Luna has always been Luna for me, huh? Nights running through the field behind my house, howling up at that beautiful, lifeless orb. I'd pray to her. Strong association with the BVM for me, but usually not identification. They belong to each other.

2022-06-10 at 01:09:00: Because if I look at it in terms of "getting the apartment clean," it took *way* too long. But call it "Learning, for the first time, how to manage the cycles of keeping a living-space clean and organized and functional in a sustainable way" and that feels more worth the journey.

2022-06-10 at 01:08:59: Partner didn't make that mess on her own, an old meta/roomie of hers definitely helped. But most of the mess did pre-date my coming around. This is the cleanest it's been since then, and the sudden absence of all that psychic pressure is. . . frustrating.

2022-06-10 at 01:08:59: I grew up in a house where my room was clean and the rest of the house was dirty. I had decades of experience ignoring all of the mess I don't tolerate in my own space. But of course that's meant that this apartment hasn't felt like my space, because it's been so messy.

2022-06-03 at 23:00:04: My first instinct is "way less," just given how media-saturated we are, but I'd like to be wrong, because that seems like it'd more interesting. My second guess is "still less, but not as less as I might've thought?"

(Similar questions around "how many stories do you know?")

2022-06-03 at 23:00:04: times? Like we've had quite a bit of character saturation since books became accessible, but what about before then? Well we still had plays and poems, music, dreams, myths, games, stories...But did the average person in given place have *as* many characters? More even? Way less?

2022-06-03 at 23:00:03: I wonder what the total number of characters I've encountered in a book/movie/show/play/poem/etc is, and what that number looks like generally in various places and times. It feels normal to have thousands of little constructs floating in deep memory but what about in ancient

2022-06-03 at 13:57:38: @0bviouSquirre1 Casual discussions about whether or not I exist are exhausting. Especially in the face of shit like my state trying to ban HRT til *25*. And forced outings of trans kids by fascists.

And so much ignorance on gender and sex justified for specious reasons. Also exhausting.

2022-06-02 at 15:49:21: @taalumot I think it's easy for an ex-C*tholic to think the ch*rch was influential on the US, that is the propaganda we were fed. Still. Too much to go into replies but I feel like RCC gets ignored in places it deserves much blame; in US, the cat-prot divide was oft more veil than wall.

2022-06-02 at 15:36:58: @taalumot RCC-in-US just generally not given enough blame, imo, for what is often blamed solely on p*rit*nism+ev*ngel*calism inUS. Eg: I'll hear people try and say that Ev*ng's influence is reason why RCC-in-US is way more prolife than in other nations, but I think that's overly simplified

2022-06-02 at 15:19:38: @taalumot Feels accurate, but also like C*tholics are getting off too easy...

2022-06-01 at 15:23:40: That's actually maybe the hardest for me to intuitively internalize: The mistakes that come from loving myself too much, while real, hurt *everyone* *way* less than the mistakes I make from self-doubt/self-loathing/self-sabotage. Latter just easier for me to ignore my agency.

2022-06-01 at 15:23:40: I used to actually genuinely love myself, and I got scared out of it because that energy pushed me away from so much that was comfortable. But now I know how much I needed that push. Could have trusted myself. Could again. Should again, actually, best for everyone.

2022-06-01 at 15:23:39: Feeling a need to worry that I'm repressing my flaws to hide them *is part of the repression strategy.* Distract myself looking for what's in plain sight so I can stop looking at it for a while. Might even be true s/t but even then actually focusing on it doesn't usually rly help

2022-06-01 at 15:23:39: Ok actually, my 'biggest problem' is that I've come to largely identify myself as a list of things waiting to grow and problems blocking that growth. I'm actually p cool as-is, nor are my flaws that exceptional. I belong already. I don't have to earn that.

2022-06-01 at 14:33:29: I'm getting a lot more confidence that I'll get to where I'll be able to resolve these heretofore intractable patterns into something better, but rn it feels like backburnering then while learning about upstream problems is the move.

This may be a distraction? Lesson if so.

2022-06-01 at 14:33:29: I prolly wouldn't have even let myself try it for just one day until more recently. "Perfection or bust!"-- especially if "or bust" prolly means I can self-pity and change nothing!

I love the idea of forcing a change in myself. But I hate being forced to do anything, even by me.

2022-06-01 at 14:33:28: Kept my phone put away in a desk drawer yesterday. Which mostly just led to me being on my computer a lot instead *but that is actually better,* because I was in front of a keyboard and it was easier to flit around, so I did more writing, maintenance, and engaged research.
