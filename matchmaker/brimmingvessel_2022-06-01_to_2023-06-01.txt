2023-05-31 at 20:48:45: at least this painful thing that happened to me is catalyzing reaching out to and relying on my friends 🤍

2023-05-31 at 19:25:16: @danielbrottman oh this sounds fun haha

2023-05-31 at 19:17:37: @marshmarigold very much so! my mom had the stellar suggestion of sending her a message laying out how she violated our agreement &amp; took advantage of me - once i have whatever $ she is planning to pay back

2023-05-30 at 23:27:07: ah might have to go to the haight st goodwill today!

2023-05-30 at 22:13:18: returning from memorial day weekend away. what stands between me and being at home is several more stops on the train and then a 20 min walk home luggin my big ol bag. a warm cup of cacao and lying on the floor with my cat sound real nice rn

2023-05-30 at 20:08:29: also they have a wide toe box @danielbrottman !!!

2023-05-30 at 20:08:12: gonna go for a forest hike/run one of these days, can’t wait to see how the terrain feels w the grippy outsole

2023-05-30 at 20:05:30: bought my first pair of fancy zero drop trail running shoes hehe

2023-05-29 at 22:02:52: hi how’s everyone’s weekend been?

2023-05-29 at 01:55:37: this weekend feels like what our life woulda been like if i moved to LA two years ago

2023-05-28 at 04:48:01: wanna make heartfelt but extremely danceable music

2023-05-28 at 01:57:41: @marshmarigold AH i was between the right answer and the wrong answer for starbucks and i shoulda gone w my initial guess

2023-05-27 at 22:46:42: feelin like da luckiest girl in da world getting to see my boyf two weekends in a row

2023-05-27 at 21:48:28: On my way! to LA to see @braidsmusic tonight :D

2023-05-27 at 19:20:23: @yokaihainen :( i’m sorry friend, that’s fucked :(

2023-05-27 at 11:19:31: did it! finished the draft of the thing, scheduled emails to be sent at 8am to the two profs who need it. whew am i delirious but yaaay what a weight off my shoulders

2023-05-27 at 09:29:41: is the spirit of barbara mcclintock here with us now 🧐🌱 https://t.co/huGfoxK7S7

2023-05-27 at 09:27:54: i’ve been writing about single molecule imaging for the past 2-3 hours 🫠😌

2023-05-27 at 09:27:10: don’t get me wrong i still wanna keep doing human/mammalian cell work, but bacteria are wild. the diversity of bacteria boggles the mind, each species a unique manifestation of Life

2023-05-27 at 09:25:18: hope i get to retvrn to bacterial work at some stage, that’s where it all started for me

2023-05-27 at 05:50:21: @veggiebat_ what’s in ~amber/brown bottles??

2023-05-27 at 04:12:41: also maybe time for a re-read of dis https://t.co/GKdDSVRslx

2023-05-27 at 04:09:37: might do a ritual after dinner invoking my science role models 😌🙃

2023-05-27 at 04:07:15: would be cool if i could incorporate to scientist/biology part of my identity too some how

(reminded of @n_of_oneness’s legendary tryptamine (i think) halloween costume…)

2023-05-27 at 04:05:49: going to a regional burn in ~2 weeks, want to put together a fun costume or two! some crochet, otherwise just assembling pieces however the vision requires

so! y’all have any ideas for me? as a starter i think embodying a hindu deity could be v cool…

2023-05-27 at 02:55:30: bf says for him it often feels good to work when one is “not supposed to” so i am going to channel that subversive energy!!! i &lt;3 bein subversive

2023-05-27 at 02:18:46: trying to “romanticize my life” here. i mean, staying in and pondering my niche of biology, pontificating and doing some digging i think could be quite gratifying and also in alignment with my dharma

2023-05-27 at 02:17:05: i am pretty close to convincing myself that staying in this friday night and immersing myself in science &amp; letting my mind have time and spaciousness to do the work i must do… is the right thing to do. esp since i’m jetting off to LA tomorrow afternoon for a fun wknd w bf!

2023-05-27 at 02:11:41: i am asking, nicely, to be possessed

2023-05-27 at 01:26:00: my skin is freakin out (mildly but more than usual) from the pizza i had yesterday aha

2023-05-26 at 18:19:28: campus yesterday (if only i felt as studious now as i did then) https://t.co/Z3VStVsLZA

2023-05-26 at 16:11:04: @TheGrandBlooms probably some truth to what you’re saying, i think i had a knee jerk response to reply because it felt like it minimized my OP (rest of thread articulates *my* definitions of conv/div thinking in this specific context)

2023-05-26 at 16:06:59: @TheGrandBlooms certainly divergent/convergent thinking is in play in other aspects of life. eg i’m reminded of cycles i go through with hobbies - “i wanna do all of them” (div) —&gt; sometimes leads to overwhelm, “ok let’s try this one thing for a bit” (conv)

2023-05-26 at 16:01:10: @TheGrandBlooms doesnt ring true for me and my set of experiences - preparing for this exam is helping me rein in divergent thinking in a way that feels novel &amp; special &amp; meaningful for me

2023-05-25 at 23:08:52: actually we’re gonna let “everybody wants to rule the world” by tears for fears run its radio course first

2023-05-25 at 23:06:55: a trip to the east bay wouldn’t be complete w/o bumpin darude sandstorm (from cd) in my humble prius. windows down letting the sun and breeze in, cruisin around the calm streets

2023-05-25 at 22:47:25: that has its implications for how people interact with me in the world but in general i love being a woman

2023-05-25 at 22:47:24: pondering in trader joe’s: is gender a system i feel comfortable with because it “serves me”? 

i don’t have too much friction w gender, some pain i’ve worked through wrt being female &amp; in my body; bottom line my energy feels dominantly feminine and my body matches that &amp;

2023-05-25 at 21:54:09: where we bring the ideas divergent thinking has generated back to reality, back to practice - and move closer to answering those scientific questions (which satisfies the bubbly curiosity of divergent thinking)

2023-05-25 at 21:54:08: divergent thinking tickles my scientific curiosity, but i can get distracted and hopeless if i don’t engage in

convergent thinking - like writing my aims and hypotheses. what are the specific questions *i* want to answer? also like experimental planning -

2023-05-25 at 21:50:46: realizing: getting ready for my qualifying exam is training in fluidly transitioning between convergent &amp; divergent thinking

2023-05-25 at 21:47:55: periodic reminder that if we are friends on here and you are an inst*gram user i would like to also be friends on there (dm me!)

2023-05-25 at 19:03:25: walking up n down euclid now in search of a place to eat, remembering the time boyf was deep in a “should i quit phd?” mini-crisis period. we met with a berkeley phd student over lunch at a sandwich place on euclid, and he strongly advised bf to just push through

2023-05-25 at 18:47:14: love coming here tho it’s always a portal to a younger version of myself

summer 2019 was first time visiting the campus, on a roadtrip with boyf, 3 days into dating :~)
truly an “i’m in california!!” moment
and since then many milestones/sub-eras have happened

2023-05-25 at 17:54:28: berkeley campus soooo quiet w/o undergrads

2023-05-25 at 04:14:33: @FractalAuth ahhh! that is rough ❤️‍🩹

2023-05-25 at 03:25:25: dont feel like working on work stuff yet so im gonna set a 20min timer and peruse book club book

2023-05-25 at 00:38:32: starting my mandated 1-2.5h chill. much needed after my second and final practice exam this afternoon (snippet of whiteboard below) which went on the whole good but just is challenging emotionally https://t.co/DmZ0u0tOTf

2023-05-24 at 04:43:36: added cardamom &amp; honey :)

2023-05-23 at 02:19:49: other conceptions i’ve felt of god/divinity: 

• loving awareness as fundamental substrate, just have to tap into non-separateness and that’s healing
• oneness with what you’re doing / flow states
• creation - puts you in contact w creative power bigger than yourself

2023-05-23 at 02:17:59: a loose set of thoughts:

who is _your_ god?

how can i engage with hinduism in a way that feels right to me?
(tired of forcing myself in some ways, sadness of falling out of enchantment)

in a way my pursuit of biology is a way i reach for god

2023-05-23 at 02:10:36: (b) is lookin more possible as of late with my recent dj-ing explorations &amp; forest explorations. have to find good speakers - decent sound/bass, ideally rechargeable, connect via wires to dj controller, carry-able on a slight hike to party spot 😇🌿

2023-05-23 at 02:08:36: two types of events i aspire to host are (a) small dinners and (b) small raves

2023-05-22 at 23:53:55: @teleosistem i’m arriving at a similar frame of: if i write for myself i think it’ll be worthwhile, satisfy that inner calling, contribute to development/deepening of some sort.

best of luck with your meditation writing endeavors!

2023-05-22 at 23:52:10: @teleosistem there’s something there, a vein to be tapped into, but if i frame it as writing for others i have some ick around it. like i don’t want to surface these things in a way thats like… performing trauma for an audience. but i also want to be vulnerable &amp; dive deep! &amp;…

2023-05-22 at 23:50:38: @teleosistem &gt; hard time motivating myself to write things for others but if I write it for myself and my own development I just might do it

this articulates something i’ve been feeling abt writing abt my experiences w childhood illness -

2023-05-20 at 05:52:33: yeah long distance generally not ideal but i do love the little ritual of getting dolled up before pickin babe up from airport 🥰💄✨🛫🌿

2023-05-20 at 02:14:00: @willlowthewhisp didn’t know you lived in oakland! associate you so strongly with canada haha

2023-05-19 at 23:38:28: @impartialpim curious what kind of “bad” u were at physics

2023-05-19 at 23:38:14: @impartialpim physics was always something i was curious about but i could never learn it the way it was taught in my ugrad… in grad school im coming back to it in a way that feels orthogonal and non-linear but also *right* for me (studying physics-y things in cells)

2023-05-19 at 18:30:44: @marshmarigold heck yeah

2023-05-19 at 01:06:03: @meridians_ &gt; the key I found is to plan something I will enjoy no matter what outcome

what a handy insight! thank you for your reply, it helped me feel more at peace

2023-05-19 at 01:04:06: life’s just one long bender

2023-05-19 at 01:04:05: some forest for my dear twitter people 🌿💚🌱 https://t.co/2dk3xD1Ule

2023-05-19 at 00:56:07: got to office but sadness swelled so big i felt i had to get out so i went to the forest and man did the forest soothe my soul

2023-05-18 at 22:30:21: hosting things takes a certain resilience huh - trying to host a thing saturday, the people i’ve invited thus far haven’t been responsive and i am trying not to take it personally 🙃

2023-05-18 at 19:01:07: remembering compassion towards myself when i feel disconnected from the divine

2023-05-17 at 20:42:55: my new favorite “street” in sf is oakhurst lane

2023-05-17 at 19:57:45: i don’t know exactly how it will feel but i think there’s a good chance i’ll like it

2023-05-17 at 19:57:05: i wanna get a snake stencil and use the henna i already have to give myself a temporary snake on my arm!

2023-05-17 at 03:39:23: @marshmarigold u better get paid 😤

2023-05-17 at 03:37:30: festival top prototype in progress :D ☀️ https://t.co/Y9YJHwR7iM

2023-05-16 at 20:11:23: i low key love lab meeting though… if i’m in a good headspace i’m great at being the center of attention and thinking on my feet and keeping things lighthearted but also alive. lab meeting is also an experience of being part of hive mind/collective conscious so thaaats sick

2023-05-16 at 20:04:04: @vlct0rs_tw1tter 💛💛 i love phd student life, i love that this is a thing i get to push myself to do because it just feels so right for me

2023-05-16 at 19:43:26: this morning i lightly oiled my hair with coconut oil and a little bit of thyme oil, then put my hair into two braids, and let me just say i look, feel, and smell fantastic hehe

2023-05-16 at 18:21:19: currently i feel anxiety in my chest and it makes me feel a little bit like i’m dying

2023-05-16 at 18:20:42: for 2 hours this afternoon i will be explaining my proposed research to my lab via drawing on the whiteboard, and will be fielding questions from every angle 😀🤪😅😎😌

2023-05-16 at 02:35:40: on the market for a very good review paper on membrane lipid biosensors

2023-05-15 at 00:46:34: when i get home, gonna lay out my groceries and write out a meal plan for the upcoming week :) will also get some quinoa going

2023-05-14 at 18:16:43: anybody have a lentil “meatloaf” kinda recipe they like?

2023-05-14 at 18:06:02: time to make myself eat some fuckin food

2023-05-14 at 08:54:45: i missed the first half but i had some lively conversation and made new friends!!! :))

2023-05-14 at 06:10:54: pulling up to party, don’t know if i am too late, we will see

2023-05-14 at 06:00:14: at the airport a few days ago, i was on on phone with bf speaking emphatically about being present for our future kids and ahh do i love envisioning the future and feeling it deep within. middle aged man gave me a strange look lol

2023-05-14 at 05:53:27: if u join just say hi and i’ll hop on :~)

2023-05-14 at 05:52:15: https://t.co/it3lsINSdb

2023-05-14 at 05:25:28: sooo proud &amp; pleased with myself, just put in 2.5 hours of work into some writing i have to do for phd stuffs &amp; sent off the updated version to the prof i’m meeting with on monday :) was considering putting this off to tomorrow but ah how nice to be done (for now)!

😌📚✍🏽🙏🏽☺️

2023-05-13 at 16:37:49: yesterday when i was extremely nauseous after a long night &amp; bc of the substances in my body — i was coming back into my body - most comforting thing was to lay my forehead and hands on my cat’s body. and then my body awareness only existed at our contact points

2023-05-13 at 16:36:04: ketamine is so strange it’s dissociative and somewhat disembodying but in the wake of last night’s experience i’m feeling more aware of my body in an interesting way

2023-05-13 at 07:14:17: @powerbottomdad1 meeee

2023-05-13 at 06:32:24: @veggiebat_ did ketamine for first time in a while was interesting now i’m at tail end but still spacey but mostly nauseous

2023-05-12 at 20:32:05: as of late this week i’m finally starting to feel excited about my qualifying exam next month. yesterday i was writing in my notebook, laying ideas out, and felt a warmth in my chest - felt an internal assurance that i would pass the exam :) 💗

2023-05-12 at 20:07:47: @nopranablem yes!!! 💗

2023-05-12 at 19:59:16: the way loving you brings me closer in contact with my dharma! ❤️‍🔥

2023-05-12 at 19:58:00: i pass dolores park on my commute every day! life is sweet

2023-05-12 at 19:19:26: have any of you successfully hacked a coin operated laundry situation? if so i may need you to transmit ur wisdom

2023-05-12 at 17:17:15: might also watch some youtube videos to learn basics of mixing techno, and practice w a few tracks. i’ve been having fun playing around but now i want some instruction/technique

2023-05-12 at 16:50:13: @KnotGrigori oh i love that for him! cigars were smoked at his bday party last weekend (at sunset) and that was a lovely time. i’ll see him next weekend and the one after 😛😄💕

2023-05-12 at 16:45:02: somehow, through the tides of life, a song i haven’t worked on since last june has resurfaced and my heart is very happy and taken with this pursuit. i love this portal of connecting to my past self 🥺 and expressing my energy thru somethin creative!!!

2023-05-12 at 16:28:14: also have to locate my passport 😬

2023-05-12 at 16:28:05: alright y’all i’m calling it, my wild friday night plans are to clean my frickin room. clutter has built up &amp; i have to create order/properly organize after moving last month. the physical clutter has reached a threshold in affecting mental clutter 📚🪑😫🪞⛲️

2023-05-12 at 03:21:08: @veggiebat_ teehee

2023-05-12 at 01:47:07: @veggiebat_ :’) 💘

2023-05-12 at 01:46:52: @s0ulDirect0r shorter term might take my controller to festival i’m goin to in early june :’)

2023-05-12 at 01:46:13: @s0ulDirect0r one slightly longer term vision is to dj at hot springs for last night of an annual science retreat in september hehehe

2023-05-11 at 19:46:00: @FractalAuth 😊🤲🏽🙏🏽💗

2023-05-11 at 18:59:43: @marshmarigold YUP

2023-05-11 at 18:54:04: playing around with two tracks - one with vocals n beats, one primarily beats. sometimes they sound really good together! sometimes you hear them going from one cohesive track to two distinct voices https://t.co/EsXt02gBIY

2023-05-11 at 18:41:52: @nat_sharpe_ freshly baked bread, freshly sliced n buttered, still warm!

2023-05-11 at 18:41:30: @nat_sharpe_ oh hell yeah love it ty nat!

2023-05-11 at 18:01:21: @kyzcralotSxaM she likened the promise she was asking me for to the promises my dad made when leaving india for the US - promises he made to his parents and to himself, to uphold his identity &amp; honor his roots

2023-05-11 at 17:59:05: @kyzcralotSxaM when i was younger i wanted a white/western name tho! lolol. in middle/early high school i asked my mom if i could legally change my name to teresa and she had a serious sit down convo with me where she asked me to promise her i wouldn’t change my name

2023-05-11 at 17:57:46: @kyzcralotSxaM yessss i feel like i’ve grown into it and it really does feel like the prettiest n most fitting name for who i am in this life. reminds me of a flowing, clear creek

2023-05-11 at 07:46:40: @Childermass4 uffff i’m so tempted but it would be a heck of a journey and i’ve never been to europe before!!! i also should probably not travel more than the plans i already have for that time of year 🥲 will u be doing again next summer??

2023-05-11 at 07:13:08: @Childermass4 yes hahaha i just kept goin n goin n goin, more kept arising and feeling constructive and connected. by the end i had to stop not because i had fully emptied myself but just cuz i was getting worn out!

2023-05-11 at 07:01:53: givin myself the cutest gf award 🥇

2023-05-11 at 06:53:24: @nat_sharpe_ ohooo yes pls

2023-05-11 at 06:33:42: @christineist yay! well a week or so ago bf mentioned a slightly older friend he views as role model. was thinking of such friends in my life and you are one! i find the way you engage with ur emotions fascinating &amp; i admire how you’re always doin things and channeling ur energy

2023-05-11 at 06:24:08: @pratibimbana fo sho multiple such decisions. one big one was moving cross country for a job on a week’s notice a few years ago. parents didn’t quite know how to orient towards it but mom said my astrology chart said i was kama oriented so she had to let me follow my intuition &amp; go

2023-05-11 at 06:10:17: @veggiebat_ big asynchronous haircut day! christine and me too! $19 at great clips 😌 https://t.co/f6kVR6ARIs

2023-05-11 at 06:00:49: holy fuck 8306 words

2023-05-11 at 04:22:23: will poast word count when i get home

2023-05-11 at 04:22:01: i may have just spent 4.5-5 hours of my flight journaling and intensely reflecting in my notes app what of it

2023-05-11 at 04:21:04: @nickcammarata can’t wait for the formal dining room meditation space &amp; in general to see how y’all occupy a HAUS! a castle, i mean haha

2023-05-11 at 04:19:44: @nickcammarata omg yesssssss! castle is happening! 🏰 excited for you guys 💗

2023-05-10 at 22:13:05: @responsiblparty thank you luke! do any handmade presents of note come to mind for you, either that you’ve given or received?

2023-05-10 at 22:12:23: @marshmarigold thank you!! canadian boyf will insist on calling it a toque… 😬 i refuse to give in 😑😂

2023-05-10 at 22:10:47: @meridians_ 🥰💚

2023-05-10 at 22:10:29: @veggiebat_ thank you!!! this lighting doesn’t even do it justice - it’s this kettle dyed yarn sourced from uruguay, when i worked with it the yarn had a lovely faint gradient from pale yellow to bright dark orange 💛🧡

2023-05-10 at 22:07:56: @br___ian also curious what kinda headphones u personally use. how much of an audiophile are u? 🧐

2023-05-10 at 22:07:20: @ElodesNL @br___ian 59k headphones?!!!

2023-05-10 at 20:57:22: stiff upper lip (as the bottom one trembles)

2023-05-10 at 01:37:18: @responsiblparty i been reflecting n living my relationship to cannabis too, more ups n downs since we last chatted :’)

2023-05-10 at 01:36:36: @responsiblparty interesting - what kinda grieving? grieving what?

2023-05-09 at 18:18:40: god willing 🧿

2023-05-09 at 18:04:32: @vals_pals_ not a direct response but i love bio “relentlessly mining my emotions” - feels v true and reflective of u

2023-05-09 at 18:02:17: long distance relationship as distortion of time. these last months seem like an eternity stretching forward, the years we’ve spent apart feel like forever, and yet we have the rest of a life together awaiting us

2023-05-09 at 14:50:03: @AnneSelke ah i’m having a similar feeling visiting hometown in east coast US! grateful SF / the west coast is my home. i like your follow-up line of thinking - though i’m not there, i’m having an immensely difficult time imagining coming back here haha

2023-05-08 at 17:38:59: @meridians_ awh lovely - may you have a wonderful retreat 🤍

2023-05-08 at 17:37:13: i’ve only read a quarter of glass bead game but one message i deeply appreciate from it is: along the path of listening to &amp; finding your calling, experiencing angst is natural &amp; even beautiful

2023-05-07 at 21:25:03: @veggiebat_ where ya headed?

2023-05-06 at 11:03:33: @embryosophy made it!!! 🙏🏽

2023-05-06 at 02:28:47: @embryosophy any good supportive vibes sent my way would be appreciated i am a little stressed!

2023-05-06 at 02:28:08: @embryosophy uhhhhh i’m heading home from happy hour/celebrations with colleagues to pack rapidly, move my car, and get to SFO in time for an 11pm flight!

2023-05-05 at 17:46:27: i’m sure some disillusionment will happen but my major “concern” with being a phd student is not that i will become jaded but that i will fall deeply in love with academia

2023-05-05 at 17:27:14: @meridians_ as i advance in my scientific career i’m interacting with more men who fit that description, and i have to be good about boundaries so i can enjoy connecting deeply about research without my brain auto-completing and thinking “am i into this person???”

2023-05-05 at 17:24:53: @meridians_ hehe true. more context: i’m building a life with a wonderful man who fits that description; and i largely liked the reality of academic lives/values i saw growing up. both my parents were academics - this allowed them flexibility so someone could always be home for kids

2023-05-05 at 15:52:24: (this was my first time spending hours with it and finally starting to have fun! the headphones cue-ing isn’t working yet, so limits my ability to make sure things sound ok before layering new track)

2023-05-05 at 05:06:15: behold i stood before my dj controller for a few hours this evening and here i what i have to offer u https://t.co/wmJgL7yUDj

2023-05-05 at 01:37:39: so grateful for the extra bone broth my housemate makes on a regular basis!

2023-05-05 at 00:51:26: i so hungies

2023-05-05 at 00:00:22: RT @eshear: @this_is_silvia just one more layer man, one more...i'm almost done clinging...let me just surrender one more layer, i promise

2023-05-03 at 18:02:31: either way the sun and the clouds affect all manner of living beings - especially plants - and i am a living being too so it is only natural i am affected by sunlight or lack thereof

2023-05-03 at 18:01:35: but then i thought of how clouds bring about peace in bf and sadness/slowness in me - we wonder if it has to do with his ancestors hailing from the shores of devon &amp; mine from the indian subcontinent 🌊⛈️/☀️🥭

2023-05-03 at 17:59:04: sun came out when i went on walk to move my car (street cleaning). noticed my mood improving from the sun, then began to chastise self for “requiring sun to feel good”. imagined long term potential future in cloudy vancouver (bf and i imagine one pot’l future as ubc profs ☺️🤪)

2023-05-03 at 02:49:31: @allisonwilens for much of my childhood i only had 3 cousins, all of whom lived across the world and our families’ consequent cultural differences were too broad a gap to bridge :’) it would have been nice to have a close extended family, but c’est la vie

2023-05-02 at 05:22:33: just drove 265 miles in one sitting whew that was a lot i really needed a break

2023-05-01 at 23:36:38: this is helping the sadness in my chest https://t.co/zc2RBCneWr

2023-05-01 at 23:09:27: i was so motivated to drive the 6 hours down to my love…. now for the drive back 😭💔

2023-05-01 at 19:44:38: @christineist @Jeanvaljean689 @vincent_yc_li i'm compelled by the few pages you posted, and i think i may already have a copy at home

2023-04-30 at 16:39:17: @responsiblparty 😂🙏🏽

2023-04-30 at 16:22:09: @responsiblparty came across this song yesterday and loved it, immediately listened to it 3x. such a banger

2023-04-29 at 05:59:22: @cursedmargarita watchu wanna write?

2023-04-29 at 04:05:09: boyf n i rollin up to evening plans, we’re such a cute and dynamic duo 🥰

2023-04-29 at 00:20:58: hmmm i wanna see trends for pediatric cancer mortality https://t.co/N6k9PBco0M

2023-04-28 at 17:29:45: oh yeah https://t.co/fdLGDWCu7R https://t.co/TyLNaFLDNQ

2023-04-28 at 15:59:00: @embryosophy LA for my love’s birthday :) 🥰

2023-04-28 at 01:39:11: tomorrow morning i get to give into my escapist inclinations and hit the open road ~~~

2023-04-28 at 00:16:05: @cIass_man great idea/visualization, ty! :)

2023-04-28 at 00:15:45: @meridians_ lovely, thank you for sharing &lt;3

2023-04-27 at 21:03:06: @veggiebat_ you n your space n the sky — ART!

2023-04-27 at 20:51:01: happened to sit next to a 4th year in my phd program on the bus into work and we had a lovely little chat!

2023-04-27 at 20:21:08: anyone have guided meditation recs for healing / grounding? i’m trying to see how i can use my mind to mitigate my uterus’s decision to freak out

2023-04-27 at 19:59:58: @viriditax 😂 glad ya asked. https://t.co/rUjuEIuEd7

2023-04-27 at 19:02:08: ummmm i’m drinking iron water and my sensory clarity is increasing, with a slight delay (5-10 min) after consumption

2023-04-26 at 18:44:48: @er1enney0ung oh eri i adore u

2023-04-26 at 18:42:28: called dad on drive over bay bridge, we talked about how the mind is like the wind &amp; how it likes to race; and how to shift my mind from the “worry lane” over to the “work lane” via all sorts of things but mainly exercise &amp; meditation

2023-04-26 at 16:17:11: high off three shots of the gum numbing stuff at the dentist 💉

2023-04-25 at 21:01:46: @meridians_ @veggiebat_ thank you shannon 💗☺️

2023-04-25 at 20:45:38: @veggiebat_ i could use some; i’ve been feelin a lil stuck in the boiler room this week… so much to do, so much to look forward to, so much i’m scared of https://t.co/VOsWm5YWgH

2023-04-25 at 02:37:17: about to meet a friend i haven’t seen since 2017! :o

2023-04-24 at 18:10:04: saturday night i drove back alone from a bonfire on muir beach to the city. i had the distinct sense that a version of myself from not so long ago would have found the twisty roads scary but instead i observed myself handling them with cool focus and tremendous peace of mind

2023-04-24 at 02:45:24: @myceliummage assimilating scientific knowledge whilst reading a paper is often a fun experience &amp; involves me intentionally taking deep breaths. other times i’m just tingly from the novelty of ideas presented &amp; the way the ideas sparkle with promise of interconnection

2023-04-24 at 02:43:44: @viriditax wow this is the energy i’m aspiring towards

2023-04-24 at 00:23:03: @AdamInProgress hmmm “mahadasha” is also coming to mind, idk if relevant

2023-04-24 at 00:22:15: @AdamInProgress i’ve heard of rahu and ketu but don’t really know what’s going on with them - could you explain the basic idea / offer a slice of what makes them so fascinating to u?

2023-04-22 at 17:02:24: @responsiblparty not from you specifically, i didn’t know the meme format and assumed that parental angle would come from a not excited/ready to chastise or “catch in the act” perspective

2023-04-22 at 16:57:30: @responsiblparty aw wow this is more wholesome and kind than i expected 🥹

2023-04-22 at 16:14:28: @DaltonDEmery first bit of this page is a book excerpt i think of in this territory - https://t.co/gpDNgxsQYl

2023-04-22 at 16:12:42: @DaltonDEmery i like “symbolic sight”

2023-04-22 at 16:11:05: wistful for the sun and company of my love in san luis obispo

2023-04-22 at 15:30:09: @sandseron1 @responsiblparty i was at a party being hosted in my house! (but i had gone to two science happy hours before that)

2023-04-22 at 15:29:39: @sandseron1 @responsiblparty no haha personally i probably wouldn’t mix alcohol and psytrance

2023-04-22 at 15:09:36: i got some exercise and fresh air ☀️
when i get home i’m gonna put the kettle on then wash my face and brush my teeth. then i’m gonna hydrate and eat a tasty, fatty breakfast. 
i will put my phone to charge and pack my hiking bag for the afternoon!
6 mi 2000ft up hike w friends…

2023-04-22 at 15:05:38: @sympatheticopp dang…

2023-04-22 at 15:04:40: reality distortion: i feel bad -&gt; subconscious belief “i am bad”

i feel bad because i am bad
this creates shame

when in reality there could be any number of internal or external things making u feel bad, many within ur control to act on fairly easily!

2023-04-22 at 14:18:26: @responsiblparty it sounds like a familiar format but i can’t think of the original thing! 😂😭

2023-04-22 at 14:15:34: @responsiblparty lololol just noticed tweet said “son”, not “so”

2023-04-22 at 14:15:14: @responsiblparty no, now i’m mildly hungover and up early as my body tends to do after alcohol - out for a walk

2023-04-22 at 03:22:40: confession: i am actually pretty cool

2023-04-22 at 03:20:01: since moving to the city i’ve been drawn to dressing in more lively, colorful clothes and ahh i love that! affirms my own vitality, life force energy

2023-04-22 at 03:17:08: i looove living in the city! it’s nice to be back after spending some time away

2023-04-21 at 22:08:45: @parakeetnebula immediately recalled simpsons seafood buffet episode

2023-04-21 at 22:07:22: it's also nice to read a math textbook authored by a woman. it makes me feel like, i can do this too. i read a little about the prof who authored those books. she seems great. i can't wait to feel her love in the pages and in her explanations

2023-04-21 at 22:02:34: in all seriousness i came across these books today and i'm the exact right target audience (biologist, scarred-by-maths &amp; yet still maths-curious)

2023-04-21 at 22:00:07: if u need me at the party tonight i'll be doing math in my room https://t.co/ewX7fE43eY

2023-04-21 at 16:41:54: @marshmarigold that makes a lot of sense. sending you strength, patience, n peace as things work themselves out

2023-04-21 at 16:40:50: @marshmarigold looks so yummy! what a nice plate of lunch!

2023-04-21 at 02:30:27: why’s my body craving starches so much! haha 🥔

2023-04-21 at 01:46:02: two wolves inside of me: (1) stay in and crochet at home, have cozy dinner with housemates; (2) yearning for an experience like psytrance at dna lounge

2023-04-21 at 01:43:43: ahhh yes i found a video tutorial! gonna go for a walk to get bubble tea then will come home n give it a try! the end goal is a hair band :D https://t.co/Z5qKMbkpeS

2023-04-21 at 01:41:39: i want to crochet this pattern so badly but this pattern diagram is all greek to me! https://t.co/AgjG0eT3Ye

2023-04-21 at 01:31:20: spotted in the mission and stopped me in my tracks ahaha iykyk https://t.co/nUgtiSPxz9

2023-04-21 at 01:29:15: @ulkar_aghayeva i could meet ya sometime may 2-5 and/or potentially provide a couch for a night or two

2023-04-20 at 17:59:25: @christineist awwwh! 🥰💗🌿💧 ty!

2023-04-20 at 06:41:17: @christineist compliment!!

2023-04-20 at 06:33:58: @marshmarigold how u feelin about 26? optimistic?

2023-04-20 at 06:33:27: @marshmarigold aww :( hbd tho!!! hope it was a good one and u got everything u wanted

2023-04-20 at 06:28:19: @embryosophy what does that look like for u? :) i recall an olive oil tincture? or something like that? that sounds suuuuper nice

2023-04-20 at 06:21:06: so how u guys celebrating the international holiday tomorrow (today for most of u)

2023-04-20 at 06:19:49: hmm… it may be time for me to put on some ambient music, log off, and read a paperback

2023-04-19 at 20:40:19: @christineist kaleidoscope christine! https://t.co/4KB7E83Y9b

2023-04-19 at 20:29:09: @meridians_ what does coming out of the cave involve?

2023-04-19 at 20:28:29: sooo nice to be able to leave the house at like 1:05 and feel confident i’ll make it in by my 2pm meeting (before moving i had to leave the house at 12:10-12:15 to ensure i could make the same meeting!)

2023-04-19 at 20:03:44: about to get high off knowledge lfg https://t.co/AdnJ1yvIYn

2023-04-19 at 18:39:24: @meridians_ 🤍 Mori and I bid you a good mornin &amp; afternoon too https://t.co/0prbuIlkM2

2023-04-19 at 04:59:50: @myceliummage YUP feelin it that's wild

2023-04-19 at 03:07:36: from @xiexiexiexiex specifically

2023-04-19 at 03:06:49: j’ai besoin de bisous!!

2023-04-18 at 21:16:08: @AnneSelke one idea: alternative nostril breathwork! you only have to do 8-10 rounds to sink fairly deep into it (takes a couple min). i like the yogic purpose of this exercise, which is to balance the sun/moon energy in your body. the feeling of actively balancing urself is nice

2023-04-18 at 19:33:45: any thoughts on how to exist with the self-doubt / fear of failure that arises when you’re undertaking a big endeavor for the first time? like, can i even do this?

2023-04-18 at 18:35:23: after looking into this a bit &amp; practicing a little, what feels most important now is balancing length of breaths on left &amp; right sides - that's how you balance ida/pingala (moon/sun) energy

2023-04-18 at 18:33:28: @s0ulDirect0r alas i have to be "productive" and focus on workin on a deliverable, but putting out there that we seem to both be in the bay and i'd love to meet at some pt!

2023-04-18 at 07:36:35: @meridians_ i don’t at present but this question made me think of the silly will ferrell movie “eurovision” - it’s goofy and funny and i have warm memories of watching it with partner a few years ago and giggling lots. so let’s go with that

2023-04-18 at 06:27:22: @MasterTimBlais @PiquantParvenu @MaryZoso @gptbrooke 👀☺️ @the_wilderless https://t.co/ZOgXCCQd61

2023-04-18 at 03:44:13: biiiig mudita vibes n feels lately ☀️☺️

2023-04-18 at 01:01:01: @relic_radiation i’d be interested :)

2023-04-17 at 17:50:44: do you visualize ida and pingala nadis (left/right streams of energy)? (i remember vaguely being taught this once)

2023-04-17 at 17:50:27: how do u guys be doing ur nadi shodana / alternate nostril. how long is the inhale/exhale? do u hold breath in between?

2023-04-17 at 17:46:54: kool kool kool guess i’m gonna go see if anyone’s made videos on the electrostatics of cell membranes

2023-04-17 at 17:44:57: @veggiebat_ thank you for asking :) hehe

2023-04-17 at 17:44:48: @veggiebat_ transcendent kingdom by yaa gyasi! it’s about neuroscience phd student, child of immigrants, her relationship to faith &amp; reconciling faith &amp; science &amp; the deep suffering she’s been witness to

2023-04-17 at 03:19:53: practically, one major part of keeping my channel clear involves doing the tasks my life demands of me and kindly dismantling my fear-based avoidance patterns

2023-04-17 at 03:18:27: there is something bigger than me that yearns to move through me and be expressed. it is not my job now to choose what that energy becomes. rather, my task is to keep my channel clear so that larger thing can emerge

2023-04-17 at 03:15:01: something about reading fiction that rhymes with my own experiences makes some parts of me feel deeply seen &amp; heard

2023-04-17 at 02:40:39: feeling lately: the only thing that will save me from myself is connection with the Absolute

2023-04-17 at 01:25:38: gonna do a lil guided nsdr to replenish dopamine, then layer up n head to new grocery store to grab ingredients for instant pot moroccan lentil soup recipe

2023-04-16 at 23:51:49: many ways of directing energy outward,
eg

talking to another human

reading a fiction book, allowing that narrative to take precedence for a bit (inner image of flipping lens)

2023-04-16 at 23:49:49: oftentimes when i’m tending towards negative thoughts about myself/the future, i find it’s because i’ve become overly internally focused. directing energy outward helps

2023-04-16 at 23:22:30: @veggiebat_ YUS i was patiently waiting for ur appearance on there

2023-04-16 at 20:52:50: @marshmarigold hahaha definitely something i’m proud of

2023-04-16 at 20:45:57: @marshmarigold i’m girl but 5:04

2023-04-16 at 20:43:33: filed my state taxes, paid quarterly estimated taxes, ordered new glasses and prescription sunglasses (i’ve been putting this off for months!) 💪🏽☀️ now for some food and outside time

2023-04-16 at 19:54:13: @christineist perhaps i could give this a try for my qualifying exam prep :o

2023-04-15 at 17:28:46: @veggiebat_ done ♥️

2023-04-14 at 22:02:34: @PrinceVogel @natural_hazard amen

2023-04-14 at 22:00:33: @PrinceVogel ah! i'm sorry. i like to "like" liberally but i don't assign as much meaning to like/reply order. ik @natural_hazard has a thing where he wants to keep tweet # &gt; likes #. diff people have diff deals

2023-04-14 at 21:46:24: @veggiebat_ i want too!

2023-04-14 at 21:45:20: @PrinceVogel thank u for bringing sf one to my attention lol &amp; hope your event goes wonderfully!

2023-04-14 at 20:03:25: i frickin love biophysics! love that biology is my path to physics

2023-04-14 at 06:13:22: @algekalipso libertine eros fig!

2023-04-14 at 05:47:49: @veggiebat_ hehe thank you! 💗 much appreciated

2023-04-14 at 00:50:12: @the_wilderless i’ve been listening to this over the past few days and it’s helped dispel that vague shame / sense that “this is not good for me” by providing quite a lot of interesting objective information https://t.co/PLniRTx4Ci

2023-04-14 at 00:35:23: fun social weekend plans are coming together 🥰 also gripped by a desire to search for art in thrift stores - perhaps i’ll add that to the weekend plans!

2023-04-13 at 23:04:07: @marshmarigold coot

2023-04-13 at 23:03:43: nobody told me that when life got better i would gain a new worry - losing that which made life better. coveting the freshness and positivity and wanting it to last forever

2023-04-13 at 22:48:15: @marshmarigold my gut response: just talk to people more. esp people you feel safe around. when you talk to others you gain their vocabulary for things. you also practice articulating urself and get better through iteration

2023-04-13 at 22:28:38: getting a feeling from life that i’ve passed through some transition that needed to happen. like, the heavy lifting is done, you’ve made the change you needed to, now you can relax into this new life &amp; learn by being attentive to and present with its unfolding

2023-04-13 at 22:23:12: i love that the 5 koshas each have “maya” in their names. that we honor the goddess in each of those labels

2023-04-13 at 22:21:08: i love the compactness of my physical body (annamaya kosha)

2023-04-13 at 21:55:02: @yokaihainen brb finding u and liking posts

2023-04-12 at 17:58:29: to the east bay! 🚗•••✨

2023-04-12 at 05:21:36: twitter/bluesky tl was feelin too impersonal so i messaged two dear offline friends and i feel much better

2023-04-10 at 03:14:53: moving weekend is proving to be rewarding but far more exhausting than expected!

2023-04-10 at 02:47:28: 👀🙏🏽💕 https://t.co/exdsqL09Q4

2023-04-08 at 23:58:26: @bunbury_exe sick!!

2023-04-07 at 20:46:07: @FractalAuth @the_wilderless @embryosophy @s0ulDirect0r @nvpkp @myceliummage me too! :’)

2023-04-07 at 18:08:15: to be clear, work will continue, but i am moving this weekend &amp; my commute will be shorter!

2023-04-07 at 17:53:17: last time doing my 1h15 commute in to work!

2023-04-07 at 00:51:26: @veggiebat_ oo mid june is right after my qualifying exam… maybe i could justify a trip up to portland

2023-04-06 at 19:41:16: @RichardMCNgo hmm, i’m moving back to the city and feel oppositely - lots of potential for close friendship, facilitated by geographical closeness &amp; potential for both fun &amp; mundane shared experiences

2023-04-05 at 18:24:56: @_StevenFan i felt this way when i tidied my room this weekend - but now i’m packing to move, a little day by day, and there’s always a mess somewhere or some progress to be made deconstructing my home 😭 it’ll be worth it though!

2023-04-05 at 16:36:46: think i’ll go work in the berkeley life sciences library this aft (have to return a bunch of books too)

2023-04-05 at 00:18:30: love this bookmark https://t.co/i9Sqh4w3dc

2023-04-05 at 00:07:07: RT @wholebodyprayer: Could we scale back the talk of universal love and scale up whatever it is we each need to love each individual person…

2023-04-04 at 03:07:09: a few weeks ago i discovered this khruangbin album, here is one of my fav songs from it: https://t.co/KnfytobpiN

2023-04-03 at 03:06:59: effortless flow state cooking tonight. blessed

2023-04-03 at 02:24:19: @veggiebat_ ur face here made me smile :)

2023-04-02 at 19:44:03: @ruth_hook_ waaaait is there a link?

2023-04-01 at 22:59:18: walking around lake merritt feeling like @christineist

2023-04-01 at 00:18:36: hm thinking about building life around what gets u sustainable dopamine hits

2023-03-31 at 19:45:02: alternatively stated: my experience of the world has gotten better since i stopped pathologizing my need for connection!

2023-03-31 at 19:42:55: i’m starting to become aware of what’s going on with my dopamine at any given time. i heard about the “dopamine wave pool” metaphor in a huberman podcast snippet yesterday - it’s super helpful

2023-03-31 at 19:00:31: me to me: guess what it's safe to seek connection! you're not being too much!

2023-03-31 at 17:19:36: looking forward to starting that after work today… my big work task for today is getting my proposal’s aims page drafted and to my advisor for our 2pm meeting 😭😅 i’ve got like a thousand words down just have to revise n refine now

2023-03-31 at 17:17:53: my big project for this weekend is decluttering &amp; organizing &amp; starting to pack for next weekend’s move!

2023-03-30 at 17:01:26: @flybottlemist hallo please divine my class good sir

2023-03-30 at 15:33:21: so what i’m hearing is… i have just about 2 weeks to get my first and likely only viral tweet? 👀😂

2023-03-30 at 15:10:32: first time waking up at 7am in a while and wow i missed spending time with myself like this. exist quietly, let my attention scan my surroundings and guide what i do next. all my tasks get done, but i don’t have many thoughts. music in the background is nice

2023-03-30 at 03:41:21: https://t.co/wrca6kfwps

2023-03-29 at 19:03:16: the mountains’ quiet majesty, british columbia https://t.co/8dMMzbyxO3

2023-03-29 at 18:32:06: @myceliummage would if i could!

2023-03-29 at 15:34:02: @__drewface design social environments to meet your needs &amp; "dropping the ball is part of playing the game" have been particularly helpful for me recently!

2023-03-29 at 05:12:03: hehehe i’m gonna start working on a bioinformatics side project at work i’m so stoked

2023-03-29 at 01:07:06: why would i force myself to be different when this is where my strength and joy lies?!

2023-03-29 at 01:05:55: i looove connecting with people. i love taking an interest in strangers, like the funny french family i ran into over lunch today, or the bus driver reading a book over her break. being warm and open to abundant connection is a state that feels so natural!

2023-03-29 at 01:03:17: i’m finding immense power in honoring my truth, that i do really love being around people

for a long while i thought that in order to “grow spiritually/personally”, i had to isolate myself. but there’s no need to force myself to be alone!

2023-03-28 at 20:03:59: turns out expressing my needs/feelings gently is an excellent way to get them addressed &amp; offers an opportunity for connection and resolution!

2023-03-28 at 19:39:07: ok kool https://t.co/gdaeo7aXsZ

2023-03-28 at 18:24:48: hallo from BART, it’s nice to be inside somewhere while it’s on and off pouring outside and mad windy. the train screeching on the tracks is always worst around 12/19th st oakland, and again partway through the under-the-bay stretch

2023-03-28 at 04:07:16: yeah well this is scarily accurate - not the esfj description but rather the cognitive function stack. https://t.co/ftlHPqr1Pl

2023-03-28 at 04:05:55: umm took mbti test for first time in many years and got esfj when before i'd always get infj

2023-03-28 at 02:14:51: i feel a greater acceptance towards myself, which enables me to weather the day’s challenges with grace and kindness i didn’t know i had. i feel like a kind radiant little being moving about spreading the light inside me

2023-03-28 at 02:11:48: after this weekend with partner &amp; his family i just feel so gosh darn good and secure in the world. upon returning to my normal life, i’m noticing i just wanna keep doing things! keep acting!

2023-03-27 at 21:07:11: @s0ulDirect0r :) it’s quite a journey! grateful for this 5 to 6 year long container for self-discovery, learning, and achieving mastery

2023-03-27 at 21:03:45: but yeah i’m sitting outside eating my lunch in short sleeves this is pretty fucking sweet

2023-03-27 at 21:03:16: sure feels nice to fly back home to sunny california after the cloudiness and mild chill of vancouver (which was lovely! got some quality time with bf’s fam 🥰)

2023-03-27 at 16:12:50: @s0ulDirect0r thank you! proposal is for my phd qualifying exam, in it i write about my research plans for the next year

2023-03-27 at 15:16:10: @s0ulDirect0r gm! flying back from vancouver, gotta send some emails, stop by work to take care of cells, go home n nap, read a couple papers and bang out a first draft of a proposal’s background &amp; aims page

2023-03-24 at 18:26:52: @evelynharlow_ what on earth is a placenta cake!

2023-03-23 at 19:50:38: love being in tissue culture room by myself cuz i can sing while working ☺️

2023-03-23 at 16:37:11: running taught me of the transience of emotions

2023-03-23 at 06:03:07: hi friends wassup with u

2023-03-23 at 01:37:29: @gptbrooke been holding this in the back of my head https://t.co/OIluH7ROxe

2023-03-23 at 01:36:39: @gptbrooke big same

2023-03-22 at 17:11:47: flow cytometry training day 3 at work today 😎 i love learning how to operate fancy machines

2023-03-22 at 03:00:30: i think as i sort out this loving myself unconditionally thing it will allow me to love you in the way you deserve to be loved

2023-03-22 at 02:58:48: https://t.co/3VF76U9Yus

2023-03-22 at 02:58:37: favs from tonight’s cookin n dancing:

2023-03-22 at 02:53:23: ah! just over 48 hours til i can melt into the warm embrace of my partner

2023-03-21 at 20:50:10: in my head this song is about japa yoga (chanting of sacred words) https://t.co/xVt3fsTHIS

2023-03-21 at 19:11:40: so i think i’m gonna try winding this hank of yarn into a ball once i board the bus… hopefully i can figure it out in 30 min haha

2023-03-21 at 18:57:17: found a $7 sweater yesterday that’s 70% lambs wool, 20% angora (rabbit wool!!) and 10% nylon! wearing it out today and i am so frickin cozy

2023-03-21 at 01:01:23: feels like it gives me permission to yearn for the kind of love &amp; closeness &amp; social interaction i desire (and work towards it) - instead of beating myself up about desiring it

2023-03-21 at 00:59:54: “I can take bigger risks when I'm loved, and spend much less time self-soothing” !! https://t.co/hqHooWZrrk

2023-03-21 at 00:14:11: got yarn! will have to manually wind it into balls. i should really make a gauge swatch before diving into the pattern…

2023-03-20 at 23:03:27: mid-afternoon field trip to the mission to buy some yarn, then back to lab. such is grad student life!

2023-03-20 at 18:54:30: @scrapbookhattie fuck, desire for billowy gingham dress ACTIVATED

2023-03-20 at 16:47:55: getting so stoked for this weekend’s trip to vancouver!

2023-03-20 at 03:44:27: grateful for khruangbin

2023-03-20 at 03:40:38: @choosy_mom 😅😅😅

2023-03-19 at 21:43:24: cracking up joyfully at the idea of lakshmi dating multiple gods and eventually being “truly domesticated” by vishnu. who knew goddesses could be so relatable https://t.co/LQzFsTosyC

2023-03-19 at 21:39:54: bruh so i keep seeing these guna-goddess associations:

lakshmi 🔸 rajas - activity
durga 🔸 tamas - negativity/inertia
saraswati 🔸 sattva - harmony

kinda interesting

2023-03-19 at 21:27:18: @donmexlar so tiny and delicate it made me shiver a lil when i finally saw the moon

2023-03-19 at 21:26:31: @tasshinfogleman very relatable sentiment https://t.co/iszXVkSuf7

2023-03-19 at 21:25:38: want her back 💔

2023-03-19 at 21:25:09: growing up and until recently, i thought my parents had named me for the goddess parvati. but my dad said in passing — we named you for durga

feels symbolic. the archetype i thought i was versus “who i really am”

2023-03-19 at 21:19:35: throwback to when my ego dissolved or at least became extremely malleable for 6 weeks last summer

2023-03-19 at 21:00:53: @protomneme @christineist i relate to difficulty being alone with self, and history of over-seeking connection with others. i’ve found the more i can keep my ego in check, the more enjoyable time by myself is

2023-03-19 at 20:58:52: @protomneme @br___ian and i were talkin about this a few months ago - realizing we can talk to ourselves and hear ourselves out

2023-03-19 at 20:41:42: savoring that warm blossom of well-being, safety, and contentment after eating a meal that satiates me

2023-03-19 at 18:50:52: @donmexlar jolly rancher of freedom! what a phrase!

2023-03-19 at 18:48:23: my legs feel so frickin good after getting a run in yesterday!

2023-03-19 at 17:53:48: this one goes so hard https://t.co/iVhZvxGmUm

2023-03-19 at 05:21:27: still waiting to hear back about rental application. i think i might say no even if it gets approved! :o

it’s been valuable to genuinely consider the prospect of moving &amp; improving my commute / daily life

2023-03-19 at 02:26:12: funny how loneliness can stem both from inadequate connection to others and inadequate connection to self

2023-03-18 at 05:35:12: @veggiebat_ v cute, i esp love the hoop earrings with the beads/stones situation goin on

2023-03-18 at 05:24:02: oh i think i’m experientially deepening my understanding of svādhyāya (self-study, chanting of sacred texts/japa) - that is a process that is unfolding for me now

2023-03-18 at 03:12:10: being with friends and feeling emotionally safe - all parts of me, including that mindful psychedelic / altered states of consciousness appreciator, and that soft hearted self who wants to be the best she can be for all those around her… i’m stoking that inner joy fire

2023-03-18 at 03:09:28: in our meeting today my advisor could tell i was in a low state after the past few weeks, especially this past one. he encouraged me to orient towards things that bring me joy, even if they aren’t the most practical. he said it’s valuable to learn how to recover from low periods

2023-03-18 at 03:07:37: first set of friends was home! i’ve taken so many notes already on plant biology and fun science and also psychological things

2023-03-18 at 01:34:20: i’ve set off on a long walk, perhaps i will keep walking and trying friend’s places until i find a friend who is home hehehe

2023-03-17 at 19:39:11: @veggiebat_ v good and hehe ofc 💕

2023-03-17 at 18:18:42: @veggiebat_ are u warm enough in your home?

2023-03-16 at 16:18:43: @responsiblparty i’m aware

2023-03-16 at 07:02:52: @veggiebat_ what mountain is that in the distance?

2023-03-16 at 07:02:33: @veggiebat_ ah wow so lovely 🤍

2023-03-16 at 05:53:45: @petrichor_lull hope u have a nice flight! :)

2023-03-16 at 05:51:55: @responsiblparty at that moment i was walking home from a friend's looking forward to my evening practice

2023-03-15 at 18:54:38: @donmexlar https://t.co/KrRODTDvaL

2023-03-15 at 07:08:46: @s0ulDirect0r ☺️🙏🏽☀️

2023-03-15 at 06:57:50: @_StevenFan what are the consequences of preventing dendritic pruning?

2023-03-15 at 05:18:54: can’t wait 2 hang out with god

2023-03-15 at 02:41:07: @yassoma i'm not worried, i trust that the powers that be know the true contents of one's heart

2023-03-15 at 01:59:50: working on a rental application! would appreciate any positive energy directed my way 💗

2023-03-14 at 02:29:46: fog rollin in, santa cruz https://t.co/yuPvvYwjKF

2023-03-14 at 02:22:10: she was a complete black box to me before. but now we’ve liked each others’ posts about our respective boyfriends (implicit approval); and she sent me a baby photo of me with my mom i’d never seen before :’)

2023-03-14 at 02:20:26: grateful for this window into her world - getting to know who she is as a person!

2023-03-14 at 02:19:56: ok so i only have 3 cousins on my dad’s side. i know very little about them, we haven’t had a way or reason to connect &amp; there’s been heavy family stuff ongoing. however! i recently found my one cousin on insta and she posts a ton and i feel like i’m finally getting 2 know her 😭

2023-03-14 at 02:11:57: i’m at lab retreat in a big house in santa cruz and i’m chillin in my room on phone with bf. i can hear my labmates hanging out and starting to cook dinner and it is very cozy. grateful for these experiences, opportunities to grow closer 💓

2023-03-12 at 07:42:24: @quotidiania @friedtrucknuts very cozy! i like the different patterns of sweater and pants, they complement each other. the pants are such a good statement piece!

2023-03-12 at 06:48:32: last time i drove my car was 8 days ago lol i really don’t drive that much right now. but it felt so good to be out and about! i felt tremendously agentic

2023-03-12 at 06:46:40: proud of myself for getting out and doing things today! drove into the city to check out a potential future home (🤞❤️‍🔥), stopped by work, had a call with mom about insurance stuff, drove back across bay bridge for dinner w friend

2023-03-12 at 06:45:01: driving home from dinner with a friend, first order of business when i get home is my evening sadhana

2023-03-11 at 22:11:51: undirected mind spinning with nowhere to go? play some bhajans and redirect ur mind to GOD 😤😌

2023-03-10 at 18:37:21: @TheGrandBlooms last summer when i discovered the power of routine https://t.co/pUntzVTrRZ

2023-03-10 at 07:50:51: good night twitter! may you get a good night of rest, and may you wake up with joy in your heart 🌙

2023-03-10 at 03:54:50: i foresee major quality of life improvements once i get my sewing machine and figure out how to take in the waist of all the pants i have that don’t fit!!! it seems like in many cases all u have to do is sew a dart. i can figure out how to do that!

2023-03-10 at 03:34:18: @tramazonflora oh wow so sick to see this info in this format! resonance w shadow aspects of tara, tripura sundari, tripura bhairavi, and chinnamasta… and what’s cool is the light flip side is exactly the value to refocus on 🤯🌸

2023-03-10 at 03:30:09: also lol workin on a new/slightly diff username so that it is more easily pronounce-able. would happily take any suggestions

2023-03-10 at 03:29:13: ahhhh what a relief to feel again that there is more to life, that there are vast terrains to explore and discover within myself. that my efforts could actually lead to fruition!

2023-03-10 at 03:15:33: RT @wholebodyprayer: alright overthinkers. Lets commit to more DANCE, SINGING, MASSAGE, COOKING WITHOUT RECIPES, ART WITHOUT OUTCOMES, PLAY…

2023-03-10 at 02:26:12: spent the day at home by myself feeling my feelings (scary, lots of them, lots i’ve been avoiding) but i have to say now a deep gratification has set in!

2023-03-10 at 01:58:39: @responsiblparty awh

2023-03-09 at 00:11:41: calling in a cozy 4-6 person home in the city, within comfortable commuting distance to work, with room for me, my cat, and in a few months my partner too

2023-03-08 at 16:54:20: @alexeyguzey so good! needed to know 42 five years ago but better late than never

2023-03-07 at 21:43:33: whole new frame! rings true https://t.co/GP4eLaskiS

2023-03-07 at 21:23:09: wanna skip to the part where i know how to sustain my energy ahaha https://t.co/nb9Ob4GR5U

2023-03-07 at 21:09:10: also this. big if true! feels like it could very well be true. i also associate jessica with “caring adult count”, which is another useful concept :) https://t.co/rVhJDmwrXa

2023-03-07 at 21:01:18: i want to lean into my science and let my love &amp; dedication consume me

2023-03-07 at 20:53:09: i think the artist i most viscerally love is daphni. put off listening to his stuff for a little bit, then heard a snippet several months ago and just knew i’d love anything of his

2023-03-07 at 20:43:54: do u guys oscillate between periods of high and low confidence too? does it get better as you get older?

2023-03-07 at 20:23:51: what if i turned towards those things i’m avoiding with full knowledge that they cannot hurt that which i truly am (brahman)

2023-03-07 at 20:20:35: it’s a big part of me and i been sleepin on it a bit as of late :) would love to talk to other people about this too if it’s of mutual interest :)

2023-03-07 at 20:19:04: i really gotta get back on my love of hinduism and joy of learning to exist as a woman within that framework

2023-03-07 at 19:39:40: “creating without fear” has stuck in my head ever since i first saw this tweet! i want to understand what that means for me https://t.co/LhMvNcpFSO

*how i want to be in the world, what my principles are, subconscious limiting beliefs

2023-03-04 at 00:59:46: @this_is_silvia lovely, thank you! 💕

2023-03-03 at 20:32:18: panic attack! at the gym

2023-03-03 at 17:14:15: @this_is_silvia congrats on surpassing ur goal for last year!

2023-03-02 at 06:49:59: love a good tipsy walk home

2023-03-02 at 01:08:21: and again! time to make myself a cuppa tea and read chapter for book club meeting this evening

2023-03-01 at 04:55:15: ok setting a timer to intentionally do something other than manically working on my creative project lolol

2023-02-26 at 00:37:36: @nickcammarata hehe ty i think so too :)

2023-02-25 at 23:23:08: @the_wilderless i been tryna activate that region when i strength train, squeezing rhomboid muscles in towards spine

2023-02-25 at 10:31:01: TIL that bay leaf gives dishes a slightly sweet, tea-like note

2023-02-25 at 10:14:03: aaa so excited to be diving into music making as a means of authentic self expression

2023-02-25 at 10:13:33: but i have a midi controller that’s compatible already so i can play with that for now!

2023-02-25 at 10:13:02: so i have to figure out what audio interface and cables to order so i can record my synth into ableton…

2023-02-25 at 07:50:01: friday nite samosa chaat has been assembled! https://t.co/2znoLcvJMQ

2023-02-25 at 02:58:37: dis me 😌 https://t.co/NVt9fkt5dm

2023-02-25 at 02:54:46: i expressed this sentiment out loud to two of my labmates and they said it was a silly and very characteristic of me thing to say

2023-02-25 at 01:50:33: @christineist pretty fuckin juicy

2023-02-24 at 22:00:44: i kinda like the stormy weather in the bay this past day and a bit. nice to have the opportunity to steady myself against an external challenge

2023-02-24 at 21:58:52: i kinda feel like the Trick is to find a way of accepting exactly where you’re at. and then things can flow as they need to, towards resolution on their own terms. you are but a vessel, my friend, and your task is to dissolve all barriers between yourself and Now

2023-02-24 at 21:13:00: like the duration of long distance is something at least ime you try *not* to think about, you just trust that at the end it will feel so worthwhile. then you can look back together and marvel

2023-02-24 at 21:11:03: literally unthinkable

2023-02-24 at 21:10:41: one of my mentors did long distance with his wife for SEVEN years

2023-02-24 at 21:06:39: no more ruminating even if it feels a lil pleasant, time to read about plant endomembranes

2023-02-24 at 02:38:38: - exercise (strength train either mid morning or mid-afternoon, run anytime mid-day onwards)
- eating enough and on time
- sleeping ideally 7.5-8h
- processing emotions via journaling and experiencing
- checking in &amp; staying connected w fam and long dist bf
- creativity! hobbies!

2023-02-24 at 02:30:25: i’ve got 2/4 members sorted :D earlier this week i had 0/4

2023-02-24 at 02:29:18: i am v happy to be making progress on assembling my qualifying exam committee!

2023-02-23 at 16:50:11: reflections as grad student w super flexible working hours: it is rarely ever about the time i get to work, what is more important to do the things to get my mind and body and spirit into good shape for solving problems

2023-02-23 at 04:27:39: funny to observe n bring greater awareness to how my anxious attachment patterns perpetuate beliefs n behaviors in close relationships

2023-02-23 at 03:24:23: @christineist i’ve been thinkin about how our relationships (at least close n healthy ones) help us distill each of our essences!

2023-02-23 at 00:14:25: ordering primers! https://t.co/hM2FbXW49r

2023-02-22 at 18:14:35: tryna be a never-ending well of positivity

2023-02-22 at 18:05:36: can there be separation between missing a person and missing what they bring out in you?

Deepen into direct experience

Notice that direct experience contains a LOT more than you tho…

2023-02-21 at 17:24:33: i get to welcome a friend to san francisco today! it’ll be her first time here. i’m excited to show her my home n see it through new eyes myself

2023-02-21 at 17:19:30: @ElodesNL @nosilverv super interesting and resonant!

2023-02-21 at 06:50:36: had a good leg day! ordered egg white protein powder!

2023-02-21 at 05:01:04: @danielbrottman thanks for your perspective daniel, no worries. i was soliciting hindu opinions because i feel i’ve seen plenty of discussion on this topic as it relates to buddhism, which is ofc broadly relevant but i’m a little tired of transposing what is said there to what makes sense for me

2023-02-20 at 22:04:36: it is empowering to elucidate your values and to life a life aligned with them

2023-02-20 at 21:36:49: i am never as Bad as i think i am. how can i so easily forget about my redeeming qualities!

2023-02-20 at 21:36:24: i am discovering yet again that even if i am consumed by thoughts of comparison or inferiority, i must find a way to love where i am at

2023-02-20 at 21:29:06: it seems like there are no hard and fast rules. i’m trying to understand what my adopted belief system (hinduism) has to say, so that i can sit with it as a value and use these values to guide my actions

2023-02-20 at 21:26:42: @AdamInProgress @bluechairgirly @kbala444

2023-02-20 at 21:25:12: curious if hindu homies have thoughts on yogic values &amp; substance use, especially but not necessarily cannabis

like afaik there’s no direct equivalent to buddhist precept to abstain from intoxication. the niyama of shaucha comes to mind, maybe - purity of mind, speech, body

2023-02-20 at 18:38:16: @adrusi big same this tweet re appeared in my mind this morning and i scrolled through my likes to find it

2023-02-19 at 09:07:28: i’ve been doing lots of emotional work i think i deserve a late night pop tart

2023-02-19 at 01:28:47: perhaps a nice next crochet project would be a couple trinkets for friends - coasters, lil wall hangings. i have some bigger clothing projects i’m envisioning / starting to work on, but they can be intimidating &amp; i just gotta keep the momentum going n the creative energy flowin’

2023-02-19 at 01:23:40: how do you return to or reconnect with your natural goodness?

2023-02-18 at 22:38:02: tryna cultivate my gentleness

2023-02-18 at 00:29:58: oh man it might be a frozen pizza kinda evening i am so here for it

2023-02-18 at 00:27:21: yay for getting home from work when the sun’s still up!

2023-02-18 at 00:14:46: i’m just so excited about the transition from long distance to living together. makes my heart feel buoyant. several more months yet, but the future draws closer with every passing day &lt;3

2023-02-18 at 00:12:16: oh here have some microscope pictures of cells https://t.co/dx3goQJ3up

2023-02-18 at 00:03:07: yesterday the french postdoc advised on how to fix my HEK cell culture techniques, including a step where before trypsin u rinse with PBS so all serum is removed from cells, cuz FBS quenches the trypsin &amp; makes it less effective. i noted this in obsidian &amp; dreamt about it ln

2023-02-17 at 23:59:55: bruh when i come back to work monday my HEKs better be nice n healthy and 90% confluent… and may my low population transduced neutrophil line recover so i can sort it &amp; use it for experiments!!

2023-02-17 at 17:46:23: @powerbottomdad1 this is great! really enjoyed reading it, appreciate ur perspective

2023-02-17 at 17:34:35: today we use the flow cytometer to sort my cells &amp; see if the transfection n transduction were successful!

2023-02-17 at 17:31:52: it’s ok tho it should get me the calories i need, and i’d say it’s a decent lunch for the last work day of the week!

2023-02-17 at 17:28:51: two minimalist ham n cheese sandwiches and a clif bar lunch today kinda day

2023-02-17 at 07:15:57: @marshmarigold :( 🌿 have u tried l-theanine with or without weed?

2023-02-17 at 06:41:25: ok my goal is to wake at 730am tomo!

2023-02-16 at 19:42:16: journaled and realized i was hating on a tendency of mine - a part if you will - that only means well!

2023-02-16 at 18:00:20: being a grad student in ur element is wonderful bc you get to be highly agentic and active

2023-02-16 at 05:52:56: @christineist have u always been able to harness this energy? if not was there a transition point?

2023-02-14 at 05:23:11: wow it’s so nice to text back n forth with friends when u see their typing bubbles and know they’re waiting for urs

2023-02-13 at 23:59:54: @AnneSelke @profeshkitten me 2!

2023-02-13 at 19:34:08: better to embrace it than to deny it

2023-02-13 at 19:33:25: i guess now we hunker down in this body and be with the internal storm and battering hail, that crackling anxiety in my chest and arms

2023-02-13 at 19:31:40: nervous system alarm bell keeps ringing! even though i did my morning routine and prayers and ate breakfast and commuted (commuting) to work. i even made a call to sort out a medication thing that was stressing me &amp; it got sorted way easier than expected

2023-02-13 at 16:39:16: @hamzaiandafirst my spiritual text asserts that voluntary action is very much real so i will continue to believe that

2023-02-13 at 02:28:15: @tasshinfogleman east of eden!!!

2023-02-13 at 02:27:28: @hamzaiandafirst 💯 tho it’s an interesting interplay between god’s plan/supremacy and the human capacity for voluntary action (as opposed to instinctual action)

2023-02-13 at 01:57:17: but i am reading a spiritual text now and things are clicking or at least soothing my spirit. i will continue to turn towards my faith 🤎

2023-02-13 at 01:56:18: for the last few weeks i have had moments where i feel hopeless when i think about the future. i think about my own bad traits and how life sometimes feels out of control, and i wonder, how can i trust that this will get better? what will convince me?

2023-02-12 at 00:44:17: @altashtree 💖☀️💕

2023-02-12 at 00:44:06: @altashtree it is beautiful out! we went on a hike closer to coast earlier, was windier there, calmer here!

2023-02-11 at 16:51:46: strength trained 3x this week and i am obsessed with how lovely it feels to be occupying this body… that sweet sweet delayed onset muscle soreness

2023-02-11 at 06:33:47: @christineist @simiiform yayyy!!! the pt worked!

2023-02-11 at 04:24:26: want to snuggle w bf but he is 400 miles away!

2023-02-11 at 01:58:13: so when u deadlift do you keep ur core braced the whole set or do you brace and re-brace at some point during the movement?

2023-02-10 at 05:05:13: currently makin potato leek lentil soup n banana bread

2023-02-09 at 20:30:42: guess who’s a lil depressy and negative cuz she had a drink last night

2023-02-09 at 20:23:12: tracing narratives in my head and dissolving them once i find they’re based on a panicked thought, not ground reality

2023-02-09 at 20:21:51: oh the power of, “if this is really a problem, it will still exist when i’m in a better headspace”

2023-02-09 at 01:51:39: i know im gonna have massive fomo but i might have to make the “not going to vibecamp” call. significant phd milestone will likely be happening mid-june, and moving house around that time too!

2023-02-08 at 02:14:42: i worked out and had a Good work day today and now on my commute i have blessedly fewer thoughts than usual. feels like each thought can rise up and be considered then dissolve

2023-02-08 at 02:10:20: rational mind wants to figure everything out before taking a step forward, thinking 1) it can predict the future, 2) it is in control of the future. no, sweet mind. the future is beyond the scope of our comprehension &amp; god/karma is the orchestrator

2023-02-08 at 02:05:46: i was just gonna keep thinkin when i was in fact ready to start acting!

2023-02-08 at 02:04:44: in the last hour of the workday my lab mate saved me from my overthinking. she helped me *just get started* on a multi-day procedure - when previously i was gonna keep marinating on it til thursday or later. i feel great :D

2023-02-07 at 05:53:59: rice n beans and buttered spinach for dinner! first time cooking a full meal in several weeks and wow i love to cook https://t.co/ZJRGgPTPLR

2023-02-07 at 05:52:49: i’m getting back into cooking! this is a thread to document food i make 😌🥘 &amp; happy kitchen moments

2023-02-06 at 23:11:24: @zencephalon inspirational 💓 u have any advice for getting started cultivating positive emotion w metta?

2023-02-06 at 23:09:23: i be living. the days be passin

2023-02-06 at 23:09:00: it would probably heal some part of me if i brushed up on my coding… would make me feel more competent. i was recently advised to learn about data frames / relational data structures for analyzing lots of variables that could be correlated

2023-02-06 at 23:04:02: oh hehe my gpa was 3.78 or close to it. freshman fall i got a 3.55 gpa and my dad was disappointed and that hurt!!! but sophomore year i came back and got straight A’s in the spring semester. got my one and only A+ junior fall! i’ll tell u what class it was in if anyone asks

2023-02-06 at 23:01:13: i’m curious if anybody else had painful undergrads that left an imprint on them… and how’d ya recover? cuz that’s what i’m trying to do now

2023-02-06 at 23:00:39: i think for me, the emotional pain of undergrad has created some bad work habits that persist even tho i’m in a phd program now &amp; am doing work that feels more aligned w my strengths (less engineering, more science; less math, more biology, more talking to ppl)

2023-02-06 at 22:59:10: college was so much harder than high school for me. i was also in the engineering school, but never mastered math, so i always felt like i was flailing aside from a few high points. i procrastinated a ton bc the work was overwhelming &amp; didn’t feel aligned w my strengths

2023-02-06 at 22:57:08: what was your emotional experience of undergrad like? // what was your gpa?

2023-02-06 at 21:34:26: something i believe abt the psyche: excess energy without application creates anxiety!

2023-02-06 at 19:38:02: i’ve been rediscovering self-expression thru the way i dress &amp; accessorize myself! it is great fun! i’m wearing a real power fit today

2023-02-06 at 19:33:40: hoping to get my commute &amp; cooking under control in the next week or two :) one day at a time

2023-02-06 at 19:23:52: and what of that yearning to be pure? which burns fiercer each time we unearth new darkness within? how long til we find that the pureness we seek is within and ever-present?

2023-02-06 at 19:18:36: related, sigh https://t.co/4lJdtEnaaP

2023-02-06 at 19:15:44: lol i am on my commute to work can u believe i’m about to be at work lol. it’ll be nice tho i like my coworkers a lot

2023-02-06 at 19:13:43: like, it’s cool that i enjoy psytrance, less cool that it took mdma in the forest to rewire my brain into enjoying it… makes me feel a bit corrupted

2023-02-06 at 19:11:45: i feel like i need to re-experience the power of dance music in a non bay area setting

2023-02-06 at 18:44:11: although having met my partner early on is a tremendous gift, one thing we’ve realized is: i have to put more effort into developing myself as an individual, ensuring i have an identity beyond our shared identity. which benefits everyone!

2023-02-06 at 18:41:15: i initially was like :o in response to friend. i asked her, what do you think of the prediction? i would be pretty down if i got that prediction. she said it didn’t make her sad at all - she said it gave her peace, it made sense.

2023-02-06 at 18:39:17: mom got an astrology reading done for me around age ~18-19 and it said i’d meet my life partner between ages 19-21. which happened!

my friend got her romantic fortune told by a psychic: “two serious relationships &amp; a child from latter, then meet your life partner late thirties”

2023-02-06 at 18:31:55: maybe it’s my masculine side feeling super tortured w/o good relationship to work. ayurvedic practitioner felt my pulse and was surprised by pitta strength in addition to vata. he also said my masculine energy was strong but i tend to try and hide it 👀 i was like :o tru

2023-02-06 at 18:30:09: i just have 2 push through and make the slightest bit of real progress at work and i know i am going to feel So much better about life 😭😭😭

2023-02-06 at 18:23:14: i’ve just been wearing baseball caps or sun hats … normal sunglasses over my glasses when i drive &amp; sun’s in my eyes. my poor eyes deserve better than this

2023-02-06 at 18:22:04: ok it’s happening this week. after months of putting it off, i will b ordering a pair of prescription sunglasses

2023-02-06 at 18:21:14: whereas my constricted nervous system state thinks i must ride out negative feelings, do more, then feel good

2023-02-06 at 18:19:03: i know as i start leaning into positive feelings towards/within myself, i’ll naturally become more capable of doing more things

2023-02-06 at 17:56:53: feelin the desire to become more motivated &amp; happy for the benefit of those close to me

2023-02-03 at 22:36:06: where was ur first date with your partner? 🫶🏽

2023-02-03 at 22:34:09: @chaichitta hmmmm i’ve heard soaking beans before hand / cooking in hot water then discarding that water before further use… idk exactly what, but basically there might be ways to change legume prep to make ‘em more digestible &amp; less gas producing

2023-02-03 at 19:48:25: last night when stoned i came upon a memory scene i hadn’t been to in a long time. a garden, that of my dad’s colleague J and his wife C, who were like grandparents to me. their backyard was a mystical place - an arbor of flowers, stone benches and figures 🪴

2023-02-03 at 06:05:21: served mango juice to friends n they informed me it amplifies a thc high! new info to me… can def feel it

2023-02-03 at 00:42:24: yay 4 showing up. i know my body’s gonna feel so good

2023-02-03 at 00:41:55: finally attending a yoga class this evening which i missed last week (had a cold) and the week prior (stuck at work a lil too late, generally felt like life was spiraling out of control)

2023-02-02 at 18:59:55: hit rock bottom now i get to reconstruct my routine and life from the ground up :)

2023-02-02 at 18:56:57: @chercher_ai in our lab meetings if somebody prefaces their presentation with “this won’t be long” it’s treated as the gauntlet being thrown down. get ready to be asked all the possible questions ahaha

2023-02-02 at 16:13:14: yesterday evening i listened to darude sandstorm in the MRI and it was pretty great

2023-02-02 at 16:11:45: @TylerAlterman good instinct to be cautious of favoring frameworks over direct experience early on!

2023-01-28 at 23:18:07: i think this is what it means to walk with spirit

2023-01-28 at 23:12:59: recent experiences be dialing way up my openness to new experience / willingness to relinquish my vision of what’s to come, and surrender to the play and divine unfolding

2023-01-28 at 23:11:43: really fun to play around with changing my appearance / self-expression at a heavy/formative moment of life

had a ball thrifting yesterday and building an entirely new fit w versatile pieces … and now to see if some haircut magic can be worked!

2023-01-28 at 23:02:16: like the energy literally moving, pulsing in on place then another, in my heart space

i’m looking for low maintenance but chic. don’t want a haircut that involves straightening/styling (like a forehead fringe or curtain bangs in my hair)

2023-01-28 at 02:54:06: time to self-regulate by drinking some soup and then meditating

2023-01-27 at 18:57:44: life pulls you into its deep currents whenever it so pleases

2023-01-27 at 17:09:13: feeling more and more that i really am just acting out my karma in each passing moment. control is an illusion. ego-i thinks it knows what’s going on but there is so much at work beyond the perception of ego

2023-01-22 at 23:08:11: having a wonderful weekend in person with my person :) ☀️

2023-01-21 at 02:34:09: that is, if he makes his flight 😅😅😅

2023-01-21 at 02:28:24: made it through the work day (made progress on things! kept the rock moving!) and now all that’s left to do is to shower n get dolled up n pick up bf from the airport!!! 💖

2023-01-21 at 02:24:37: @cursedmargarita hell ya. cozy

2023-01-21 at 02:15:48: the other reassuring thing is that i didn’t take my supplements for like a week, week and half during a low period, and my levels are still good :D

2023-01-21 at 02:15:01: got some blood work back and for the first time maybe ever i’m not vitamin d deficient! yay for the power of consistent supplementing ☀️☀️☀️

2023-01-21 at 01:22:03: february is shaping up to be a wonderful month of seeing/hosting friends visiting from far away! “come to me” era indeed 💕 https://t.co/PbRK6r6h8h

2023-01-20 at 01:06:54: @cursedmargarita what led u to stop smoking?

2023-01-20 at 01:05:00: feelin like i should get a pair of compensatory shoes. comfy platforms that allow me to be 5’4” or even - dare to dream - 5’5”

2023-01-20 at 00:32:45: train commute home, then yoga, then i will drink warm chicken bone broth at home!

2023-01-19 at 19:59:59: evidently my subconscious doesn’t accept that i am “working” unless i’m experiencing internal tension. i couldn’t possibly be working if it feels easy!

2023-01-19 at 00:53:35: @poIypore 💕☺️ yes! and this reminds me to get you a kitchari recipe. do you have an instant pot or the like?

2023-01-18 at 22:55:13: @yokaihainen saw fennesz live several months ago in LA!

2023-01-18 at 22:43:28: @isosteph made me laugh out loud

2023-01-18 at 22:42:51: seeking recommendations for a lil lamp (probably sub $40) that provides warm light. already have a himalayan salt lamp

2023-01-18 at 22:40:51: my working theory is that experiencing chronic illness / childhood illness predisposes one to seek more physical touch reassurance &amp; regulation (more likely to have physical touch as a highly ranked love language)

2023-01-18 at 22:37:37: @eIfcup @cIass_man hi guys nice to see u on the TL i think nostalgically of coming across both of u 2+ years ago!!!

2023-01-18 at 22:27:14: i am so blessed by abundant friendship in my present life!

2023-01-18 at 22:24:57: she is the best kind of person and boy am i grateful our paths intersected

2023-01-18 at 22:19:59: love my roommate. we just (as of 1/15) hit one year of living together! she’s at work today and i just finished cleaning the kitchen and i knooow she’s gonna be so happy to come home to a tidy, nice-smelling kitchen

2023-01-18 at 21:50:57: gonna have dinner with my friend who’s super into foraging ☺️ she and a friend are going mushroom hunting in a bit and then we’ll have dinner together made with whatever they find!

2023-01-18 at 20:41:56: for real tho. i’ve lost 15+ pounds since august ‘21 due to a recurring health issue. that’s a lot to lose from my frame and i haven’t been able to gain any of it back yet

hence, bulking! 

copious butter. big portion sizes. building my sturdiness from da ground up

2023-01-18 at 20:36:07: it’s bulking szn

2023-01-18 at 18:16:14: @veggiebat_ 👀 u get me

2023-01-18 at 04:15:21: @cIass_man omg didn’t notice til now ur over 3k!

2023-01-16 at 18:57:57: @hormeze https://t.co/CCauREdqF8

2023-01-16 at 07:56:18: @christineist so how can we indirectly aim for such values?

2023-01-16 at 07:55:31: @christineist +1 i find watching youtube videos far more effective for learning recipes than reading written instructions

2023-01-16 at 03:51:46: @sokindling when i read norwegian wood, something that stuck with me &amp; provided inspiration was protagonist’s regular letter-writing habit. no need to read if not compelling - just a potential source of inspiration!

2023-01-16 at 03:09:52: gotta get back on my morning routine shit

2023-01-16 at 03:08:05: @donmexlar you are allowed to run nice n slow

2023-01-16 at 03:07:38: from a vid i watched earlier today: your job is not to know exactly how things will play out - your job is to keep showing up

2023-01-16 at 03:02:42: also entering my very literal bedroom dj era

2023-01-16 at 02:59:01: well would you look at that my problems have not in fact magically resolved themselves… looks like i have to turn towards them

2023-01-16 at 02:58:13: @donmexlar when i’m in good shape i have to run 3 miles or more at once to feel that i’ve expended enough energy!

2023-01-16 at 02:48:09: @veggiebat_ ahaha to the jugular i needed this

2023-01-16 at 02:43:04: @donmexlar one of my fav books!!! read over christmas 2021, finished on flight headed home either from or to vegas. was quiet for some moments and laid down on the empty seats beside me, and before long my whole body began to shake with sobs

2023-01-15 at 19:53:27: entering my staying at home n crafting era... my "come to me" era. have to go easy on my body while i'm trying to heal from acute health challenges

2023-01-15 at 19:49:47: @donmexlar subbed :)

2023-01-14 at 01:34:28: @embryosophy oh this is similar to a vision sri ramakrishna / vivekananda would have :o

2023-01-13 at 02:32:17: @hormeze i wouldn’t say i’m an expert but i have a shared interest

2023-01-12 at 16:52:15: @goblinodds i was in adolescence but not at all now!

2023-01-12 at 09:00:44: @zestular getting a little dissociated makes you appreciate your body more &amp; become more aware when you come back to it

2023-01-12 at 07:54:33: @margaritamaxxed i had a moment i think yesterday where i felt exactly this and considered tweeting it

2023-01-12 at 00:29:41: she tweeted whilst scribbling down notes after an exciting conversation with a potential collaborator &amp; author of a paper she’s been obsessed with… :D i &lt;3 being a scientist

2023-01-12 at 00:28:17: wow i fuckin love my life

2023-01-12 at 00:11:38: i found him and have learned a few things but he keeps ignoring me or talking over me :(

2023-01-11 at 23:18:38: i know that one way towards feeling better is countering that negative internal feeling/narrative by doing even a small thing to take care of myself/my affairs

2023-01-11 at 23:15:04: it’s not like everything has been going downhill / stagnating. in fact, recently a thing that’s looong triggered me became like, way less triggering, basically not triggering at all. something clicked into place within. fascinating to observe. i do want to be happy/optimistic tho

2023-01-11 at 23:13:38: idk why ego n subconscious have been creating a persistent negative internal feeling, sense of “doom” / cynicism about self

2023-01-11 at 23:11:03: @_ArnaudS_ would love to join if i feel up to it, getting back from weeklong conf friday

2023-01-11 at 23:08:27: gently dismantling that internal story that my life is going downhill, that i am not using my time right, that every day will continue to feel separate from the last &amp; will never add up to anything

2023-01-11 at 06:49:15: “u get loopy when u do drugs i get loopy when i ride trains”

2023-01-11 at 05:50:25: @embryosophy plans are materializing for me to experience a first cigar tomorrow 🙈

2023-01-10 at 23:16:18: lil dance and singing break in my room before going back to conference session

2023-01-10 at 23:14:56: one astrologer looked at my chart a few years ago &amp; his very first piece of advice was “speak only when absolutely necessary”. at first i was a bit miffed but i kinda get it now

2023-01-10 at 22:10:58: @petrichor_lull @ashton_mae1 mint tea good for digestion so perhaps in a roundabout way soothing for the mind

2023-01-10 at 22:07:43: @eurydicelives @hormeze vibes

2023-01-10 at 22:06:40: @eurydicelives i’m getting @donmexlar

2023-01-07 at 14:17:20: entering my cool tones era

2023-01-06 at 22:49:46: guess i’ll just have to track him/her down 😁

2023-01-06 at 22:47:08: heading to week long science conference tomorrow! the mystery &amp; fun begins - was browsing a list of posters &amp; found one directly relevant to my research interests but cannot find ANY info on the presenter!

2023-01-06 at 20:16:43: oho can’t forget about starting full moon practices. i’ve long had the desire to attune to the moon’s cycles, and now i have more information &amp; the impetus to invest energy into this (emotional pain of health flare-up). let’s turn this pain into something beautiful 💪🏽

2023-01-06 at 19:30:35: the book that’s captured my heart at present is “a tale for the time being” by ruth ozeki. it’s so good. so many vivid images and deep moments; magical realism interwoven with zen themes

2023-01-06 at 19:04:50: today:
• commute to lab
• meet with new student
• meet with advisor
• commute home
• pick up more cat food
• pick up prescription from cvs
• pack
• clean
• early bed time

2023-01-06 at 17:11:53: today’s feeling like a barely getting myself out the door kinda day

2023-01-06 at 16:19:55: @chaichitta i miss kalika…. feel like she’s been gone for 1 month+

2023-01-05 at 19:18:32: post-shower:
• moisturizing and getting dressed and makin my hair cute
• 25 min timer for fiction writing
• lunch
• unpacking &amp; cleaning
• looking at conference programme for this wknd and taking notes on titles/speakers that interest me :)
• calling home

2023-01-05 at 19:08:40: i know this isn’t ✧reality✧

the “memory spoiled” / universe’s reprimand are stories i’m attaching the events that occurred

there’s some sense i have that i deserve this health flare up

which until recently stopped me from being able to feel sympathy for myself

2023-01-05 at 19:04:51: i’m mildly pissed that my health issue had to flare up during an otherwise amazing trip with boyfriend. feels like it spoiled the memory / is the universe telling me i can’t have fun or be adventurous

2023-01-05 at 18:59:55: bruh this shower is about to be so good for my subconscious sense of freshness/cleanliness, which feeds into my overall sense of well-being

2023-01-05 at 18:35:11: we pursue self-destructive behaviors because we want to be broken open

2023-01-05 at 18:31:38: self-compassion has entered the chat

2023-01-05 at 17:31:56: @horsesxinfinite abstract answer: the more i learn about biology and the human body/human health, the more i'm struck by a sense of fractal complexity. in the face of this complexity, talking to others about experiences &amp; tidbits of knowledge often illuminates parts of the map i hadn't considered

2023-01-05 at 17:20:04: @horsesxinfinite ty &lt;3

2023-01-05 at 17:12:15: not sure why i dwell in this low vibrational state, stagnant and disconnected from god &amp; the things i enjoy

2023-01-05 at 00:18:30: i feel like my uterus is an unstable system - ready to be perturbed and sent into a chaotic state. i would like it to not feel like that 😭 https://t.co/HlOKYceKe4

2023-01-05 at 00:18:30: not to mention august and october 2021, where twice i bled super super heavily for 10 days &amp; ended up anemic 2x. all this is suspected to relate to a polyp, but who knows. there's also the matter of the hormone meds i take &amp; how they all play into this

2023-01-04 at 23:55:58: one month+ i've been chilling, no bleeding, thinking maybe this is finally over... and then on trip to death valley last weekend, on the way to badwater, i feel a sharp pain and know i've started bleeding again

2023-01-04 at 23:54:20: in late october i messed up the dosage of one of my hormone meds once and spent the first 2.5 weeks of november bleeding. then bleeding stops. and is triggered again after a camping trip where it got particularly cold. i bleed for 6 days and then it stops

2023-01-04 at 23:52:13: i've been having these abnormal menstrual bleeding episodes since 2021 (really, since 2017) and i'm wondering if i can crowdsource wisdom on how to deal

2023-01-04 at 23:50:20: i think it should be fine but i'm hoping power doesn't go out with the storm bc i need this heating pad against my lower abdomen at all times

2023-01-04 at 22:04:31: @moonboi_ dropped acid after i missed my first train on my 10 hour train-bus route from emeryville to la. got on the next train 2h later. trippin by myself in an enclosed box on wheels was not the move

2023-01-04 at 19:09:48: @nat_sharpe_ not sure how mine will translate to art but i am curious! 🤞

2023-01-04 at 06:38:46: @veggiebat_ :) https://t.co/KQKLjiife4

2023-01-04 at 06:38:14: @grantbels yes!

2023-01-04 at 04:45:49: part of my plan for a rainy day tomorrow: going through my closet &amp; assembling &amp; taking pics of 5-10 outfits i feel good in!

2023-01-04 at 01:40:39: @ulkar_aghayeva hesse’s narcissus and goldmund

2023-01-03 at 22:36:42: it’s time for lab meeting yay for lab meeting

2023-01-03 at 21:37:07: i’m feeling empowered to do this with the energy of the new year. but i don’t know exactly how to go about it. i will trust my heart to guide me &amp; i will take advice

2023-01-03 at 21:36:13: my creative instinct at present is to burrow inward towards the visions i want to create in the world. i feel inundated with others’ work (mainly crochet &amp; writing) https://t.co/00v1lyIpQy

2023-01-02 at 19:03:14: @yokaihainen u know hark the advice u gave me in mid december really helped me take action &amp; feel better about work &amp; life overall. i’m feeling optimistic about 2023! 🙏🏽 you got this 💪🏽

2023-01-02 at 19:01:33: boyf and i are being mad soothed by the vastness of these landscapes

2023-01-02 at 18:58:28: gm ☀️ https://t.co/GAEkQIMPYC

2023-01-02 at 03:25:26: @eIfcup i address formally only as much as is needed to direct / focus my mind towards communication with god

2023-01-02 at 03:02:30: of course there’s a twinge of discomfort when you fail to listen to yourself &amp; honor your desires

2023-01-02 at 01:35:57: seems high? but i could believe the majority of people are lactose intolerant

2023-01-02 at 01:34:32: someone told me recently that 80% of people are/become lactose intolerant? big if true :o

2023-01-01 at 19:45:37: @danielthedaring @inaturalist 👑🌿

2023-01-01 at 06:26:52: cracked open the peach moscato n we got daphni playing in the background of a candlelit shower

2023-01-01 at 06:20:54: having a wonderful nye evening in with bf as the storm rages outside!

2023-01-01 at 01:15:16: reunited with my love all is well

2022-12-31 at 23:07:55: @BLUNDERBUSSTED 9 hours to go over in my slice of this earth!

2022-12-31 at 14:50:37: @joshuayn514 @donmexlar i think this is intentional

2022-12-31 at 13:36:04: @captain_mrs beautiful!

2022-12-31 at 03:28:53: @chercher_ai some periods daily transitioning to once weekly

2022-12-30 at 17:17:59: first sewing project in progress. i luv learning crafts from mom

2022-12-30 at 05:52:38: entering my pinterest manifestation era

2022-12-28 at 05:27:13: @valor_zhang i’d like one if you get to it 🙏🏽

2022-12-28 at 01:32:54: crochet update: i've been obsessed with making sweaters &amp; recently finished my first one. the universe just placed 2 beautiful sweaters into my hands &amp; i'm taking this as a sign to chill out on making sweaters, and instead make smaller projects &amp; gain skills &amp; learn new stitches

2022-12-27 at 01:15:58: i sat between my parents in the prayer hall and we meditated together. it felt special. i was aware that i will not always have them with me on this plane. it made the moment more precious, and i committed it to my storehouse of memory

2022-12-27 at 01:07:47: i also asked the monk for a reading recommendation on the nature of the mind and he walked straight across the room and plucked a volume from a top shelf. start here, he said, there are smaller books i can give you in the future

2022-12-27 at 01:06:05: momma got me a rudraksha mala and asked for a monk to bless it by thakur’s feet ☺️📿

2022-12-26 at 21:20:52: i also feel increasingly cute and hawt

2022-12-26 at 21:20:11: i’m guessing 1 yr to waist length hair and i feel more powerful &amp; more connected to tradition with every inch

2022-12-26 at 16:15:51: @quistydotquist a sense of continuity is something that ebbs and flows for me, and requires some active effort to promote

2022-12-26 at 03:47:21: @veggiebat_ hehe aw. what do you usually wear in your nose piercing? studs? a lil hoop?

2022-12-26 at 03:46:49: @veggiebat_ ohhh no the eyebrow i have individual control over is my right one, so it follows left side for the piercing. but i already have 2 ear cartilage piercings only on the left ear, and god forbid i become more asymmetrical!

2022-12-26 at 03:42:34: grateful for quality time with family. words cannot express how much i love these three humans &lt;3

2022-12-26 at 03:14:41: RT @tasshinfogleman: tits or ass? bro her ability to precisely describe her inner experience

2022-12-25 at 23:22:33: @minhwrites :) favorite dishes you’ve made? anything nostalgic?

2022-12-25 at 15:54:46: if u have a side-of-nose piercing, how did you decide which side to get it on?

2022-12-25 at 11:46:59: mere minutes until i am reunited with family! 🥰

2022-12-25 at 05:17:45: @moonboi_ wow this is so orderly. so peaceful

2022-12-25 at 04:41:37: bought a perfect sweater, a lovely lil ring for roommate, and a christmas trinket for bf :) then went to a bar &amp; read &amp; crocheted &amp; socialized and now tipsy offa 2.5 beers

2022-12-24 at 23:30:24: first time in an antique mall and this is soooo fun especially now during holiday time. the friendly older bearded man who welcomed me in said there are 50 diff vendors and the best way to experience the place is to “meander” !!!

2022-12-24 at 22:41:46: i’m not *bad* for seeking novelty or pleasure

2022-12-24 at 22:41:25: the idea that we as humans have a *need* for novelty and pleasure is one that is new to me &amp; i find it empowering

2022-12-24 at 22:14:30: wow i am having the best time. i love how nothing in the arts district is taller than 1 story https://t.co/QXtf4I1MGy

2022-12-24 at 22:13:59: the abundant antique malls call too 😭

2022-12-24 at 22:12:22: and later on i think i’ll give nevada tap room a try, i heard it being recommended in the crystal shop

2022-12-24 at 22:10:54: i’m gonna try n find a nice coffee shop to plop down in for a bit and start reading the ruth ozeki book my friend recommended. so curious if it will resonate with me or grip me!

2022-12-24 at 22:03:56: i’m at the sickest crystal shop! https://t.co/PDrvHw1SCp

2022-12-24 at 21:40:58: if views stays around i’m hoping to integrate it into a feeling of awareness &amp; appreciation of the hivemind

2022-12-24 at 21:39:16: @PrinceVogel do you think more clearly in cloudy weather or sunny weather?

2022-12-24 at 21:37:44: i was planning to walk from the airport to wherever i could walk to sightsee or get some peace and quiet. but i could not escape the airport on foot haha. i came upon the tiny ground floor public transit station &amp; boarded the 108 bus not knowing exactly where it went

2022-12-24 at 21:34:30: wow i love the bus i love public transit it’s a dream for an overly frugal grad student who gets stressed when she drives

2022-12-24 at 21:31:19: manifesting a thrift shop where i can get a cheap baseball cap or pair of sunglasses to protect my eyes from the bright sunlight

2022-12-24 at 21:30:21: i have boarded a bus to the arts district!

2022-12-24 at 17:27:39: pls reply below or dm if u would be down for a call sometime today! long layover, 12.5h to go

2022-12-24 at 16:41:18: @Maria_Pea_20 oh so cute! i didn’t realize one could knit little creatures too, i thought that was a crochet thing!

2022-12-24 at 16:40:04: @valor_zhang today i will occupy myself until my 10pm flight inside and in the vicinity of the vegas airport. started a crochet project. will nap at some point. will go for a walk to UNLV

2022-12-24 at 00:35:38: i am redeemable, i am not a failure, i am fine just as i am. i take selfless action and support my well-being &amp; that of those around me :)

2022-12-24 at 00:33:00: i was feeling quite irritable and down earlier today, but now my heart is a happy little puddle &amp; i feel optimistic about my travels tomorrow &amp; my work come january! grateful for the transience of emotions :)

2022-12-23 at 23:25:20: @br___ian oh one interesting thing. my mental model of dopamine is v simple: “yes dopamine i want it all the time”, “more dopamine good”

interestingly he says the creative process has two components - divergent and convergent thinking. former happens w high dop, latter w low dop

2022-12-23 at 22:53:53: in my limited experience with circling one idea i really like &amp; think about often is that of “staying in connection” with whoever i am interacting with

2022-12-23 at 22:51:35: @hormeze gunna pick some l-theanine up today

2022-12-23 at 16:56:48: @br___ian learned a lot of facts, not a lot of fun ones 😅

2022-12-23 at 04:19:42: @MCMCD_ looks so good!

2022-12-23 at 04:16:21: @isosteph i keep getting a comcast ad whenever i’ve opened the app today aha

2022-12-23 at 03:39:14: @_StevenFan 😭😭😭 are you sure you want it

2022-12-23 at 00:09:53: finally in the right headspace to give this a listen https://t.co/DnQx3O8fki

2022-12-22 at 20:18:44: @Prigoose a noble aspiration

2022-12-22 at 20:17:48: @202accepted is vegas known for its buffets?!

2022-12-22 at 20:01:21: so uhh. what to do with a day long (~7am-9pm) layover in vegas saturday

2022-12-22 at 19:57:42: @hormeze i like it, i love a good reframe. i don’t think my comedowns are generally from dissociated states tho so i am trying to see if the reframe generalizes

2022-12-22 at 18:57:23: i long for the day when i have more deeply internalized that there is a force larger than i am

2022-12-22 at 18:53:03: i find comedowns of all sorts so hard!

2022-12-22 at 18:15:12: i got radiation therapy as a child and i believe it made my torso a lil shorter than nature’s bioelectric blueprint intended it to be

2022-12-22 at 18:14:43: sometimes i think about how my body was meant to be a little taller

2022-12-22 at 17:02:40: after i get through the day, i get to spend the evening home alone with the cats with low lighting and maybe oiling my hair

2022-12-22 at 16:41:07: @mechanical_monk @DlABLESS supports immune system too!

2022-12-22 at 05:52:55: taking an epsom salt bath to ease sore muscles and promote a sense of  bodily well-being :)

2022-12-21 at 21:44:44: passed :)

2022-12-21 at 05:33:55: getting those sweet sweet freeway miles

2022-12-21 at 04:22:30: going on a drive to get my prius thru a drive cycle so that i can pass smog check tomo

2022-12-20 at 20:01:51: nervous system, disarmed. helpful to notice that my fearful/escalatory responses to challenges stem from a state of general nervous system overactivation. i don’t need to “fix my attitude”, i need to be gentle to myself &amp; actively self-regulate

2022-12-20 at 19:12:31: is this a Dark Night of the Soul? 🦋

2022-12-20 at 18:59:59: attachment/detachment to thought is a difficult concept to understand with one’s rational mind huh

2022-12-20 at 18:56:53: all this to say i’m relieved i realized this wasn’t a big deal and that everything will be okay and that i am capable of dealing with this

2022-12-20 at 18:56:18: having problems to solve allows you to be more engaged in action, and action - “working incessantly”, in swami vivekananda’s words - is purifying, grounding if done without attachment

2022-12-20 at 18:55:06: car failed smog check, technician explained what to do and i was in a daze. inner child started to get worried. big unsolvable problem, can’t be happy until this is fixed

on drive back calming voice arose in head: it’s okay, this is a solvable problem…

2022-12-20 at 03:28:13: @AskYatharth i have heard this!

2022-12-20 at 01:57:22: @er1enney0ung you too sweet éri!

2022-12-20 at 01:50:56: @er1enney0ung strength gratitude breakthrough creation 🙏🏽✨

2022-12-20 at 01:17:19: looking to 2023, i want to feel happy and whole and gainfully engaged in my pursuits. long distance continues to weigh on my heart and subconscious, but i must do all i can to love my life as it is

2022-12-20 at 01:15:35: you know, i’m starting to feel optimistic about life after the new year. i’ve set a few things in motion now and i know where to concentrate  much of my work energy and spiritual energy

2022-12-20 at 00:31:30: no trial is wasted!

2022-12-19 at 19:33:51: @flimsyfloppus @br___ian @christineist early mid jan! don’t want to give exact dates on tl

2022-12-19 at 17:39:58: there’s one yama or niyama that’s like, “the mind has bad taste in sense pleasures. over time through the practice of this virtue or guideline, you re-train your mind to instead seek spiritual joy/bliss/identification with the infinite”

i find this reassuring &amp; inspirational

2022-12-19 at 17:16:56: ego is like “if i give in at this stage of the argument, i feel like a doormat, i feel incapable of articulating things that affect me negatively &amp; thus i must just bear these negative things”

there’s a defeatedness for sure
but this too is transient

2022-12-18 at 21:23:44: lord help me learn how to hold in my heart and mind spiritual ideals without being tortured by the angst of not being there yet

2022-12-18 at 21:12:33: i want to be a woman worthy of your love

2022-12-18 at 03:28:01: @flimsyfloppus @br___ian @christineist update for u all: galveston is happening 🙈😭🎉

2022-12-18 at 02:57:52: love people not because they please you but rather for how true they are when they interact with you

2022-12-18 at 02:57:18: you can best enjoy thinking &amp; the analytical side of the mind when you get enough time not thinking

2022-12-18 at 02:08:06: @emmalsalinas happy bday almost twin!

2022-12-18 at 01:45:41: ya girl can finally more or less do slip-stitch ribbing! took ~30 rows of 7 stitches to figure out how to regulate the yarn tension, but we made it!

2022-12-18 at 01:44:39: it was excellent. just an hour or so now until i’m reunited with my cat and my home….. can’t WAIT. but the train ride home will be nice, it’s not too late and i have a crochet project :D

2022-12-18 at 00:30:53: abt to have an amazing 48 minute flight home

2022-12-16 at 01:23:14: @eIfcup yea that makes sense

2022-12-16 at 01:14:42: @eIfcup woow

2022-12-16 at 00:38:47: @eIfcup so out of character ……. what’s going on

2022-12-16 at 00:36:39: @scrapbookhattie no idea but it’s sick that this is a thing you’ve been doing. sounds rewarding &amp; engaging

2022-12-16 at 00:20:02: 💗 https://t.co/I5Un8j0n7k

2022-12-16 at 00:19:03: i love the indian grandparent mode of showering benediction upon benediction on a grandchild. willing positive outcomes into being - or at least sending positive thought currents into reality

2022-12-16 at 00:15:17: the ripples of joy and excitement that my mother, father, and maternal grandparents reflect back to me after initiation - they give me faith

2022-12-16 at 00:13:52: today is the first birthday i’ve gotten to spend in person with bf after 3.5 years of dating :’) 💗

2022-12-15 at 07:00:19: lay initiation in the morning ☺️ have been feeling a little anxious all day but i trust the currents that brought me here

2022-12-14 at 08:46:10: hello late night tl i am up past my bedtime excited for travels tomorrow &amp; currently washing my hair

2022-12-14 at 02:56:21: first off it’s gotta have a turtleneck. we’re going for warmth n coziness. when i wear this vest i want to feel my body heat reflected back at me big time

2022-12-14 at 02:47:21: got a bunch of yellow 100% wool yarn a while ago with the intention of making a sweater, but i couldn’t find a pattern i liked that worked with the yarn. today a vision arrived in my head of that yarn as a vest. a sunshine-y yellow vest! to the drawing board! :)

2022-12-13 at 20:29:15: making some solutions rn and i fr feel like a child again 😭🥰 look how crystalline and sparkly this magnesium chloride is https://t.co/s7SOs4ddIF

2022-12-13 at 18:19:14: the last time this theme / feeling arose within me was during my august visit home. when i was with my dad at the gym there was a moment where we made eye contact and i felt i could see his essence, who he was behind his eyes, and how i was like him

2022-12-13 at 18:16:45: considering releasing this intention. the thing i have to do is dependent on experiencing high valence states relating to a specific theme/archetype. these states naturally arise but cannot be forced

2022-12-13 at 16:41:32: like i’ll be plasma cleaning some glass to coat with a solution that makes cells want to stick to the glass; i made that solution yesterday but i made it in the wrong way and so it didn’t work. cells still looked cool tho

2022-12-13 at 16:40:25: by experiment i mean i have cells and i am doing things to them and observing them under 100x magnification. this is a dramatic oversimplification, there are so many things to control for &amp; consider &amp; even just ways of doing things

2022-12-13 at 16:37:02: day 2 of doing an experiment at work &amp; i feel sooo much more confident and good in my body than i did yesterday!

2022-12-12 at 16:30:30: there she be https://t.co/wtwssAdPcS

2022-12-12 at 16:27:11: this morning i accidentally noticed the moon high in the sky, setting in the west. i think this is the first time i’ve noticed the moon being present during the morning

2022-12-12 at 03:52:31: aromatics / tomatoes / stewin’/ stewed https://t.co/2yBeRLVQpS

2022-12-12 at 02:48:45: making back to back stews to get through a big butternut squash &amp; to get into the festive spirit 🥰

2022-12-12 at 00:44:07: my creative endeavor for this evening: working on protocol for an experiment tomorrow. it is so fun to carefully lay plans &amp; think on behalf of my future self!

2022-12-11 at 23:07:01: @profeshkitten this tweet made doubly funny by your employment in wine industry

2022-12-11 at 20:46:15: i used more liquid/vegetable broth than in the recipe n smooshed the veggies a bit after pressure cooking to get a soupy texture

2022-12-11 at 20:45:35: made this stew in my instant pot fri night and finishing the last of it off now. highly recommend! it was so warm and hearty. i’ve been having rice + stew + half an avocado on top &amp; it is 🤌🏽 https://t.co/F5j2oF8zxS

2022-12-11 at 18:15:52: not me re-inventing tapasya 😂🙈 https://t.co/N1VNfDiDOG

2022-12-11 at 18:08:19: regardless i think it is so very important &amp; good that i don’t feel alone on this path

2022-12-11 at 18:07:33: some of my cannabis related self-talk is quite harsh &amp; uncharitable. grateful for bf and his role as a sounding board over time. i’m reassured that over time i will sort out my relationship to the substance (or it will be sorted out for me, in a way i cannot yet perceive)

2022-12-11 at 17:56:12: oh the bliss of remaining engaged in action

2022-12-11 at 02:06:23: @er1enney0ung https://t.co/132CwGnveC

2022-12-10 at 21:45:07: @eIfcup omg i am so glad to hear it! yay for holistic healthcare

2022-12-10 at 21:41:39: seeing a stranger’s kind eyes on the train a few afternoons ago was a warm moment that affected the rest of my commute home &amp; i’m still thinking about it

2022-12-10 at 21:30:44: @sadalsvvd one cue from yoga class for chest opening when standing or sitting - imagine your armpits are lifting. really helps me lift my chest

2022-12-10 at 05:43:30: @embryosophy @profeshkitten @nopranablem for sure! :)

2022-12-10 at 05:43:14: today i gratitude journaled 😌

2/14

2022-12-10 at 05:39:16: @profeshkitten @nopranablem i agree!

2022-12-10 at 05:25:05: @er1enney0ung if u get to it

2022-12-10 at 05:23:41: roommate has requested a pair of crochet fingerless gloves. which one do we like more aesthetically? https://t.co/LbOFyuQKFG

2022-12-09 at 19:23:33: yesterday i gratitude journaled 💗

1/14

2022-12-09 at 19:18:12: @PrinceVogel hell yeah

2022-12-09 at 19:17:31: for posterity this is the grippy state i was in. when my mind gets like this it feels like a mythological beast, head eating tail, multi-headed, hydra-like https://t.co/EyioRcOP6Z

2022-12-09 at 19:15:39: the mind *likes* to concentrate, we just forget this &amp; wonder why approaching the world with a distracted mind makes us feel terrible :)

2022-12-09 at 19:14:23: ok but note to self, the way out of ur grippy &amp; excessive thoughts was not a) reading &amp; putting more ideas into psyche or b) pouring excess thought into journaling or writing

rather, it was a concentrated mind performing ur morning routine, allowing thoughts to arise n dissolve

2022-12-09 at 19:11:04: @tasshinfogleman love this thread, your creativity never fails to surprise me!

2022-12-09 at 19:09:07: heart SO full yay for friends and high quality social interaction and good faith and hope and steadfastness

2022-12-09 at 19:04:51: this just in @br___ian next week get ur birthday wishes ready 🌊🏄‍♂️✨

2022-12-09 at 18:59:01: @embryosophy :)) thank you! it’s gonna be a good one

2022-12-09 at 18:42:45: wondering if my christian friends on here can tell me of any sermons that really made an impact on them?

2022-12-09 at 18:25:03: @nickcammarata yes yes yes. just this morning i realized i’ve been stuck in a mode for past few days where i’ve been clinging to thoughts, over-identifying with thought, and wanting all my thoughts to be ‘good’ ones (bc only then am i Good). so silly

2022-12-09 at 18:01:41: ♥️♥️♥️ https://t.co/bMWfdorfnT

2022-12-09 at 17:51:22: @laudablelies :)) 🤔😊💕

2022-12-09 at 17:16:18: crazy that you can often just articulate what you’re feeling without adding interpersonal ego to it, eg

“i’m feeling anxious about arriving later than we planned to” / “you’re changing the plans in a way i don’t like”

“i want a call :’)”/ “you don’t have time for me”

2022-12-09 at 17:07:41: wow we’re passing thru a corridor of powerful bdays (mine’s coming up next week too 👀😊)

2022-12-09 at 17:04:33: @VividVoid_ happy bday vv! best wishes for the coming year &amp; decade ♥️

2022-12-09 at 16:51:24: @christineist i watched this therapy in a nutshell video about the cortisol awakening response &amp; morning anxiety. had you heard of it? i don’t always feel cleansed, sometimes emotions carry over https://t.co/S5HavYKJEL https://t.co/2IB9aMzuRN

2022-12-09 at 16:47:29: @christineist yes! there’s a definite cleansing aspect of being reborn every day. i think that’s what gives me hope

2022-12-09 at 06:25:33: porcini pizza, a blunt, amanita, and then we’re gonna make cookie dough

2022-12-09 at 04:19:19: ehehe at friend’s apt and she’s making porcini pizza 🍕

2022-12-09 at 00:23:38: as per your worldview, why do we experience discomfort? what good comes from bearing discomfort?

2022-12-08 at 22:51:06: i’ve only read the first 100 pages of glass bead game but one thing i deeply appreciated was the depiction of angst &amp; internal turmoil even while following one’s path

2022-12-08 at 21:20:40: i love my love’s soft heart. may we remain soft-hearted

2022-12-08 at 21:05:00: @embryosophy :)) wanna get on a call sometime soon?

2022-12-08 at 20:36:27: @tasshinfogleman oh tasshin i would love to! so many things to choose from, let me see which feels like it could be interesting to you. my hope would be that i can transmit my wonder &amp; curiosity to you while explaining!

2022-12-08 at 20:28:47: @embryosophy dude we have to compare notes on membranes sometime, my work / field involves thinking about forces propagating in membranes &amp; membrane curvature &amp; how that plays into signaling

2022-12-08 at 20:07:17: the teaching on this that speaks to my heart - ‘jonomo morono’ by parvathy baul https://t.co/8nidQ7JPLg

2022-12-08 at 20:04:10: i really like the idea that we are born every morning and die every night

☀️ it brings me hope and wonder that we are reborn every morning

🌙 dying every night provides a healthy sense of urgency

curious if this idea is meaningful for you, &amp; how it appears in your daily life

2022-12-08 at 18:52:20: RT @startingfromnix: You crave everything at once, and see life as one big feast. You want both discipline and freedom, both stability and…

2022-12-08 at 18:09:36: when my internal dialogue gets messy n contradicting &amp; i instinctually qualify everything, i often reach for zen thought bc i know it has a quieting &amp; grounding effect on me

2022-12-08 at 17:26:30: @DiamonDie your “best way” is different from my “best way”

2022-12-08 at 17:03:03: my friend has a pattern she’s caught in with her parents, where there is misunderstanding &amp; distrust &amp; hurtful things are said. her conceptualization of working through this karma: becoming aware of this pattern, and learning to act outside of it

2022-12-08 at 16:59:46: one way we can perceive karma or its workings is in our interpersonal relationships. i think karma also exists in our relationships with ourselves - what things do you find particularly difficult, scary, challenging?

2022-12-08 at 16:55:27: so, despite not needing to know exactly how karma works - i’m not entirely content with the ultra abstract, detached from my experience of reality, concept of karma

so i raise you this next line of thinking

2022-12-08 at 16:52:53: this was an example that stuck with me, of revealing the essence of a thing. like, sigh of relief, “right, that’s why we’re doing this”)

2022-12-08 at 16:45:34: (i’m reminded of this youtuber i watched while setting up obsidian, he was a grad student and emphasized - yes let’s set up this tool, it’ll be great, but the *point* is not to have the best set-up, but rather to support your pursuit of knowledge &amp; understanding…

2022-12-08 at 16:43:42: but that’s the thing, the point is not to understand &amp; reveal the workings of karma to the rational mind. we don’t need to know exactly how karma works (though sometimes the idea can provide peace - in difficult times, “i am working through my karma”)

2022-12-08 at 16:32:11: through our past, present, and future lives we are tasked with working through &amp; releasing the karma we have produced

who’s to say the exact timescale it works on. i think in one life you could be affected by karma from many lives ago &amp; also from something earlier in this life

2022-12-08 at 16:28:35: and what constitutes action? a thought is an action too. thoughts send out ripples in your psyche and in collective consciousness. so thoughts seem like they generate karma too

2022-12-08 at 16:26:52: often karma is thought to be “the result of the things you do” when in truth, karma is generated when you act with attachment to the outcome; you cease to produce karma as you learn how to act without attachment, raising your effort to God

2022-12-08 at 16:24:47: book club last night got me thinkin about how we can begin to recognize interpersonal karmic patterns, and for the relationships &amp; dynamics that cause us the most grief, move towards acting without attachment

2022-12-08 at 00:11:45: @myceliummage u kno i’ve done a buncha stuff but adderall i just don’t wanna fuck with

2022-12-07 at 22:48:06: today i will begin a few full moon sadhanas!

2022-12-07 at 22:45:27: @VividVoid_ beautifully put, thank you for this vv

2022-12-07 at 22:34:18: @gptbrooke long distance being over &amp; coming home to bf’s warm body and comforting presence every night

2022-12-07 at 18:45:33: checked off every item on my grocery list 😊 now to go to the yarn store!

2022-12-07 at 01:39:52: @tasshinfogleman i think i might become the sort of person with unshakable faith in God

2022-12-07 at 01:15:34: this parallels arjuna’s dilemma at kurukshetra

2022-12-07 at 01:15:07: from gospel of matthew: for he who would save his life will lose it, but he who loses his life for my sake will find it ♥️

2022-12-07 at 00:55:28: what is it you need in order to be more grounded in your Self (that limitless, expansive thing we call Brahman or God)

2022-12-06 at 21:00:02: @TheGrandBlooms i did used to enjoy cognitive function theory tho, is that something you’re familiar with? it’s a theory that underlies/goes hand in hand with mbti

2022-12-06 at 20:57:34: @TheGrandBlooms hm it’s a good question but not one i have an immediate answer to. i don’t think adding a pair of letters would necessarily make mbti a better descriptor

2022-12-06 at 19:58:20: @TheGrandBlooms infj used to be more into it several years ago but felt that none of the descriptions fit me as well as i’d like them to

2022-12-06 at 19:37:51: i realize now that a few cues in yoga have been calling for quadricep contraction and the reciprocal hamstring lengthening

eg, in a standing forward fold with legs together or wide legged forward bend - grip knees up; open back of the thigh / push center of thigh back

2022-12-06 at 19:34:33: also came across the concept of reciprocal inhibition, which says that for muscles on one side of a joint to relax &amp; lengthen, the muscles on the other side must contract

this means: quadricep contraction accompanies hamstring lengthening

2022-12-06 at 19:10:19: so far i’ve learned that sciatic nerve tension can contribute to that sense of hamstrings being tight - and that the way to relieve nerve tension is different than muscle tension

nerves respond well to gentle stretching, they lack elasticity of muscles. hence, “nerve glides”

2022-12-06 at 19:08:13: my current project is understanding how to increase hamstring flexibility / ability of navel to contact thighs https://t.co/cgF3xRjiaX

2022-12-06 at 02:47:23: @PiquantParvenu or nothing at all! just curious

2022-12-06 at 02:45:17: @PiquantParvenu in my case, with extra estrogen intake i was prescribed progesterone to ‘oppose’ it, so that endometrium wouldn’t keep growing n growing

uncontrolled endometrial proliferation can lead to at worst endometrial cancer but realistically benign polyps

2022-12-06 at 02:43:55: @PiquantParvenu just a thought based on my experience - wondering if you’ve talked with your doctor about the risk of excess endometrial proliferation with more estrogen in your system? this may not apply in your case -

2022-12-06 at 02:41:24: hehe i may get to have two celebrations for my birthday this year :) one in LA, then the next day at home in berkeley :)

2022-12-06 at 02:32:53: and with this i refer to the idea that the left side of your body is the lunar side, and the right is the solar side. this is laid out in maya tiwari’s tremendous resource on ayurvedic healing &amp; vedic living for women, “the path of practice”

2022-12-06 at 02:31:29: the left side of my body has been energetically interesting the past few weeks. pulses in left inner thigh while meditating and after energy healing from my mom. now these new pains from regions that beg for flow of prana… i’m taking this to mean my lunar side is healing…

2022-12-06 at 02:29:38: now that i’ve been doing yoga asanas somewhat regularly for a month, my body keeps surprising me, 

with more vertebrae cracking than ever before; 

with new pains when i don’t do yoga, in my left knee and in my left inguinal ligament

2022-12-06 at 02:25:11: @touchmoonflower perusing… https://t.co/8CSRtNVgRq

2022-12-05 at 19:38:33: @er1enney0ung @strangestloop boyf got me a “she pee” for a past bday…… they exist. have i ever used it? no

2022-12-05 at 19:37:04: there is a certain secret thing i have to do before my birthday (in 10 days!), which i’ve been intending to do for the past few months. i will update below when i do it!

2022-12-05 at 18:50:44: i love dealing with the neighborhood mechanic. they’re trustworthy and kind and after every interaction i feel as though i’ve gotten a dose of healthy &amp; upstanding masculinity

2022-12-05 at 17:40:01: thinking about a march or april 2023 roadtrip pilgrimage to santa fe

2022-12-05 at 17:01:37: mmmf my heart is feeling so ready and excited for diksha and japa

2022-12-04 at 01:41:37: @hormeze feels like 4 songs in 1 song, i just love the energy. gives me all sorts of body tingles. v fun to move to https://t.co/XwaLhR2BCV

2022-12-04 at 01:37:55: @hormeze i am particularly fond of techno. i generally like dancing to house too. my introduction to electronic music was dark psytrance 😅 other stuff too! not a fan of dnb cuz i haven’t figured out how to move to it 

i’ll link a few songs i like below

2022-12-03 at 11:20:50: @petrichor_lull how did u end up with extra energy now?

2022-12-03 at 11:18:12: @petrichor_lull i'm still in "savor this state" mode when perhaps i should be in "getting body ready for sleep mode". well, as i type this i just sat in bed with a heating pad and the sleepiness is beginning to appear

2022-12-03 at 10:42:00: who’s up i have far too much energy for this time of night

2022-12-03 at 10:18:06: wouldn’t be a matilda night out without an audio tweet for y’all https://t.co/o38uv4SDHi

2022-12-03 at 01:17:32: @leahprime yessss to eudaimonia! i think this may be the first time i’ve seen it mentioned in my twittering. i came across the concept in this podcast episode a few months ago and it really struck me https://t.co/krOtIGPJum

2022-12-03 at 00:11:10: more thinking on these intertwined paths:

🔸science - refining the rational mind
🔹spirituality - recognizing limits of rational mind, also purifying the rational mind, developing the subconscious

2022-12-01 at 06:04:04: @responsiblparty i have never liked jazz, unfortunately, so it was not super enjoyable. neutral experience. i felt like i was sitting there - trapped in a seated body - and listening to psychedelic contemplation music. was with good friends though

2022-12-01 at 03:01:05: @sadalsvvd also i swear the energetic feeling of the ring is different depending on which side i wear on top (bigger stone on top/bottom)

2022-12-01 at 02:58:45: @sadalsvvd i just got a new ring too and i am obsessed! mine makes me feel powerful. how does ur ring(s) make you feel? https://t.co/qVPvM1yfqN

2022-12-01 at 02:27:58: @TheGrandBlooms :) i like to talk about the experience of training to be a scientist, hinduism, books i’m readin, all manner of thoughts and feelings as they arise

2022-12-01 at 01:23:19: @responsiblparty it was an afternoon at an outdoor venue and he jazz improvises extensively live and it was basically my first time hearing him. it was a lot

2022-12-01 at 01:19:35: @flimsyfloppus what kinda beans n what preparation

2022-12-01 at 01:19:14: @responsiblparty first time i took 2cb was at a thundercat concert. i had no idea what i was in for

2022-11-30 at 23:46:25: @flimsyfloppus oho i don’t know that specific part, could you send the verse(s)?

2022-11-30 at 23:44:09: @startingfromnix hehe i read this and i was like yes! i have this! thank u for helping me discover words for a strength i have

2022-11-30 at 23:36:12: but anyways. excited about pelvic floor awareness bc i can feel myself beginning to visualize a complex system and dayum is it satisfying

2022-11-30 at 23:34:57: @scrapbookhattie god’s gf reminds me of krishna and his milkmaids. there is a mode of krishna worship that involves thinking of as quasi romantic beloved! just thought i’d mention if of interest

2022-11-30 at 23:33:15: @TheGrandBlooms hi i think we would have fun interacting as mutuals!

2022-11-30 at 23:31:34: and let me tell you! when i explain my work, i often start with “imagine the cell as a sphere of fluid”. and that works. but it’s not a sphere at all. it’s got all sorts of microcurvature. in some cells there are accordion-like membrane RUFFLES

2022-11-30 at 23:29:35: this year i discovered that i looooove when pictures of complex things come together in my head. the first thing i felt this for was the cell. envisioning the physical reality of the cell - the composition &amp; structure of membrane, covered w dense forest of surface receptors

2022-11-30 at 23:25:19: yesterday i became aware of my pelvic floor for the first time ever and i can’t wait to develop my understanding by looking at diagrams and experimenting with exercises and, above all, leaning into my own awareness

2022-11-30 at 23:23:19: @scrapbookhattie honestly ya. i’m a fan of any conceptualization of god that allows for personalization of god. cuz that’s what u need to have!

2022-11-30 at 23:19:07: RT @scrapbookhattie: im gods girlfriend

2022-11-30 at 22:59:45: safe way to get ur novelty kicks - extend ur normal neighborhood walk or running route by a few streets. providing the eyes and all the senses something fresh to perceive

2022-11-30 at 22:53:43: methinks a scalp massage and braiding my hair when i get home after my walk

2022-11-30 at 22:50:09: @startingfromnix this is sooo cool! it really spoke to me. i just read something that feels similar - about shakti-prana or feminine life force, and how to live our lives to be most in touch with that force

on a walk now but will share a page or two when back!

2022-11-30 at 22:44:28: when u are on a walk u can stop in whichever patch of sunlight you’re caught in and just stay there for however long u like soaking it in

2022-11-30 at 22:41:44: shortly i’ll be to the end of my current combustible cannabis supply, save for the remnants of a “fatboy” joint filled with a strain called “devil’s spit”

2022-11-30 at 19:23:43: @nickcammarata i have not, thanks for rec

2022-11-30 at 01:19:25: @relic_radiation 🔥 duly noted! hope to visit your neck of the woods someday

2022-11-30 at 01:02:17: @AdamInProgress would love to talk more about experiences meditating with cannabis

2022-11-30 at 01:01:26: @AdamInProgress screenshot of how i felt then https://t.co/3J7INbevEM

2022-11-30 at 01:00:05: @AdamInProgress eventually ego reasserted itself for me too and i’ve been exploring how to re enter that state of everyday existing again

2022-11-30 at 00:58:57: @AdamInProgress this lasted for weeks and was triggered by a number of things, one of which was reading an explanation of the ego (in a ram dass book) that clicked at a deeper level

2022-11-30 at 00:58:02: @AdamInProgress interesting to hear this description, echoes an experience i had earlier this year - not with feeling prana or vayus but rather i was able to identify the ego level of my experience. suddenly a lot of negative ideation just fell away and life became far more easeful

2022-11-30 at 00:56:22: @AdamInProgress so cool! how were you exposed to the thing that rang true at a deep level?

2022-11-30 at 00:54:50: @wordvoid i’ve been turned a little off of psychedelics as of late (did a lot of them in 2021) but it’s helpful to hear of circumstances where they support spiritual growth

2022-11-30 at 00:52:19: @wordvoid vvv cool. “once you seefeel, it becames identifiable in other ways” rings true for me

2022-11-30 at 00:48:01: @minobenjo 🙏🏽 yes! thank you for these words

2022-11-30 at 00:46:03: @BillyBuffington @RomeoStevens76 wow, noted! would’ve never thought of 5meo for this purpose. haven’t tried it

2022-11-30 at 00:44:59: @stefantking thank you for this empirical information! heartening as i begin to establish an asana practice. are there specific energy flows (eg vayus) you recall feeling / do you remember circumstances in which the feeling arose?

2022-11-30 at 00:42:45: @neuralkn0t thank u for empirical information :) curious about your everyday experience of energy flows - and if this experience (everyday or 💊) falls within a specific framework (qi? body meridians? etc etc)

2022-11-30 at 00:33:18: @MeghanCarron actively working on establishing such a practice in my life :) started taking iyengar classes a few weeks ago. out of curiosity, do you have a regular yoga practice &amp; if so 1) what kind, and 2) what is your awareness of prana/energy flows like?

2022-11-30 at 00:31:44: @LizNix thank you for your input :)

2022-11-30 at 00:31:04: @LizNix i haven’t tried sensory deprivation; and i haven’t been practicing all that long. i take comfort in the motion that “you know it when you feel it”. similar to some herbal healing i’m undertaking. i’ll know it’s working at some point down the line, because i’ll feel it

2022-11-30 at 00:28:02: @dancinghorse16 very cool, thanks for the empirical information :)

2022-11-30 at 00:26:06: @gmamoon888 what, specifically, did you feel, and has your awareness of energy flows expanded since then?

2022-11-30 at 00:25:34: @gmamoon888 i believe it! a friend of mine did a goenka retreat and described how each day involved attuning to progressively more subtle sensations

2022-11-30 at 00:24:24: @zencephalon i feel a little resistance to incorporating a qi gong practice into my life as i’m actively working on developing a yoga practice and it feels like maybe too much at once. but can’t hurt to try :)

2022-11-30 at 00:23:12: @zencephalon very cool, thank you for pointing me in the direction of eight silk brocades! (often a keyword can be tremendously helpful)

2022-11-30 at 00:13:21: @wholebodyprayer ♥️♥️♥️🔥

2022-11-29 at 23:26:05: @relic_radiation vvv interesting. curious how this aspect of the working theory came into being?

2022-11-29 at 23:25:22: @relic_radiation i can’t immediately think of anything but will reflect on it &amp; observe. i appreciate the ‘using the big sensations as a doorway to notice the smaller ones’ idea, it seems like a more accessible way in

2022-11-29 at 23:08:47: @wholebodyprayer i am taking an initiation in a few weeks and looking forward to any form of shaktipat transpiring, though i don’t know what to expect. perhaps that is the fun of it

2022-11-29 at 23:06:50: @wholebodyprayer fascinating! i’m particularly interested in perspectives from your cosmos as hinduism is my path. i’ve seen the term shaktipat but as always illuminating to hear your description

2022-11-29 at 19:08:52: can’t deny there’s a part of me that wants to learn how to do this https://t.co/BHDCpOvszc

2022-11-29 at 17:18:05: the bright side of having abysmally tight hamstrings is that any pose i stay in long enough to open them up a bit makes them feel amazing upon release - literally a magical surge of openness and sparkling in my legs

2022-11-29 at 05:31:43: @responsiblparty wild that this exists, thank you for linking. have you gone thru it?

2022-11-29 at 05:05:52: @FractalAuth you too!

2022-11-29 at 05:02:16: tagging people who i think would have interesting &amp; illuminating thoughts on this: @kbala444 @relic_radiation @embryosophy @responsiblparty @AdamInProgress @tasshinfogleman @nopranablem @sadalsvvd @nickcammarata

2022-11-29 at 04:56:00: my working model has been something like “you meditate enough and become attuned to subtle body things enough (thru yoga, bodywork, etc) and then eventually u become aware of these flows”. but i’m not convinced and imagine there must be better models out there

2022-11-29 at 04:54:05: so real talk, how does one begin to notice &amp; directly experience energy flows in the body? e.g. flows of prana or qi, as depicted in images https://t.co/zgU0P8KTaZ

2022-11-29 at 04:40:56: thinking about line from a book - sadhana is about learning to love planting the seed as much if not more than reaping what you sow

2022-11-29 at 01:51:11: 2 cont’d) 
but if i had a lil more weight on me, body would feel hunger n be like o i got stores i’m chilling i can handle this

2022-11-29 at 01:50:30: i think gaining weight would:

1) help me feel less cold
2) affect the way hunger sits in my body. i hypothesize that since i’m ~skinny, when i get hungry my body panics &amp; i get headache etc, and this is it’s like “ahh no more energy! neeeed fooood”

2022-11-29 at 01:46:35: for the first time in my life i have the desire to try and gain some amount of weight. maybe 10-20 pounds. i have no idea how to go about doing this 😅 i typically eat v simple ayurvedic food, and exercise regularly w yoga and running

2022-11-29 at 01:38:50: @embryosophy n anyone else w experience?

2022-11-29 at 01:38:24: sooo how would one hypothetically go about starting to learn sanskrit / dev nagari

2022-11-29 at 01:37:22: writing out my plans for rest of evening, somehow the thing i need to do *most* (science work) is the one i remember last. clear sign my psyche is avoiding it. delightful to notice ways in which māyā shrouds experience of reality

2022-11-29 at 01:26:30: @noampomsky reminds me of murakami in what i talk abt when i talk abt running. how he transitions from jazz bar late hours phase of life to countryside life which is optimal for supporting novel writing. which could be interpreted as boring

2022-11-28 at 23:42:40: about to drop $$$ on yoga props

2022-11-28 at 21:52:18: u gotta stop grasping “i need to do xyz” and shift that energy into the doing of the thing

2022-11-28 at 20:54:52: i am cautiously optimistic. i know i just have to put a little time and thinking into it each day, and eventually i will be pleasantly enraptured by the subject matter. and that rapture &amp; love &amp; curiosity will move me forward in the way i am currently unable to move

2022-11-28 at 20:30:53: i have some accumulated dread and fear and a part of me that feels like i’m a failure, to contend with :’)

2022-11-28 at 20:26:11: this afternoon i will be getting back into thinking about my science work for the first time in weeks 🙈

2022-11-28 at 20:24:37: my humbled heart trundles forward at the natural pace of life

2022-11-28 at 20:22:40: in response to that paralyzing anxiety, that stagnant energy that fears that i will never be happy, productive, in flow - to that i say that all i must do is to do what must be done

2022-11-28 at 16:17:36: body is not strong enough at present to go for runs. i miss running! haven’t been able to since end of oct

2022-11-28 at 04:31:25: life becomes engaging and absorbing as you find things to devote yourself to

2022-11-28 at 04:30:50: i forget that often all you have to do is to take the first step and then the universe will help you along

2022-11-21 at 23:42:48: twitter is my platform for sharing and reading those nuggets of insight derived from spelunking into one’s inner depths

2022-11-21 at 23:39:51: sometimes lists of tasks are exactly what i need. like a checklist written the night before, of things to do before an early departure. but today i was lacking in momentum &amp; my list of tasks wasn’t getting me anywhere

2022-11-21 at 23:38:43: turns out following the directive “getting myself physically and emotionally ready for my family’s arrival tomorrow” is far more useful and motivating than a list of tasks

2022-11-21 at 19:08:58: @jacasiegel beautiful photos! the tenderness and love in your relationship is evident 🥰

2022-11-17 at 04:40:59: okay now for real. a little meditation first, to clear my channel. thanks for your patience!

2022-11-16 at 22:42:08: beautiful piece https://t.co/xB5pTkqzaw

2022-11-16 at 19:27:03: @FractalAuth :) i’m preparing to take a spiritual initiation which will mean i’ll be under the guidance of a teacher. i am so excited! i oscillate between feeling ready and not ready but i do feel dharmically aligned

2022-11-16 at 19:25:25: i have to internalize that eating sugar generally doesn’t make me feel good 😤 i ate just under 1/4 cup of ice cream last night and got a headache. the night prior i had a “digestive” biscuit with tea and got a milder headache

2022-11-16 at 18:23:27: perhaps we will have to be more proactively pro-social. which i know we can do 💪🏽

2022-11-16 at 18:23:14: perhaps the custom of going to your friends’ profiles every once in a while, scrolling and catching up and liking a whole series of tweets - will become more important too

2022-11-16 at 18:11:04: acts of service is a love language i love to give but altho i appreciate receiving it it isn’t my #1. it’s like my number #4 lol.

2022-11-16 at 18:05:59: ok lol 2 years later i’m down for everything except for roller blading and modern dance. i don’t feel like i need to do either in this lifetime ahaha

2022-11-16 at 18:04:57: some fun ideas about the engaging the body in asanas i’ve heard in this first 1.5 weeks of classes:

• widening your collarbone as your shoulders draw back and down
• engaging the legs by drawing the thighs back and the buttocks in - learning how to do both at the same time

2022-11-16 at 18:01:24: RT @lilaexpt: so many things i want to try with this body — roller blading, yin yoga, tai chi, modern dance, belly dancing, running barefoo…

2022-11-16 at 17:24:04: earlier on in my spiritual journey i longed for unshakeable faith in God and i thought that this was trivial. turns out it isn’t - even my spiritual idols, like swami vivekananda - doubted along the way

2022-11-16 at 05:26:02: @____keh all r lovely, especially love warm expansive grandma vibes from straw hat one :’)

2022-11-16 at 03:05:26: if you’re into swami vivekananda pls let me know, i’m reading a biography of his rn and really enjoying it!!!

2022-11-16 at 03:04:06: gonna get to these after dinner! :)

2022-11-16 at 03:02:46: new mental tool in my toolbox: labeling “i’m thinking about x” as a way to stop contributing mental energy to ruminations about x is so frickin useful

2022-11-16 at 02:39:50: co-regulating with nature &amp; the season by going for a walk after a day spent mostly inside

2022-11-16 at 02:15:14: 700 follower special part 2 ☀️

reply for a passage of a book from my home, let’s see if i’m guided to anything of serendipitous interest for you :)

inspired by @sadalsvvd 🪐

2022-11-16 at 02:10:25: @minhwrites so good! v relatable - esp not too much sweet &amp; not scrolling phone first thing in morning (creates so much mental clutter!). curious if there’s a specific time(s) of day you end up having calls w family/close friends?

2022-11-16 at 02:06:19: 700 hundred followers! thank you for being here :)

been meaning to do this for a while: if we aren’t mutuals but you think we could be great mutuals pls drop a reply below to serve as a conversation starter!

2022-11-16 at 01:46:53: grateful for these next two weeks with minimal work &amp; commuting: to rest, to tune into and learn what promotes my well-being, &amp; to re-establish my enjoyment of cooking and feeding myself

2022-11-16 at 01:42:26: • what do you like for building yourself up if you’re weak or ill? 
• what do you like to make when you’re depressed or otherwise down?
• what dish do you know will create a feeling of warm &amp; well-being within you?

2022-11-16 at 01:41:00: would love ur favorite comfort recipes 🥘🍜🍚

2022-11-15 at 17:33:24: i started taking kanchanar gugglu tablets 2x/day about 2 weeks ago. i sometimes notice that my energetic body feels like it’s tingling after taking this herb. i feel it most in my cheeks &amp; forehead, and around my solar plexus

2022-11-15 at 17:13:37: what albums will you play again and again for your children, so that they may become part of the fabric of who they are? https://t.co/yEHPdv3qIE

2022-11-15 at 17:07:11: ravi shankar’s chants of india was an cd my parents played again and again in the car when i was young. i rediscovered the album recently and i feel both its spiritual power and its ability to transport me to being 5 years old in the back seat of a dodge caravan

2022-11-15 at 03:58:10: boyf n i watching trois couleurs blanc and it is 🔥 so far

2022-11-15 at 01:10:46: currently properly cleaning my room for the first time in a ~week. boy does it feel good to deal with my mess!

2022-11-14 at 22:58:26: the afterglow lasted for a few weeks. sometimes even as i go about my life now i feel i’m only just integrating some of the lessons from that first trip. lessons that can only be integrated through daily living

2022-11-14 at 22:56:53: two years ago today i dropped acid for the first time. i journaled 25 pages, experienced mind and body as separate entities in divine play with one another, saw and spoke to my higher self looking down lovingly at me on this plane

2022-11-14 at 06:58:15: @isosteph if anyone can bring about such a paradigm shift it’s you

2022-11-14 at 06:56:57: tomorrow may be the day i finally finish my first crochet sweater!

2022-11-14 at 04:09:49: @danielthedaring what kinda trees? 🌳🌳🌳

2022-11-13 at 21:02:13: cleaning my car on a sunny sunday while lunch is being made in the instant pot ☀️

2022-11-13 at 17:53:58: @durdfarm which one will you peruse first?

2022-11-13 at 17:46:06: @durdfarm wowww all so niche and relevant!

2022-11-13 at 07:04:03: @responsiblparty aw

2022-11-13 at 05:19:30: @nopranablem aw great to hear! i’ve been experiencing a similar positive effect of physical activity - yoga in my case

2022-11-13 at 04:56:16: hi friends, how’s your spirit this fine saturday night/sunday morning?

2022-11-13 at 03:20:03: @br___ian excellent tweet

2022-11-13 at 03:19:46: @br___ian bruh

2022-11-13 at 03:19:15: food is medicine

2022-11-12 at 21:22:02: making myself a nourishing lunch after a wonderful mid-morning yoga class :)

2022-11-11 at 20:02:23: @relic_radiation kool! i was just curious &amp; wanted to probe a little

2022-11-11 at 04:02:54: @valor_zhang i went to a yoga class that was very gentle and mostly seniors, and got to spend time in relaxing and supported poses

2022-11-11 at 03:45:16: it seems to me that if we don’t pay for blue our tweets will progressively get less exposure. perhaps lists will become even more important?

2022-11-11 at 03:25:43: whenever my relationship to food/cooking is out of whack, the first step is always finding a way to rekindle enjoyment of eating/cooking

2022-11-11 at 03:18:03: my evening project: cleaning and organizing our pantry shelf 💪🏽🥑🍋🥥🥔🍯

2022-11-11 at 03:13:17: this one grew on me - feels like rhythmic white noise https://t.co/IXlWMtCWr3

2022-11-11 at 03:04:57: it is comical how much easier it is to do things once i have satiated hunger. my experience of reality is warmer, the voice/sentiment in my mind more pleasant

2022-11-11 at 03:00:44: imagine tripping with a good friend and u guys do yoga and get into your respective flows and feed off of each other’s energies... 😌🥰

2022-11-11 at 02:59:41: can’t wait til i can hang out with a friend n we can do yoga together

2022-11-11 at 02:30:21: @wholebodyprayer happy birthday! i love when your tweets appear on my timeline. your insights light up my experience of the world. your words feel like distillations of experience and wisdom. :)

2022-11-11 at 02:22:21: tinctures vs teas: which one, administered over time, causes greater effect / build up of a given herb in the body?

2022-11-10 at 18:13:04: scared of being labeled as a difficult patient, scared of them not being receptive, frustrated that i have to do this in the first place

2022-11-10 at 18:02:49: about to call obgyn’s office and advocate for the care i need

2022-11-10 at 07:35:19: @quistydotquist not a thread yet but a first tweet in this direction! https://t.co/LKSs8YD4bz

2022-11-10 at 07:21:56: drank red clover blossom tea today and noticed a headache-like feeling a few sips in - not painful, but more energy in the head - and i also felt my heart racing. i don’t think i’ve had such a noticeable reaction to an herb before!

2022-11-09 at 17:50:44: gonna drink a comforting warm beverage and read about holy mother and then meditate and shower and then call my parents and then i get to meet a friend at our favorite neighborhood coffee place. life isn’t so bad after all huh

2022-11-09 at 17:49:38: nervous system be like 📈👹

2022-11-09 at 17:49:22: it isn’t even 10am and i got myself all worked up in an interaction with a friend. cooling down now, or at least trying to

2022-11-08 at 19:07:53: @goblinodds oh YES

2022-11-08 at 03:42:43: @sadalsvvd guess it’s time to download my metadata and get contact info for people i’ll miss

2022-11-08 at 03:13:46: @sadalsvvd scared that this special place will cease to exist

2022-11-08 at 03:13:28: @sadalsvvd the prospect of making this app fully paid / all the chaos that’s going on since his takeover makes me sad :(

2022-11-08 at 02:24:11: @GoddammitBaz oatmeal!!!

2022-11-07 at 22:44:22: last time i had a significant spiritual/psychological breakthrough was in july of this year - and it profoundly changed my experience of the world for a good 6 weeks. i feel another breakthrough coming on

2022-11-07 at 22:33:45: @Childermass4 aw you are human and that is okay. i feel that seasonal dread creeping up in my spirit too, but with it my resolve  strengthens to get cozy and find ways to enjoy the season ❄️🎄

2022-11-07 at 22:31:25: i would wear the hell out of anything that said “i &lt;3 oatmeal” or “i &lt;3 quinoa”

2022-11-07 at 22:27:30: @umbersorrow :)))

2022-11-07 at 22:13:15: i love getting on twitter n hanging out with my spiritual friends. y’all are truly immeasurably important to me

2022-11-07 at 22:12:38: takeaways from recent health/emotional lows:
- strengthened resolve to seek &amp; nurture high quality friendships with people who have similar values
- desire to center in gratitude always. gratitude makes you happier
- aim for small wins. one day at a time

2022-11-07 at 22:07:11: grateful for the miracle of existence

2022-11-07 at 19:08:33: first class this morning, it was sooo good. my body feels different. the teacher was so kind and gracious. feeling good about this first step on my yoga journey

2022-11-06 at 22:04:25: if you work, what’s your answer - how many hours of work can you consistently do while maintaining good health? https://t.co/jFQTlr6dQX

2022-11-06 at 02:17:22: @quotidiania hehe it’s fun to be needlessly inflammatory sometimes tho

2022-11-06 at 02:17:07: @quotidiania i’m not sure! maybe?

2022-11-06 at 02:08:04: @quotidiania maybe a use case for circle? (idk tho i haven’t figured out how to use mine)

2022-11-06 at 02:07:35: why does this go SO hard. excellent music for shaking the stress and anxious energy out of one’s body https://t.co/Ql7j2D84vr

2022-11-06 at 02:00:42: i have a disproportionate amount of nostalgia for may and june 2020 spent in my one bedroom apartment in baltimore. it was so green, so humid, and i had no idea how life was about to unfold (marvelously)!

2022-11-06 at 01:29:49: @pratibimbana do you have a spinny thing that winds your yarn as you frog?

2022-11-06 at 01:29:05: @br___ian a fun juxtaposition: reminding myself “discomfort is spiritually good to bear”, and also “i have the agency to take action to make myself feel better”

2022-11-06 at 01:22:26: i think this project will be the first one i’ll post on a second instagram account for creative pursuits. will be nice to look back on &amp; will enable me to start testing other people’s patterns! (people often look to see if you have a portfolio/audience)

2022-11-06 at 01:18:42: i couldn’t help but have a little gratitude cry. sometimes things feel divinely placed. maybe i’ll be able to go and start learning as soon as this coming week!

2022-11-06 at 01:17:10: discovered today that there is a really solid yoga studio within easy walking distance of my home. i’m so excited!!! they seem grounded in the spiritual side of yoga too - big thing for me https://t.co/WsjdvVFjiE

2022-11-06 at 01:09:21: the vision for this beanie came together as i sorted through some scrap wool i got from the thrift store a while ago. it’s gonna be so cute!! https://t.co/KjhDX2lDke

2022-11-05 at 22:40:48: finally caught up on love is blind, just got to nancy and bartise’s wedding. please please PLEASE let one of them say no

2022-11-05 at 19:25:48: @PiquantParvenu may your energy find wonderful applications :)

2022-11-05 at 19:23:25: ordered this at the recommendation of someone i trust, very excited to get into it https://t.co/pdgWsMH18A

2022-11-05 at 16:29:51: @quotidiania @forshaper 2) like ray said, saturate hair and scalp with oil. don’t go crazy, it doesn’t take that much oil to saturate. you can leave in for 1h up to overnight (put a towel on your pillow to avoid oil stains). then wash out w shampoo (may need to use a lil extra)

2022-11-05 at 16:28:25: @quotidiania @forshaper i use coconut or sesame oil for my hair. two modes of using - 1) get a little bit onto hands, apply to scalp &amp; hair, comb through hair to distribute. this helps when my hair is a little bit too dry. i add whenever i feel like i need it, can be multiple times in between washes

2022-11-05 at 06:27:56: want baked brie

2022-11-05 at 04:39:05: i’m grateful that psychedelics can help people close to death make peace with it

2022-11-04 at 23:59:04: @br___ian @responsiblparty instagram started showing me content from a barefoot shoe account and i was very down for it. now i can’t stop squinting at normal shoes and thinking about the way they suppress natural toe splay

2022-11-04 at 18:44:01: feelin inspired by @quotidiania’s guitar thread and @nowtheo’s meditationstuff thread

2022-11-04 at 18:42:53: thinkin of livetweeting some of my hobby pursuits. eg crochet sweater project (trust me it’s about to get real exciting), learning how to use my korg minilogue, learning how to use my brand spanking new dj controller :’)

2022-11-04 at 18:39:42: @responsiblparty :)

2022-11-04 at 18:38:57: @responsiblparty i try not to get too specific on the TL but i’m a biologist/baby biophysicist working with mammalian cells

2022-11-04 at 18:37:51: @responsiblparty thank u for asking 🥺

2022-11-04 at 18:37:32: @responsiblparty yeah i haven’t talked extensively with them about feedback. one thing was i felt like i had to say “i don’t know” a lot, which isn’t a bad thing per se. one lab mate cautioned me that a better approach going forward would be to give my best guess

2022-11-04 at 18:35:18: @responsiblparty i also was hoping that afterward i’d feel a release, like that post-exam euphoria in undergrad. i didn’t. my lab mates empathized. they said the difference now is that i can’t just forget everything i learned - i have to fixate on it for the next ~4 years 😅

2022-11-04 at 18:33:16: @responsiblparty my advisor was satisfied and said he was impressed with the degree to which my presentation engaged the audience

2022-11-04 at 18:32:32: @responsiblparty it went fairly well, or as well as it could have gone. i didn’t feel like i killed it, but i did what i needed to do. (i spoke to my dad afterwards and he insisted i should be able to tell myself it was good)

2022-11-04 at 18:30:58: this afternoon’s meeting with my advisor will be an interesting one. planning to mention the health issues i’ve been dealing with &amp; also ask how previous mentees of his have dealt with long distance relationships

2022-11-03 at 21:11:52: if anyone has perspectives they think could help, i will gladly take them. eg is there a bright side to feeling this weighty sadness?

2022-11-03 at 21:07:54: i am feeling big weighty sad, hopeless, dread today, and i believe this is at least in part bc of some hormonal issues. it’s not obvious to me what to do to feel better. riding the wave for now

2022-11-03 at 20:07:51: looks like it’s raining this weekend... perfect weather to stay in and work on my sweater project

2022-11-03 at 02:30:44: in a virtual book club with a bunch of canadians and their voices with their round o’s are so comforting

2022-11-03 at 01:09:29: evidently your digestive agni rises and sets with the sun

2022-11-03 at 00:10:15: the body is a black box. conventional medicine and traditional/holistic medicine each provide a toolbox of knowledge and treatment. both are paths towards insight about our bodies

2022-11-01 at 19:31:31: RT @responsiblparty: is your mind rapt or wrapped?

2022-11-01 at 19:24:55: @FractalAuth @myceliummage i think the message comes thru and i am in full agreement

2022-11-01 at 19:10:53: you can only run on fumes for so long

2022-11-01 at 19:10:00: blessed am i to be on this journey of creating a spiritually sustainable life

2022-11-01 at 17:57:19: @zencephalon thank you sweet zencephalon!

2022-11-01 at 17:57:04: @responsiblparty ☺️😭 thank you!! in the final stretch of preparing now

2022-11-01 at 15:41:12: i’ve been preparing for this for the past almost 2 weeks and i feel strongly i just want to do my group right. explain things well, bring them along this intellectual journey

2022-11-01 at 15:11:37: today’s the big day! :’) i’m giving lab meeting today. 1.5-2 hours of presenting my ideas in front of the group

2022-11-01 at 04:20:17: sometimes i speak or send off a message and i can feel the warm reverberations of the words in my heart space

2022-11-01 at 01:43:00: @quistydotquist ahhh. may there be many more days like this

2022-11-01 at 01:06:27: could i have a glimpse into your heart?

2022-11-01 at 00:59:50: @hormeze sublime, thank you for sharing. i wasn’t aware of this album! the last song is bringing me back to myself - i ended an essay i wrote two years ago with lyrics from “my god is real”

2022-11-01 at 00:31:24: can’t go wrong with ravi shankar to start

2022-10-31 at 23:59:23: @BenRatkaj i’ve only ordered when i have credits or when i want to order a special something for long distance partner

2022-10-31 at 23:58:42: i wonder what it is about hitting “rock bottom” or a local minima that shakes you up and makes you wonder about who you really wanna be

2022-10-31 at 23:23:15: every health crisis i weather takes me through tremendous pain, fear, and uncertainty. it’s all worthwhile so long as i can use what i learn to help others exist more peacefully in their bodies - pain, blood, uncertainty, mortality and all

2022-10-31 at 17:25:26: @er1enney0ung 28/29

2022-10-28 at 23:46:32: @btohtoh sometimes feeling empty is a result of becoming numb. a way out is to find safe ways of feeling things again

2022-10-28 at 16:51:27: feeling called to deepen my knowledge of yoga asanas!

2022-10-28 at 16:43:59: it takes at least 15 minutes to make my oatmeal each morning. 15 perfect minutes for stretching, doing dishes, dancing, reading spiritual texts. whatever i can do to be with myself and tend to my body and spirit

2022-10-28 at 16:08:32: @smallkewlhuman praying for his health. sending a big hug over to you

2022-10-28 at 07:26:23: im so sleepy im almost delirious. its kinda nice tho. i feel spent in a good way

2022-10-28 at 07:25:59: it's starting to come together !!! in the morning we tackle the part of the presentation where i set up specific open questions in the field &amp; some inclinations of ways of approaching 'em

2022-10-28 at 04:06:19: there’s an endless number of herbs i’m curious about. recently: red clover blossom, tulsi, mugwort. some i imagine you’d be able to feel upon one ingestion, maybe some need more. perhaps some people are by nature more attuned to the energy of specific herbs

2022-10-28 at 04:03:38: anyone wanna hang out n imbibe various herbs, primarily in tea format, and then we meditate and afterwards articulate the impressions we have of the herb’s effect on our subtle and physical bodies?

2022-10-28 at 03:39:06: yea i’m alive but wow has the past week of living felt like WORK

2022-10-28 at 03:31:15: big presentation at work next week. i’m realizing it feels super puzzle-like to get my thinking &amp; slides together. it’s not working to put the slides together beginning to end - all i can do is integrate each new idea, each new relevant paper, one by one, into the broader whole

2022-10-27 at 18:07:57: to be clear i do not listen exclusively to synthwave

2022-10-27 at 17:54:49: i’m so excited to reflect on 2022 at the end of this year! i wanted to do the same for 2021, but let the moment pass. you guys have any favorite end-of-year practices or prompts for reflection?

2022-10-27 at 17:50:34: giving my discover weekly a listen, i’ve gotten four consecutive synthwave songs ahaha

2022-10-27 at 17:34:05: i treasure the tubes of lipstick my mom has gotten for me over the years. palladio’s coffee bean is an eternal favorite

2022-10-26 at 22:10:00: making this tonight for dinner with friend who just got back from 6 weeks away ^-^ https://t.co/8YRvHVht17

2022-10-26 at 17:35:45: RT @RomeoStevens76: @lilaexpt How I sleep knowing I get to eat a big bowl of oatmeal in the morning https://t.co/U3cIsa7Lxc

2022-10-26 at 17:35:15: @RomeoStevens76 😭👏🏽 you get it!

2022-10-26 at 16:37:07: re-sharing a piece on morning routines :) i need the reminder, and maybe so do you https://t.co/pUntzVBiDR

2022-10-26 at 16:34:13: can’t believe i get to wake up every morning and eat oatmeal

2022-10-26 at 16:25:42: my inner state has been all sorts of stirred up monday through today... i haven’t been sensitive to eclipses before, but i’m beginning to wonder:::

2022-10-26 at 16:23:38: two states of mind i’m noticing:

(1) sometimes i experience a deep sense of understanding of the purposes of doing things, and it’s effortless, even self-evident. 
(2) other times i question and distrust every decision i make

2022-10-26 at 00:16:21: i wish to be in love with life and its current even when things aren’t going well

2022-10-25 at 02:46:30: moments https://t.co/uErCRMRuBa

2022-10-25 at 01:47:54: stoked to see @_rbeny tonight :)

2022-10-24 at 20:16:49: two layer lunch (there’s sauerkraut under the egg) https://t.co/WYiDCXYILa

2022-10-24 at 17:04:53: feels like this diwali is one of the most enjoyable ones in a long time, in big part because i’m finally comfortable identifying as a hindu :)

2022-10-24 at 16:55:42: ok the plan for my meeting with advisor this afternoon is that there is no plan. i’ll show up with all these ideas and rabbitholes i’ve been pursuing and he will add on to them, rule some out, and point me in new directions

2022-10-24 at 04:47:20: jai ma 🌸🙏🏽🪔 https://t.co/mhGcaKi4aK

2022-10-24 at 04:06:08: @christineist going for a walk and praying out loud; cooking a meal; journaling; running

2022-10-23 at 20:40:44: i decided to listen to my body over the rising tide of thoughts, and as soon as my mind quietened my body spoke shyly and asked if we couldn’t go outside and get some sunshine on our skin

2022-10-23 at 20:16:46: hope i figure it out eventually

2022-10-23 at 20:16:04: currently reconciling santosha (explanation in picture) with sense of “i am not the one in control / i can try and create preconditions for success but life will unfold as it will, perhaps as karmically determined” https://t.co/e8rr1Z6hHo

2022-10-23 at 18:20:30: just sent it with a heartfelt little message ☺️🥰

2022-10-23 at 17:56:36: @tasshinfogleman supa curious

2022-10-23 at 17:44:05: the energetic trace of the food i feel in my body is also just nicer than usual. texture of sprouted grain bread is too damn good!

2022-10-23 at 17:42:40: the energy transfer from the food to my body is just way more rapid. first two or three bites, my mind’s elsewhere but suddenly i’m surprised by how good i feel. i’m starting to believe the digestive system does actually start with chewing &amp; that passage to thru the esophagus

2022-10-23 at 17:39:50: i grabbed some ezekiel sprouted grain bread from the store yesterday, having avo toast now with it, first time trying ezekiel in a while... and goddammit, i can feel the difference between this and the cheaper bread i’ve been getting

2022-10-23 at 17:32:46: this week i made scientific thinking progress through taking notes on papers i wanted to deep dive into, conversations with colleagues, talking to myself on my walk, impassioned ideation and writing on the bus ride home

2022-10-23 at 17:31:15: excited to work and think supa hard this week, building flowy momentum up to my next deliverable (1h progress presentation next next tues)

2022-10-23 at 06:54:17: @profeshkitten yessss!!! chilling in the car now but we’re going back soon and it’ll be electronic and also ukrainian tribal :O 💖

2022-10-23 at 05:46:23: yeah i brought earplugs and even extras if needed

2022-10-23 at 05:44:47: and just like that i’m headed to sf for a rave i decided to go to half an hour ago

2022-10-23 at 02:21:19: this is what my silly soft heart wants for dinner and i cannot deny her https://t.co/rO1YkLn1QC

2022-10-23 at 00:46:42: @wholebodyprayer ahh... felt that in the heart

2022-10-23 at 00:10:00: RT @this_is_silvia: #204. kiss me here, here, and here https://t.co/D0YsvcQxmz

2022-10-22 at 20:56:33: that and a good lunch, fairly good night of sleep, and staying hydrated as i go about my day

2022-10-22 at 20:48:46: my vibes are immaculate today !! it’s the peace that arises from spending time in loving presence with yourself 🤍🌟

2022-10-22 at 19:49:17: @isosteph i have such a strong aesthetic aversion to ":P", had to reply and say as such, even ironically using it is making me recoil. but had to, for the bit

2022-10-22 at 19:46:47: manifesting shiitake mushrooms at the grocery store real hard. last time i went they were all out and i was crestfallen

2022-10-22 at 19:44:13: @isosteph :P

2022-10-22 at 19:42:58: @isosteph here is one olive???

2022-10-22 at 19:41:47: eating these leftovers and they bring me so much joy. so friggin tasty. i cooked the onions and beets to just the right level; the small layer of shredded gouda midway through adds a subtle but delicious flavor; the overall texture is overwhelmingly pleasant

2022-10-22 at 19:01:09: @wife_immaterial hai miss glowy and cozy

2022-10-22 at 17:16:43: i am at higher risk of osteoporosis as i age and for a while this caused great consternation &amp; avoidance. glad to not feel that way anymore - to be able to face reality as it is, and be proactive and have a positive felt-sense about the state of my body

2022-10-22 at 17:15:24: yay for discovering and adding sources of calcium to my diet: goat milk, now chia seed pudding! makes me feel good about providing my bones with what they need

2022-10-22 at 17:02:46: @teleosistem thank you, i will try that orientation :)

2022-10-22 at 16:46:44: craving the soul soothing effect of nature so bad... planning on a trail run this weekend, wanted to go today but don’t want to destroy my legs. we’ll see how i feel after groceries!

2022-10-22 at 16:43:28: when your awareness expands you begin to pay more attention to things. and as you pay more attention things will tell you when they need to be taken care of

2022-10-22 at 06:57:57: 30k steps today my legs feel like jelly

2022-10-22 at 06:54:46: some weekly patterns / rhythms of life that are emerging for me:

wfh wednesdays
laundry on either wed or sat or sun
groceries either wed or sat depending on when i start running low
runs 3x/week, twice during the week once on the weekend
cook mon night and make lunch for tues

2022-10-22 at 06:15:07: i give myself permission to enjoy a slow saturday morning. to wake up and delight in the 8-10am energy. i’ll set an alarm for 8 hours after my bed time. i wish to wake up and hold my awareness in my body, to observe it stretch and lengthen as i move

2022-10-22 at 02:54:48: oki all done! like if you’d wanna hang in spaces sometime &amp; i’ll tag u next time :)

2022-10-22 at 02:41:48: come hang in my space if you’d like

2022-10-22 at 02:39:58: https://t.co/uencMKUCiq

2022-10-22 at 02:08:26: 1. there are a few hobbies/side pursuits we have a feeling it’ll be way funner &amp; easier to do when we’re living together: climbing, gardening, making music

2022-10-22 at 02:03:15: high off meaning

2022-10-22 at 02:03:08: high on meaning

2022-10-22 at 01:46:40: it took me like three youtube searches and starting to watch three videos before i finally found one that gave me the info i wanted.... yay for staying focused on my curiosity!

2022-10-22 at 01:30:47: i should try green tea with less flavonoids... haven't been enjoying green tea lately bc of bitterness/adjacent flavor. and looks like flavonoids could be responsible for that bitterness

2022-10-22 at 01:29:09: current rabbithole on chemical composition of green tea
https://t.co/XGvoHKCfPa

2022-10-22 at 00:26:53: @teleosistem having routine on a daily &amp; weekly scale seems to be huge for allowing this flow ime. curious if tru for u

2022-10-22 at 00:23:23: @teleosistem cool to see this in words. i am somewhere between step 1 and 2 - experienced step 1 in july-august of this year for the first time. i sure would like to know how to get to higher flow in the moment! (or frankly, how to achieve that state i was in earlier this year)

2022-10-21 at 16:15:14: about to take a shower and mmmmmf the warm water is gonna feel so good on my slightly sore calves and tense shoulders

2022-10-21 at 16:07:55: @tasshinfogleman 🤍🤍🤍

2022-10-21 at 05:59:49: @myceliummage hallo how’s it hangin in berlin

2022-10-21 at 03:07:34: might have to replicate this meal when bf is in town next week... teehee i love my evolution into gf who can cook 👩🏽‍🍳🌟

2022-10-21 at 02:59:59: both the frittata and fries turned out flawlessly 🙌🏽

2022-10-20 at 23:34:05: okay i think i'm gonna make golden beet frittata and japanese sweet potato fries for dinner. feels like something's missing, don't know what tho!

2022-10-20 at 17:10:14: i ♥️ the bay. glad my work and education choices have tethered me here for at least half a decade. every day my identity further intertwines with this landscape. i am coming to a deep way of knowing this place, and what “deep knowing” looks like is unique to each of us

2022-10-20 at 17:04:30: the bay reflects the color of the sky, and so some days it’s a striking metallic baby blue, and other days the water is an expansive white surface, mirroring the overcast skies. it’s always beautiful

2022-10-20 at 17:02:43: i’m beginning to hear the rhythm of sentences again... this bodes well!

2022-10-20 at 17:02:09: back right seat of the bus is my cozy space. it’s excellent for alone time. love sitting here and reading or crocheting or just existing, and when we cross the bridge i can look a ways north to sausalito and beyond. on clear days i can see the golden gate bridge

2022-10-20 at 15:17:57: to qualify: i think coming to understand “all” biology through one’s rational mind is unrealistic. however i believe you can also come to know biology in a non-linear way, through experiences of near-spiritual insight &amp; development of intuition

2022-10-20 at 15:07:37: pls pardon my use of the wrong “it’s”

2022-10-20 at 15:07:12: biology has this mystical quality to it. its unfathomably complex. i think part of the joy of studying biology is its elusiveness, its fractal complexity; you don’t go into biology trying to understand *all* biology, that’s just unreasonable

2022-10-20 at 15:04:55: there’s some part of me that shuts down when someone expresses a specific sort of reductionist belief system: eg “if we understand all anatomy we would perfectly understand all biology”

2022-10-19 at 23:22:27: i’ve been considering making beanies for people i care for who live far away in colder climates. maybe i will make a project out of it. 3 beanies, 3 letters

2022-10-19 at 23:21:06: i know seeing a crochet project from start to finish will be extraordinarily good for getting my creative energy flowing...

2022-10-19 at 23:15:39: thanks all for your responses, keep them coming! i’ll have time to respond later tonight :)

2022-10-19 at 19:42:15: i could:

- hike
- journal at the park
- read ramakrishna at the park
- read vivekananda at the park

2022-10-19 at 19:35:28: it’s nice out ☀️ and i have a free afternoon and it’s my wfh day ••• seeking ideas for activities to do to enjoy some time outdoors

2022-10-19 at 19:20:14: i really enjoy incorporating greens into my diet despite not knowing exactly what benefit they provide

2022-10-19 at 05:18:53: where does tension accumulate in your body?

2022-10-19 at 05:13:43: @hamzaiandafirst happy to share more info over dms - i don’t know everything about ayurveda but might have some pointers

2022-10-19 at 05:10:29: @tasshinfogleman ❤️ i feel it!

2022-10-19 at 05:10:01: @joespurpleshirt ❤️🥺 thank you jane! hope you and nyla are doing well 💗

2022-10-18 at 19:42:26: @yokaihainen tweets about one’s phd advisor are a favorite subgenre of mine

2022-10-18 at 19:14:25: i love creating ripples in the collective consciousness hehe

2022-10-18 at 19:08:53: “both husband and wife had their minds attuned to the Infinite” 🤍 what a wonderful ideal for marriage &amp; partnership https://t.co/RFxhNSJ99r

2022-10-18 at 19:05:49: next chapter titled “finding divinity in the wife” has my heart melting with how sri ramakrishna took on his duties as husband. the love and care he showed holy mother!

2022-10-18 at 18:49:07: below, what’s required imo for progress in science and in spirituality. grateful i get to cultivate these things through my intertwined paths

🔸 science - curiosity &amp; execution
🔹 spirituality - depth of love/devotion &amp; practice

2022-10-18 at 18:42:49: on the chapter now where he realizes god through various faiths. his profound experiences of islam and christianity are so cool to read about. his capacity for divine love, devotion, and one-pointedness are incredible

2022-10-18 at 18:40:25: currently reading a book on the life of sri ramakrishna, really enjoying it

2022-10-18 at 18:30:59: @nickcammarata so wild how awakening - that process of letting go - strengthens personality. i wouldn’t have believed you until i experienced it for myself

2022-10-18 at 18:26:31: @taalumot 🤍🤍🤍 the truth of “undergo both extremes... and then get up and do it again”

2022-10-18 at 18:24:45: roommate paid my cooking a tremendous compliment last night. her stomach often hurts after meals. she said that her stomach never hurts after eating the food i make 😭 this ayurvedic cooking thing must be working huh

2022-10-18 at 18:04:17: @thecreatorkat ☺️💕

2022-10-18 at 17:33:18: looking forward to my run this evening and an hour or two of nice deep thinking afterward

2022-10-18 at 17:32:12: omg it’s gonna be 80 degrees in berkeley tomorrow!

2022-10-18 at 17:15:53: had a nice call with bf ^-^ we imagined reading together at night when we live together. also, we got optimistic about the day ahead - aim for small wins to create momentum

2022-10-18 at 16:44:14: a hug and reassurance (that i am capable and loved, that today will be better than yesterday) would go a long ways

2022-10-18 at 16:39:38: @profeshkitten last photo has some heart wrenching quality to it. makes me think of growing older &amp; coming closer to mortality

2022-10-18 at 16:38:10: @profeshkitten pleasure from the vibrance of the orange and its complementarity to the shade of green

2022-10-18 at 16:37:21: bf and i both being grad students means that there are shared experiences &amp; struggles we both understand or are coming to understand

yesterday he put into words a feeling i was having - becoming frazzled bc of the overwhelmingness of unknowns

2022-10-18 at 02:04:56: @pratibimbana absolutely baffled at that one tbh but i love it for you

2022-10-18 at 02:04:08: @pratibimbana i’m with u on all but bullet point 2

2022-10-18 at 01:36:25: &gt; connects with indian heritage while learning to cook 
&gt; yay there are so many choices of daals! masoor, toor, chana, urad, moong...
&gt; gets into ayurveda
&gt; moong is supreme. masoor is good too. all the others r bad

2022-10-18 at 01:24:42: @gptbrooke really loved this one. felt it. he has a beautiful and evocative voice

2022-10-18 at 01:16:27: reply with songs that make u feel like everything’s gonna be okay

2022-10-18 at 01:02:48: @TheGrandBlooms also the next time i cry. craving that feeling of cleansing and catharsis

2022-10-18 at 00:57:01: @TheGrandBlooms hugging bf in two weeks;
hugging family in a little over a month;
getting home tonight and petting my silly little cat and making healing lentil soup and going for a run once my stomach has settled after dinner

2022-10-16 at 16:40:03: theory: one way tripping diminishes your ego is by overriding/overpowering the thoughts with intense physical sensations

2022-10-16 at 05:59:19: gonna see if i can get my friend to sing radhe govinda with me

2022-10-16 at 04:42:11: retweeting cozy things from my media tab 1+ years ago don’t mind meee

2022-10-16 at 04:27:01: if i end up tripping tonight i hope to read about sri ramakrishna in the wee hours of the morning

2022-10-16 at 04:26:11: @allisonwilens 💪🏽🥳

2022-10-16 at 04:13:15: omg i should have worn this specific wrapped stone necklace too, one friend gave me and another friend the two sister necklaces

2022-10-16 at 04:06:45: forgot to wear my lucky turtle ring! alas

2022-10-16 at 00:04:07: i’m hopeful there will be wholesome, deep, connective conversations; peaceful morning moments in the forest - that the air is crisp and laden with scent; good music on loud speakers; and pleasant memories formed with friends new and old

2022-10-16 at 00:00:44: tonight a friend and i are driving down the coast a little ways to party with our french friend and his polycule..... chaos awaits

2022-10-15 at 21:41:12: making a pretty grocery list definitely helped https://t.co/VdB1Xf4Co7

2022-10-15 at 21:39:03: @hormeze @embryosophy !!!

2022-10-15 at 21:38:35: yay for getting my weekend groceries done today!

2022-10-15 at 20:45:11: just got to local indian store for a few groceries; the scent, sights, and people speaking hindi in the background coalesce to create a deep feeling of comfort in me. i’m almost crying!

2022-10-15 at 17:57:10: before i had a morning routine, i had no way of transforming or channeling the emotional state i woke up in

2022-10-15 at 17:49:57: tis the season for nasya (oiling your nostrils)

2022-10-15 at 04:39:15: @altsanabo chill night in! just ironed a favorite nightgown ... simple pleasures. about to make a late night snack

2022-10-15 at 04:13:06: @goblinodds awww boo migraine. that sounds like a fun evening! i just took a lovely shower and will make some food next. then hopefully a call with bf!

2022-10-15 at 04:11:35: @zencephalon yayy sounds cozy

2022-10-15 at 03:57:33: hi friday night twitter who’s up n what are you up to

2022-10-14 at 22:09:48: note to self: you can open up to your advisor about the internal process of doing the work - he often has useful advice not just about the science, but about the psychology too!

2022-10-14 at 18:51:15: RT @lilaexpt: tell me about ur fav ways to un-contract ur awareness. or what was that instrumental domino that fell in your experience/ego…

2022-10-14 at 16:54:28: just gotta hit that switch, from:

i don’t know anything, it’s daunting to get started digging into the scientific literature ➡️ my mind is meant for assimilating information, i love swimming in the tides of knowledge, surfing on a specific wave

2022-10-14 at 16:48:53: @eIfcup 💕😊

2022-10-14 at 16:00:49: long commute schedule optimization pondering: hm maybe i will switch from

4 days/week (m-t-th-fri) commuting (1h15 each way), full work days

to

5 days/week commuting, allowing half days two days out of the week

2022-10-14 at 15:54:25: somehow only this week is the summer-to-fall transition really hitting me. and not in a good way! it’s quite disarming

2022-10-14 at 15:37:22: tell me about ur fav ways to un-contract ur awareness. or what was that instrumental domino that fell in your experience/ego and expanded ur awareness by some notable amount 🙂

2022-10-14 at 15:33:38: i hope to be increasingly able to un-contract my awareness without the help of cannabis

2022-10-14 at 15:32:05: one thing cannabis helps me do is un-contract my awareness. thoughts are freer to arise and float through my stream of awareness, rather than become further entangled in the web of ego-thoughts

2022-10-13 at 23:52:18: gonna go hang &amp; help a friend harvest stuff from his garden, then a run, and hopefully a call with bf too. i think all this will be good for morale! i’m feeling a little bit demoralized about work

2022-10-13 at 23:10:03: @er1enney0ung made my day, thank you éri 🤍

2022-10-13 at 23:08:54: @liekovarpio i feel this way after a year in my science phd program :’) so nice to be able to be tender and curious and witness others’ tenderness and curiosity

2022-10-13 at 21:19:03: feeling frustrated by a number of things, it’s a static-y buzzing in my head and neck, trying now to walk it off

2022-10-13 at 19:57:44: @allgarbled @BecomingCritter yea i was gonna say protractor on my screen

2022-10-13 at 17:10:17: @yogacid @alex_here_now @erik_davis sick i’m interested in reading both!

2022-10-13 at 16:38:54: as of late when i close my eyes and take a few deep breaths i can feel my mind swirl around me

2022-10-13 at 05:22:56: @bit_christ @prerationalist 👀 is this true in your experience?

2022-10-13 at 00:36:35: luv asking people for their running routes and then trying them &amp; reporting back. makes me feel closer to them

2022-10-12 at 00:41:41: refuse to get tiktok so i replace it with ig reels - here is my favorite reel ever https://t.co/xQxnbwwZ5b

2022-10-11 at 17:18:11: i owe it to myself to finish writing this, to immortalize an utterly transformative period of life

2022-10-11 at 17:16:53: yup. it’s gotta be my piece on the first year of my phd. i have a draft from months ago that’s maybe 2/3 done, looked at it this morning for the first time in months and was deeply moved by the beauty and truth of my words - the way my mind poured onto the page

2022-10-10 at 05:44:30: roasted fall veggies (red &amp; golden beets, yams, japanese sweet potato, carrot) with ghee, rosemary, fennel seed, and salt https://t.co/bKAcdA6Txs

2022-10-10 at 02:29:41: was just making my bed and had a moment of identification: the way we light diyas on diwali to welcome lakshmi into our homes - i’m making my bed for me, that divine spark within me, to make her feel clear-minded and safe when it is time to sleep

2022-10-10 at 00:58:25: as always there are different angles. the thoughts are god too. you can meditate and practice revering each thought as a manifestation of shakti

2022-10-10 at 00:54:12: moments without thought are like the spaces in between your breaths. both are god

2022-10-10 at 00:51:57: flow states are experiences of union with god

2022-10-09 at 22:40:12: also, grocery shopping when you’re not in the rhythm of cooking - go easy on yourself! start with simple things you know how to make. you can add in an exciting new dish next week

2022-10-09 at 21:20:05: have to remind myself of this before i go grocery shopping bc i can get anxious and demoralized trying to decide on the week’s meals

2022-10-09 at 21:18:55: the food you make doesn’t have to be complicated or fancy to be good! simple food can be deeply nourishing

2022-10-09 at 21:02:58: perhaps a good first knitting project for me would be a yellow &amp; blue striped scarf for my dad

2022-10-09 at 20:06:19: @eIfcup i also like how my gums feel after! haha

2022-10-09 at 19:48:52: @eIfcup u still oil pulling? i’ve been enjoying it recently

2022-10-09 at 19:48:26: it’s interesting how creative endeavors arise. sometimes you need to hold a loose vision in your mind, hold it gently - not too tightly! - and trust it will come back to you if it is meant to be. hold that loose vision and let the salient notes from your experiences populate it

2022-10-09 at 19:45:28: maybe you’re avoiding that task because it’s too ambitious - be with the avoidance and it will tell you this. make the task smaller - just getting started on the thing, just setting a 20 min timer and doing what you can in that time

2022-10-09 at 19:43:48: an assumption i used to make with to-do lists is that it’s trivial to transition between tasks you’ve laid out for yourself. sometimes it is! sometimes it isn’t, and you have to give yourself the care you need in between

2022-10-09 at 02:26:07: think i’m on a gradual ascent to my peak fitness level ever in life. bone density goin up, cardiovascular system getting stronger, aerobic capacity increasing, mitochondria multiplying

2022-10-08 at 23:15:21: what a wonderful chaotic set of shared experiences in a beautiful, almost mystical place. new friends were made &amp; friendships were deepened!

2022-10-08 at 21:40:30: every time i taste that deep steadiness within, i long to live my life in a deep way

2022-10-08 at 21:37:00: when i’m tripping i often feel as though i almost can’t bear the emotions &amp; sensations i’m feeling; they’re almost overwhelming, i’m teetering on a precipice, can’t tell if i’m enjoying myself or in discomfort (probably both, but i wouldn’t know)

2022-10-08 at 20:52:00: @Lan_Dao_ near monterey :)

2022-10-08 at 03:45:07: @relic_radiation @smallkewlhuman @ElijahBallingxr somehow reminds me of goldmund from herman hesse’s book “narcissus and goldmund”

2022-10-08 at 02:48:35: RT @_StevenFan: Peers in agency. In navigating possible worlds. In seeing subtle causality. Moving in flow. And remarking on it with poetic…

2022-10-08 at 02:48:01: @_StevenFan yesss well said!

2022-10-06 at 17:00:12: heading off to phd program’s departmental retreat today! time to meet the new students and get up to no good with my friends

2022-10-06 at 16:29:32: @self_beware @relic_radiation oho wow this made those concepts make sense

2022-10-05 at 20:42:54: RT @wholebodyprayer: People behave better when they feel loved

2022-10-05 at 19:23:52: allowing myself to just enjoy my lighter than usual workload this week, without clinging to it, without clinging to anxiety about next week

2022-10-05 at 17:48:28: too good https://t.co/suBZ3gRc8a

2022-10-05 at 06:16:22: life really is all about picking up the projects we start

2022-10-05 at 05:58:55: tonight i picked up a crochet project i last worked on in july ☺️🥳 putting some stitches in before bed now 😌 got an idea of a pretty way to do the collar 🌷

2022-10-05 at 05:39:10: how do you feel about the idea of being reincarnated as a cat in your next life?

2022-10-05 at 02:44:35: holding oneself in kinder regard 🔄 holding others in kinder regard

is a wonderful positive feedback cycle. talk to urself like u would a friend, and in the process learn new ways of talking to others. &amp; vice versa

2022-10-05 at 01:11:06: i had an excellent meeting with my advisor today! 🙌🏽 

he praised a few of the actions i had taken since our last meeting, and confirmed that i’m making progress &amp; that my “questions are getting sharper”

2022-10-05 at 01:08:23: @RichardBono7 say more?

2022-10-05 at 01:05:40: probably one of the first such interactions i’ve had with my mother. it was so sweet! i’m so glad she sought me out &amp; i got to be there for her. aww we both be growing up &amp; both be healing 💗

2022-10-05 at 01:04:26: mom called me for reassurance on a course of action she was taking &amp; not sure about... and i got to reflect the situation back to her and support her &amp; she said my words made her feel better!

2022-10-04 at 19:25:23: there are no absolutes, and yet we continue to seek them. all we can do is learn to listen to our hearts &amp; enjoy the lifelong process of getting to know ourselves

2022-10-04 at 19:01:29: oh that silly thought pattern that entreats you to give up on things when they don’t immediately feel good

2022-10-04 at 18:26:43: @soundrotator vv helpful reminder for me too!

2022-10-04 at 18:24:30: in the guided meditation portion of the class, continuity was described as continuous awareness/attention between breaths. this made sense to me, even if i couldn’t sustain it for long

2022-10-04 at 18:23:12: went to a meditation class last week &amp; learned that three pillars of shamatha, or calm abiding, are relaxation, continuity, and clarity/luminosity. my thoughts keep returning to these pillars, and guide me to ask: how can i support continuity in my daily life?

2022-10-04 at 03:15:01: you are strange just as i am strange and i love you

2022-10-04 at 02:34:42: @poIypore truly! discovered him through canadian bf

2022-10-04 at 02:30:36: newly discovering &amp; appreciating this caribou album https://t.co/M6LUnjFJl5

2022-10-04 at 01:35:45: makes me wanna get around to reading @neuralkn0t’s thesis on interpersonal coherence...

2022-10-04 at 01:32:12: i started to notice “interpersonal ego” after this - the creation, persistence, and dissolution of thoughts held between two people &amp; effects on relationship dynamics https://t.co/zHTWdUR43u

2022-10-03 at 20:44:31: starting to track my spending, yesterday i calculated my breakdown for the month of september: 59% fixed costs, 14% investments, 17% spending, 11% savings

2022-10-03 at 19:43:46: how 2 reconcile reverence for life force in all forms - other humans, animals, plants, everything - with an ant problem in your kitchen? surely each ant contains life, but i feel compelled to end their lives

2022-10-03 at 19:41:45: in the mood to watch a documentary about jainism

2022-10-03 at 06:54:46: the way the moon looks bigger when it’s near the horizon is one of my favorite things about living on earth

2022-10-03 at 06:54:08: just watched moonset over the hills in the distance at bf’s place in LA and it was spectacular. orange slice of moon sank slowly and sped up and pulsed orange and white as it crossed the hills

2022-09-30 at 22:56:28: @FractalAuth sending love through the aether! just a day or two ago the thought arose to prepare a ~mushroom experience centered on self-acceptance

2022-09-30 at 20:42:48: @yogacid @DhammaService is disclosure of substance use routine before meditation retreats? (it would make sense)

2022-09-30 at 20:09:06: @myceliummage sickkkk! so excited for you

2022-09-30 at 17:39:44: @xsphi @____keh 🤍

2022-09-30 at 17:20:31: thanks friends! i chose (3). definitely worth it!

2022-09-30 at 16:31:38: debating between ways to get to the airport

(1) public transit, get there a few min after boarding starts, anxiety inducing, $6

(2) transit + lyft, get there a little sooner, have to transfer, $14

(3) lyft, get there w time to spare, cognitively easiest, $20

2022-09-30 at 06:22:55: @rhymeswithvocal google calendar + trello for evolving daily to do lists &amp; longer term things

2022-09-30 at 06:20:22: @profeshkitten @tasshinfogleman so good!

2022-09-30 at 04:04:33: had a beautiful evening run, 3mi, running towards the berkeley hills with houses lit up against the darkening sky, smells of campfire and floral sweetness in the air

2022-09-30 at 01:37:16: strange spaceyness descended upon me about an hour ago. it’s not unpleasant. my head feels empty. i can read words but nothing sticks

2022-09-29 at 05:24:25: @finlesswonder awwww just skimming but i already love this. wowww. you know what else i like to read? the acknowledgments sections of phd theses. similar vibe, reflecting on those that have impacted you

2022-09-29 at 05:21:53: @finlesswonder i started reading meditations two years ago but don’t recall that chapter - let me take a look! 🤍

2022-09-29 at 05:20:42: 🤍 https://t.co/9QdhjJLiKm

2022-09-29 at 05:10:40: how did you make contact with the divinity within today?

2022-09-29 at 02:47:36: @profeshkitten still in progress - fried quinoa, japanese sweet potato fries, and hummus!

2022-09-29 at 02:12:29: the last time i had a dinner that deeply satiated me, at a physical level &amp; at a soul level, was saturday night. on track for another such dinner tonight!

2022-09-29 at 02:10:51: something friends have repeatedly told me is that i am uniquely willing to initiate difficult conversations

2022-09-28 at 23:51:15: @taalumot on a recent visit i got not one, not two, but three injections of a local anesthetic into my gums and my body was straight up vibrating in the dentist's chair

2022-09-28 at 23:19:34: started a proper financial tracking spreadsheet and i’m so excited to gain more info on myself &amp; adapt the system to my needs!

2022-09-28 at 20:04:25: this is something my phd has been helping me cultivate. in order to progress scientifically, you have to be honest with where your understanding is! you cannot posture! and there’s no need to, ideally your earnest curiosity is all that’s needed https://t.co/GAsrcTtJZB

2022-09-28 at 19:11:19: @tapir_worf dude it’s so good. really opened my eyes, really well done, generally captivating. i like that they allow for some silence in between people talking, makes for a slow start but lets things sink in later on

https://t.co/cTv0Uz1v7p

2022-09-28 at 18:52:54: @tapir_worf have you listened to cover story?!

2022-09-28 at 18:43:38: the more u think about a decision the more of your life force energy you put into it. some decisions do in fact require more energy; but many day to day decisions can be made with less obsession, less anxiety, &amp; less rumination

2022-09-28 at 17:11:32: i’m tired of contracting and tensing when i have a thought i think i shouldn’t have

2022-09-28 at 17:10:25: omg i just remembered i can exercise and this will improve things at least a little

2022-09-28 at 17:08:42: i just want that quietness n flow n lack of self criticism n releasing thoughts sometimes effortlessly to come back...

2022-09-28 at 17:07:22: could traveling for four out of the five weekends this month have something to do with it? ahaha

2022-09-28 at 17:06:07: my mind has been noticeably more restless for the past ~week. stark contrast to the quietness &amp; flow i was experiencing in august. it will be interesting to observe how the restlessness resolves itself!

2022-09-27 at 18:05:47: @grantbels hahaha that’s a creative interpretation. i was being extremely literal. basically i’ve been struggling to take this medicine at a consistent time... and i remembered tasshin tweeting once that if u wanted to do something, writing down your commitment / intention could help

2022-09-26 at 22:43:34: @grantbels noted, your encouragement is much appreciated!

2022-09-26 at 20:24:44: systems are how we unify our thinking

2022-09-26 at 19:57:22: @wayfaring_tim @visakanv so lovely - your voice, the music, both the more mundane moments and the grand scenery

2022-09-26 at 19:17:48: there’s a medicine i have to take daily, and if i vary the time of consumption too much, i’m in pain as early as the next day. i commit to taking this medicine at the same time of day each day (10pm)

2022-09-26 at 18:43:28: he be a sattvic cat for sure

2022-09-26 at 18:43:06: thinking of going to sleep early enough that i can just wake up when my cat wakes up and scratches at my bedroom door to be let out at 5:40am

2022-09-26 at 17:58:35: @alth0u althou this SLAPS 🤍

2022-09-26 at 17:57:50: i can feel my heart almost ready to commit to completing &amp; refining my next piece of writing

2022-09-26 at 06:30:02: IRL likely in east bay; donation based; would be nice if people came to multiple sessions to foster a sense of familiarity / nurture nascent connections, but not mandatory for a person to come for all 6; perhaps a special event to mark the conclusion of this pilot

2022-09-26 at 06:27:22: current thinking: pilot of 6 sessions, capped at 6-8 people each, 2x/month, dinner provided. each session has a question/central concept relevant to spirituality/spiritual practice; sharing and discussion will be facilitated https://t.co/seOaRGEXU1

2022-09-26 at 06:07:28: @nickcammarata taggin @altsanabo so he sees too ^-^

2022-09-26 at 06:07:03: @nickcammarata just remembered, bf loooves this stuff. 2.5% abv. tart but smooth, sweeter than beer, all around lovely &amp; perhaps ideal for your use case! can find in beers section of trader joe’s &amp; some bars https://t.co/DyUGYKKhNg

2022-09-26 at 04:35:52: the instructions for emotional processing are spot 👏🏽 on 👏🏽. who knew wikihow could be a resource for learning emotional regulation? https://t.co/13EYA2OZFR

2022-09-26 at 04:29:40: found this talk &amp; its transcript from 2003. loving it! integrates compassion (daya) with other concepts i know - ahimsa, bliss; compassion involves gaining "reverence for all life"

https://t.co/mUdwnAbsen

2022-09-26 at 04:26:21: have been feeling drawn towards cultivation of compassion. 'cultivation of compassion' feels somehow buddhist to me. but surely compassion practices are widespread amongst faiths. diving into hinduism now to find relevant ideas and practices

2022-09-26 at 04:05:21: feels tonight. oh the sweetness of witnessing one another amidst the passage of time https://t.co/jKRq87HGXp

2022-09-25 at 21:15:35: @grantbels out of curiosity, how often do you clean apt / diff parts of apt?

2022-09-25 at 06:40:41: @quotidiania im such a west coast gal 😭

2022-09-25 at 06:35:47: @quotidiania no just visiting!

2022-09-25 at 05:23:45: yuh https://t.co/7a9C3YS5z9

2022-09-25 at 05:01:36: @nomanautomata @nickcammarata i knowww i appreciate the reassurance 🥺🙏🏽

2022-09-25 at 04:56:55: @nomanautomata @nickcammarata maybe the overwhelming ness was a testament to some sort of internal progress 🤷🏽‍♀️

2022-09-25 at 04:55:54: @nomanautomata @nickcammarata my last psychedelic experience was pretty overwhelming... don’t think i’ve ever felt so untethered. not in a rush to repeat

2022-09-25 at 04:54:42: @nomanautomata @nickcammarata i just have such cognitive dissonance bc i feel i’m on a spiritual / meditative path but still a bit of a heavyweight with substances. i guess it reaffirms i have subtler things to tune into...... and then this train of thought sometimes makes me feel bad to enjoy substances

2022-09-25 at 04:49:45: crossing the C ᵒⁿᶜᵒᵘʳˢᵉ https://t.co/zstohc65HN

2022-09-25 at 04:45:07: @nickcammarata i think some people are just baseline more sensitive!

2022-09-25 at 04:42:44: @nickcammarata why do you think so many are so sensitive to substances? is it something like, the more into meditation you are the more sensitive your nervous system gets

2022-09-25 at 04:29:52: dearly, deeply, and completely

2022-09-25 at 03:28:19: gonna get some 1am coffee once i get back to cambridge hehe

2022-09-24 at 23:03:03: does it depend on what negative emotions we are introduced to as children?

2022-09-24 at 23:02:38: what are the first negative emotions we learn to recognize in ourselves, beyond “i feel bad”?

2022-09-24 at 22:29:13: smell felt heaven-sent, god intervening for a moment on this physical plane

2022-09-24 at 22:27:17: i think it being chilly outside is a big factor for the coziness

2022-09-24 at 22:26:34: it smells like palo santo in the orange line downtown crossing station, forest hills bound

2022-09-24 at 22:20:11: so fucking cozy sitting in between two larger strangers on a subway rn... who knew being packed in like sardines could be so cozy...

2022-09-24 at 21:08:39: lol i used to want to intellectually understand how we think with our bodies but i ended up with an embodied wordless understanding instead

2022-09-24 at 20:57:39: heading to the only thrift store i’ll be able to fit into this visit, wish me luck in finding my perfect cambridge sweater

2022-09-24 at 19:25:00: just an hour or so til i get to hang with my college friend who i haven’t seen in yearssss! we met in an anthropology course and one day after class i saw her at the bus stop and knew i had to talk to her

2022-09-24 at 17:43:20: @rhymeswithvocal lightning fast response tho wow

2022-09-24 at 17:42:51: @rhymeswithvocal mmmmf i haven’t set up circle yet bc it feels like another layer of complication in my twitter experience ........ guess it could be nice tho

2022-09-24 at 17:40:52: @rhymeswithvocal wonder what the twitter equivalent of hearthmaxxing is

2022-09-24 at 17:40:01: omg just remembered many of my friends back in the bay are at a certain music festival this weekend doing all sorts of substances... may their journeys be safe, illuminating, and joyous 🌸

2022-09-24 at 17:38:11: @rhymeswithvocal thank u charlie needed this

2022-09-24 at 17:37:54: feel like i’ve been in maintenance / diving deeper into existing twitter friendships mode, considering trying a shift into actively investing in new connections mode

2022-09-24 at 17:36:19: @grantbels yes! it was spectacular! glad you noticed :)

2022-09-24 at 17:02:48: @irafeierabend @relic_radiation first photo somehow feels unnerving; second photo much less so, more evocative and tender to me

2022-09-24 at 15:55:54: yayyyy for invigorating science conversations with friends old and new

2022-09-23 at 05:44:14: god does it feel good to have my land legs back

2022-09-23 at 05:35:07: one last stop before i can get off this train... it’s been a hellish ride with bountiful motion sickness

2022-09-23 at 04:34:16: it’s a packed 2 day trip with a red eye there and a red eye back. lots of social things scheduled, reconnecting with old friends! will be special to see them in person. planning to run on adrenaline, appreciation of novelty, and social energy :’))

2022-09-23 at 04:27:00: i get to see hah vard tomorrow for the first time ever!

2022-09-23 at 04:19:11: my brain cannot reconcile my current reality (9pm after a long day in the bay) with tomorrow morning (+3 hours in a city i haven’t been to since childhood!)

2022-09-23 at 04:17:40: just stepped out of my apartment en route to the airport for a trip to the east coast !

2022-09-23 at 03:21:24: it stands to reason that the thrift shop sweater collection would be more interesting in boston than in berkeley, right....?

2022-09-22 at 18:01:18: my mental waters sure do be agitated today, but it’s nice to be able to observe this rather than just be stuck in it

2022-09-22 at 00:27:49: oh my goodness we’re almost in sunset before 7pm territory

2022-09-21 at 20:44:48: @sweetfernery omg my lab mate was telling me about this book lol. apparently a mole (6e23 ish) of moles (like the animal) is as big as the moon or something like that

2022-09-21 at 20:43:43: this is who i aspire to be for those i love https://t.co/uLD0K8BP8S

2022-09-21 at 20:32:39: gifting is not something that comes naturally to me / my family, so whenever i think of a gift that feels right my heart sings

2022-09-21 at 20:32:14: i think i’m gonna buy my dad a copy of murakami’s book on writing and running. my sense is he’d appreciate murakami’s words on exercise, practice, emotional regulation, and aging

2022-09-21 at 01:52:43: @pratibimbana when my mom started working more with bala mantra she found little girls  would just come up to her for some reason or another :’)

2022-09-21 at 01:46:10: funny thing i’ve observed since leaning into the scientist, curiosity-driven part of my identity is that i cannot stay mad/grumpy at bf if he shows me a compelling paper

2022-09-20 at 19:57:03: i keep remembering that paying attention to eye contact makes life at least 5x more fun

2022-09-20 at 19:52:31: i genuinely feel god guided me to my phd lab. even when things aren’t going well i always return to deep gratitude. for having been led to an environment where i am continually nurtured &amp; encouraged to be myself

2022-09-20 at 19:46:41: as it stands, our best guess for when bf and i will be able to conclude long distance and move in together is next summer. ongoing thread of wistful manifestations let’s go

2022-09-19 at 18:03:58: i feel my interpersonal frustrations often arise when i want someone to be different than they are now. perhaps patience is holding the space for them to change, and for my own expectations to evolve

2022-09-19 at 17:48:14: my advisor is willing to repeat the same explanations, same points to his mentees time and again until they comprehend them. there’s no sign of frustration at having to repeat himself; it’s as if he knows the repetition is necessary

2022-09-19 at 17:46:53: so i’m understanding the value of cultivating patience, in particular interpersonally

2022-09-19 at 00:56:03: good alone time feels like wading into the waters of your inner world, swimming in your tides of mind

2022-09-19 at 00:16:37: my cat perched beside my napping boyfriend, under the comforter https://t.co/23QclIy0wv

2022-09-18 at 21:14:05: finally reading some of meaningness, this is the first time it's caught my interest. but even so, having a hard time fully taking it into my being, perhaps because it is built upon an assertion of atheism

2022-09-18 at 20:25:51: @PrinceVogel this is incredible

2022-09-18 at 03:58:56: 40 min til bf and i are reunited ^-^ i made a nice lil yellow curry for dinner and packed him a serving for when i pick him up from the train station ^-^

2022-09-17 at 17:12:22: @donmexlar true wow well put

2022-09-17 at 02:06:29: @sweetfernery yayy how’s the air?

2022-09-17 at 01:25:23: hahaha the party i was gonna go to is actually next week. thank u universe!!!

2022-09-17 at 01:01:35: i think party would be interesting &amp; i’d have some engaging conversations... but at what cost! 😭 tell me twitter, what do i do?

2022-09-17 at 00:56:41: thought i wanted to go to a party tonight but i’m soooo tempted by the prospect of staying home and having sweet sweet alone time... starting on the thermo textbook i got 2day, reading this sick tantric meditation book i rediscovered, cleaning a new shelf i found...... 😭

2022-09-17 at 00:48:14: @sweetfernery aw sending you love and warmth

2022-09-17 at 00:31:39: my favorite thing about instagram is posting something and randomly getting a comment or reply from an old friend. with a few earnest words they came out of the void and crossed the distance, through time and space, to get to me

2022-09-16 at 02:15:22: walking from one bus stop to another downtown, made momentary eye contact with a blonde guy with blue eyes, not much taller than me, who smiled at me and said “hello!” i smiled and he called after me, “have a good night!”

2022-09-16 at 02:12:33: nice way to end a day spent feeling sad: heading over for a one on one hangout with a friend who lives walking distance away. he’ll be feeding me dinner too!

2022-09-15 at 21:35:24: feel like i need a list of friends who i can just call (in part so that it doesn’t feel like the end of the world when bf isn’t available)

2022-09-15 at 21:16:12: @_holyweather good question!

2022-09-15 at 20:53:46: @mathonwy @ActualAll10 somehow it never occurred to me that people could be lying about their heights

2022-09-15 at 18:31:40: alrighty i’m fairly certain i’ve got some hormonal bs going on that’s making me more emotional

2022-09-15 at 16:30:07: and now i’m crying at the dentist. strong start

2022-09-15 at 15:59:54: ah yes... rumination about my relationship... my favorite way to start the day 😪

2022-09-15 at 05:51:38: strongly considering getting an ava bracelet for cycle tracking. it’s marketed to women trying to conceive but i think even women not in that stage of life could benefit from awareness of their cycles

2022-09-15 at 00:13:33: @gracemercur not a bad idea, curious what’s drawing you to computer science?

2022-09-15 at 00:06:11: just absurd how much better i felt after meditating today. did a guided meditation which at one point leads you to feeling the presence of the holy mother in your heart, and i swear afterward i felt her presence in my body

2022-09-14 at 06:14:09: @christineist lookin fwd to intersecting w you in LA!

2022-09-14 at 02:51:47: or, alternatively, take steadying breaths and otherwise regulate my nervous system / body tension load

2022-09-14 at 02:48:26: and often all i need to feel at least a little better in moments of constriction, is the ability to release or pacify my ego

2022-09-14 at 02:47:29: can’t stop thinking about this tweet! wild to realize my general happiness has been tightly correlated to the expansiveness of my awareness &amp; extent of self knowledge https://t.co/sucFgUR87U

2022-09-13 at 15:25:23: update i absolutely killed the talk last night

2022-09-13 at 05:18:39: omwww to hot springs! first time ever experiencing them

2022-09-12 at 18:49:56: @christineist surreal to see tidbits of my writing highlighted and shared 💗 thank you christine :)

2022-09-12 at 07:06:26: i want to be sympathetic / charitable but her vibe is kinda dragging my vibe down

2022-09-12 at 07:05:50: lab mate and i both have presentations to prepare for tomorrow and her vibe is kinda anxious and overthinking everything and i just don’t want to engage

i’m tryna make &amp; refine my presentation out of the deep love i have for my work &amp; for good communication

2022-09-12 at 03:43:58: this afternoon a small group of us took the trolley to a lake and my lab mate gave me a swimming lesson amidst the mountainous scenery https://t.co/p7CzNNmVLl

2022-09-11 at 04:17:50: @gracemercur maybe u can reconfigure ur desires to be in alignment? or are desires immutable?

2022-09-10 at 17:10:17: @donmexlar hope u get to drink a nice beverage or consume a delectable pastry too

2022-09-10 at 15:44:38: @pratibimbana sunset bedtimes in the winter too? like 4:30/5pm?

2022-09-08 at 22:28:06: @grantbels dude i think i saw the headline when that came out, and immediately went out and bought 20:1 cbd edibles without doing any further reading. do you happen to know what the real deal is?

2022-09-08 at 22:26:35: @grantbels hahaha amazing. i’m just starting my journey with wearables, mainly for heart rate monitoring while exercising for now. what’s small dose for you &amp; is there a specific strain type/blend? (eg 1:1 thc cbd, sativa, indica, etc)

2022-09-08 at 22:16:57: @grantbels lol at “small doses of edibles are fine” - u kno i value that info haha

2022-09-08 at 22:15:06: @grantbels thank you for your input - much appreciated!

2022-09-08 at 21:32:24: i’ll probs also avoid alcohol &amp; cannabis bc i have some vague sense they’re immunosuppressants

2022-09-08 at 21:31:57: there’s a balance to be struck here between accepting whatever unfolds &amp; attempting to be proactive

2022-09-08 at 21:25:18: so let’s say i had a covid exposure last night &amp; i am quite keen on not getting it... what can i do to support my immune system? 

will take any and all suggestions - i’ve got echinacea extract, will have some raw garlic as per mom’s traditional remedy, get sleep, exercise...

2022-09-08 at 06:55:18: @christineist christine u are inspiring me to start hosting the events i want to see in the world! https://t.co/seOaRGnUS1

2022-09-08 at 04:09:12: craving expansion!!

2022-09-08 at 01:01:15: i’m working on an essay abt how i became aware of the connection between mind and body: how emotions manifest as physical sensations. a couple psychosomatic illnesses/ailments convinced me

curious how others came to be aware of mind-body connection; has anyone always known?

2022-09-07 at 03:07:41: stating to feel a little divergence between psychedelics &amp; my path

2022-09-07 at 03:06:51: love the process of guiding my body back to homeostasis

2022-09-07 at 03:04:30: really want to sew a two piece top/pants set, same pastel fabric; pants that cinch the waist but are a little wide in the legs, and a simple tank top with a simple neckline

2022-09-07 at 02:56:56: asked 5 and a half friends if they were down to hang tonight and finally found one who’s free. feelin like the littl train that could lmao

2022-09-07 at 02:42:25: where does your strength come from?

2022-09-03 at 19:04:22: i never believed in the power of hats until a 4-ho-met trip in late 2021. my friend emily hat-pilled me. i put one on in their chilly home with no heating and felt noticeably warmer in a minute or less

2022-09-03 at 05:36:53: @eIfcup yes u can re-up reliably up to 1h in!

2022-09-01 at 06:37:19: @spenceraviav yep! this has become much clearer to me in the past few months. fortunately once you realize this you can find ways to slip out of ego / manage ego &amp; stop getting in your own way so dang much

2022-09-01 at 05:07:41: on a walk home from picking up a hat, i crossed the street at the exact moment my monk friend was leaving on bike from a friend’s house, and we ran into each other! 

had i left my house at a different moment or had he departed at a different time this would not have happened...

2022-09-01 at 05:06:12: every time i run into someone serendipitously i marvel at the workings of the divine

2022-08-31 at 19:34:52: i hit one year with one friend on may 1st and every time i think of her i am grateful for her presence in my life

2022-08-31 at 19:34:06: i've been living in the bay for a little over two years and i'm hitting milestones of knowing friends for one year; in december i hit two years with a dear friend. i love burrowing into these relationships. they keep getting better with time!

2022-08-31 at 19:28:50: have any of you done mescaline? curious what your experience(s) was like. feel free to dm ☀️

2022-08-31 at 19:18:07: @altsanabo thank u for validation 🙏🏽

2022-08-31 at 19:17:47: @tasshinfogleman @altsanabo @christineist oh wow good to know! :)

2022-08-31 at 17:55:11: my most direct experiences of God these days are when I pray. the warm, loving, peaceful energy that builds in my chest (my heart) is an experience of God

2022-08-31 at 17:50:14: i feel like God usually reveals themself to me in the creases of everyday life. where in the living of every day life we weave a fabric, and God appears in moments that feel like folds of the fabric

2022-08-31 at 17:22:43: @christineist summoning @altsanabo too haha

2022-08-31 at 17:22:28: @christineist so i suppose i’ll just feel some discomfort about misalignment of the aesthetic i want (minimalist site) and the current aesthetic (substack). and at some point the discomfort will cross a threshold and then i’ll act?

lol basically does this sound reasonable or what would u do

2022-08-31 at 17:20:39: @christineist but i don’t have the know-how to spin one up quickly. (realizing some of my avoidance comes from a domain i have but which i don’t love aesthetically) ,,, so my plan has been to get in the flow of publishing stuff using substack and at some point migrate to/add personal site

2022-08-31 at 17:18:53: @christineist a request for thoughts: i have some writing that’s very close to being released, been working on it for the past month. my plan has been to release it on substack (already have one, it seems the easiest) but aesthetically i like the idea of a minimalist personal site...

2022-08-31 at 17:16:21: @christineist love! thanks u guys

2022-08-31 at 17:11:40: my poor homebody heart

2022-08-29 at 01:30:16: who knew preparing food for tonight and tomorrow would be the highlight of my weekend ☺️ having such a good time cooking!

2022-08-29 at 01:23:44: is there anything you can eat or drink to help stabilize blood sugar after ingesting too much sugar? my sugar threshold seems 2 be going down

2022-08-29 at 01:14:24: apparently the same is true of quinoa! alrighty, i’m cooking 1 cup dry chickpeas &amp; 1 cup quinoa now, let’s see how many meals they last me...

2022-08-29 at 01:10:52: google tells me my 1 cup of dried chickpeas will yield 3 cups when cooked. somehow i’m doubtful of a tripling in size, but we’ll find out in approx 1 hour

2022-08-27 at 21:48:01: @nowtheo i feel pretty good about that! i’d do well to remember it. resonates with other recent feelings of life being sacred in its every manifestation; and with my belief of inherent goodness/divinity

2022-08-27 at 21:34:08: currently living out “once you’re able to identify ego and experience being without it, how do you get yourself to do anything?”

2022-08-25 at 21:53:18: @smiling_for_fun didn’t get a notif for this 😤 what a lovely tidbit! thanks for sharing

2022-08-24 at 20:36:39: @infinitsummer when u feel disconnected then you become attentive to connection

2022-08-24 at 20:36:04: @infinitsummer yes!

2022-08-24 at 18:51:34: i’ve become much better at minimizing and mitigating my self-inflicted negative emotions, but i have no clear protocol on what to do when negative emotions arise from an interaction with someone else. anybody got resources/ideas?

2022-08-24 at 18:48:33: planning a roadtrip from the bay to santa fe for sometime in the next 8 months. i was getting hype about maybe october or early november, but honestly it might be too much of a hit to my momentum at work. so, spring it is i guess!

2022-08-24 at 18:45:32: @sweetfernery oh my goodness. sorry to hear this happened, glad you’re moving towards clarity

2022-08-24 at 18:24:27: you forsake part of your ego in exchange for keeping in connection. anything that gives us a foothold outside of the ego’s web of thought is a taste of what true, divine joy is

2022-08-24 at 18:22:59: because staying in connection keeps connection as the object of concentration

2022-08-24 at 18:21:49: as much as i don’t jive with contact improv, i have to admit they’re on to something with the “you always have to stay in connection” idea. bringing attention to staying in connection is such an interesting experience

2022-08-24 at 18:18:20: perhaps the dosha that is dominating at the time of my high experience determines / subtly affects the nature of the experience

2022-08-24 at 18:17:26: coincidently my cannabis experiences tend to be around that length from beginning to end, real end, when i’m back to ground state reality

2022-08-24 at 18:16:29: apparently different doshas dominate throughout the day, for 4 hour periods - kapha 6-10, pitta 12-2, vata 2-6

2022-08-24 at 01:22:30: just earnest-poasted in a put-together way on my realname acct and i have no idea how ppl are going to interact with it, if at all, but i stand by my tweets!

2022-08-24 at 00:40:31: i know how validating and nourishing it felt to read a spiritual book targeted to me (a woman). feeling the absence of that, if only i wasn’t hung up on it

2022-08-24 at 00:26:26: (3) his whole way of being, as documented in the gospel, is an affront to the rational mind. he is a wellspring from which spiritual truths flow. lots of what he says reminds me of koans - impossible to comprehend thru conventional rational / logical means

2022-08-24 at 00:24:00: frustrating cuz so much of it resonates - eg (1) he tells a disciple to stop instructing others on how to seek god and to instead pursue personally knowing God, (2) he says prayer, spirituality best done with a heart that longs for god - &amp; i know that longing now better than ever

2022-08-24 at 00:20:54: there’s a whole footnote a few pages in which takes the better part of a page to state that sri ramakrishna did not dislike women!

2022-08-24 at 00:17:20: rly digging the messages/ideas in gospel of sri ramakrishna but a little bothered by mental gymnastics to re-interpret his admonitions against ‘woman’ (which i know to mean more generally sexual urges / carnality)

2022-08-23 at 22:21:41: it was fine we just talked about running and his upcoming backpacking trip lol

2022-08-23 at 19:07:07: acute nervous system dysregulation today is affecting my motor skills / hand eye coordination

2022-08-23 at 03:49:55: lately i’ve been able to direct my actions / unify my parts with the collective goal of creating conditions for a calm mind

2022-08-23 at 03:47:10: well would you look at that i’m well and properly stoned

2022-08-22 at 22:53:55: oh i am just itching to start a new crochet project! it’s been a month or so of not crocheting. really captured by this granny square vest pattern here - what colors do you think could be good together? https://t.co/LlDNaIz7Gr

2022-08-22 at 22:41:09: @yokaihainen godspeed sweet hark

2022-08-22 at 16:59:36: actually the mysticism is a key ingredient hehe. so fun to learn about the variety and nature of mystical experiences - a potential map for the territory of spiritual exploration. also lets me appreciate my own mystical experiences in life thus far

2022-08-22 at 16:47:41: thought i wasn’t interested in history. turns out i needed to find the type of history that captured my attention &amp; sense of wonder - recently, i’ve been gripped by indian history with a touch of mysticism, particularly but not exclusively about women spiritual figures

2022-08-22 at 16:36:00: recently learned the lore of mirabai of the 16th century and feeling a draw to learn more about her. perhaps one way to learn is to try taking her image as my own, at least for a bit

2022-08-22 at 16:26:14: ohhhh btw i’m feeling a profile pic change coming on. just wanted to warn you guys

2022-08-22 at 16:25:47: something i’ve been feeling for the past few weeks is this sense of leaning into my inherent loveliness. i lean into it and feel my heart and experience and way of becoming, become sweeter

2022-08-22 at 16:14:18: this techno tune often plays itself in my head

2022-08-22 at 14:27:59: heading back home to the west coast, mom sent me off with a sindoor mark of the goddess, tuberosa flowers pinned in my hair, and three juhi jasmine flowers in my palm. heart full

2022-08-22 at 04:20:57: i’m currently working on some paperwork so school classifies me as a california resident... paperwork i’ve been avoiding for months. let a girl be sentimental as she pulls together her supporting documentation !

2022-08-22 at 04:18:33: at the time it was a crazy crazy thing for me to do and yet it felt like the only thing i could do. now it all makes sense. it was, as all things are, divinely ordained

2022-08-22 at 04:15:15: throwback to when i moved across the country on a week’s notice. good times

2022-08-21 at 17:26:17: mom reminded me today of the existence of jahnavi harrison - man is her voice sublime!

2022-08-20 at 23:16:59: @wholebodyprayer wow massive resonance with a recent conversation i had with ayurvedic practitioner in connecticut - he said meditation is not an action but rather a result [eg of a practice / behavior]

2022-08-20 at 21:08:49: visited local vedanta center today and had a wonderful time with a few deeply serendipitous moments. from this visit it became apparent to me that seeking initiation into a hindu sub-tradition is something i should consider more seriously

2022-08-19 at 14:17:02: @BenRatkaj enjoy the ride! :’)

2022-08-19 at 14:15:29: @willlowthewhisp 🥺🤍

2022-08-18 at 14:02:09: @pratibimbana grateful to have crossed paths with you!

2022-08-18 at 13:11:58: amtrakking thru the great state of new jersey as we speak

2022-08-18 at 04:32:48: experienced a summer thunderstorm this evening for the first time in forever. the sky darkened, the wind picked up, the torrential downpour began, and it was over in 40 minutes. afterward we went to the park and i couldn’t stop looking at the sky’s underbelly of clouds

2022-08-18 at 04:30:58: take me back to muir woods with my love!

2022-08-17 at 03:41:55: @wholebodyprayer good question. i lean towards it being a hidden universal urge but i am not sure

2022-08-16 at 22:36:43: apparently there is an indian adaptation of forrest gump that just came out a few days ago?

2022-08-16 at 12:41:58: on the first flight i challenged myself to read the first 20 pages of glass bead game; trying for another 20 on this next flight

2022-08-16 at 06:07:27: @br___ian u do have that many lifetimes tho

2022-08-16 at 04:49:49: yes the edible has started to hit and yes i am a page into a handwritten letter to my little brother (to be continued once i get my meal from mcdonalds, a rare treat and one of the few establishments open at this hour)

2022-08-16 at 04:40:48: get ready for delirious layover matilda. 11pm to 7am in denver baby

2022-08-16 at 04:35:48: i finally overcame this hurdle! my heart and mind melted together on to the page. bf is in for a treat 🥰 https://t.co/WA5VHA5DEw

2022-08-16 at 04:33:57: part of my cultivation practice is reading murakami bc he embeds who he is &amp; things i wish to cultivate in his writing. eg, the practice of letter writing! 

i just felt some wonderful letter writing flow, i’ve been wanting to experience this for a while, and here we are!

2022-08-15 at 17:33:17: spirituality helps us out a great deal. it gives us maxims &amp; beliefs that are eternal, which hold in the tide of transient thoughts

2022-08-15 at 17:31:43: this is what ram dass was talking about in ch 1 of paths to god. it’s difficult to release attachment &amp; to stay in a heart-place where you continually release attachment

2022-08-15 at 17:29:05: it is so helpful to feel less attached to thoughts as they arise; your free flowing mind can build upon itself and figure things out

2022-08-15 at 17:07:14: @flybottlemist i had no idea!

2022-08-15 at 04:46:30: just had fresh figs for the first time!

2022-08-13 at 19:48:30: @asbelcas this is insane!

2022-08-13 at 19:47:51: @asbelcas my goodness you have tremendous luck!

2022-08-13 at 19:46:20: initially i was convinced i had to get ddj400 but i might just get one of those ~$90-100 dollar things with mini turntables. i just wanna make fun mixes &amp; have a reason to listen closely to music &amp; dance

2022-08-13 at 19:45:08: yeah okay i might actually make it a goal to acquire some sort of dj equipment by the end of this month

2022-08-13 at 19:43:26: terrifying moment - almost put coriander into my cacao instead of cinnamon

2022-08-13 at 19:34:33: in order to enjoy alone time you have to feel that you exist even when you’re not around other people

2022-08-12 at 18:01:03: i wanna smell like sandalwood cinnamon and ginger

2022-08-12 at 17:55:31: @altsanabo abt to head into sf will report if weather is as nice in the city!

2022-08-11 at 17:06:19: @tasshinfogleman what are the different ways to build a personal website? i get stuck on: should i start with a google domain, another service, do i use templates or learn some CSS Javascript etc to build it more closely to my aesthetics

2022-08-11 at 16:49:35: the more you question your mind the less clear it becomes how to act

2022-08-11 at 09:03:45: @embryosophy hey buddhi &lt;3 keepin u guys in my prayers

2022-08-11 at 01:21:26: @myceliummage i am not sure i can ask

2022-08-11 at 01:02:15: @myceliummage her take on adderall: “it’s good until it isn’t”

2022-08-11 at 01:01:57: @myceliummage my friend quit cold turkey after some scary nosebleeds &amp; a panic attack

2022-08-10 at 21:29:35: i &lt;3 my wfh wednesdays

2022-08-10 at 21:20:18: that local anesthetic tho... that shit makes me loopy. wild to feel my body shaking in the dentist’s chair under the anesthetic body load

2022-08-10 at 21:19:38: root canal done this morn! wasn’t too bad. ironically i feel better about my dental health now than ever before in my life. i got dis shit under control. hopefully no more root canals!

2022-08-10 at 05:08:55: @nikitanomo do the bare minimum night time routine! brush n floss at the very least

2022-08-10 at 02:03:57: @alex_here_now aw sending love alex, you will find your way back before you know it 💛

2022-08-10 at 02:01:24: @nickcammarata @MasterTimBlais as per this tweet why does unclenching lead to lower res / “worse experience”? i’d assume that if you unclench the tension that is the ego it would make for a better experience? (not disagreeing, just clarifying) https://t.co/2Xf4mxp0yx

2022-08-10 at 01:55:05: @nickcammarata @MasterTimBlais tho i would say my ego is still around most of the time &amp; i am learning so much from handling little affronts to my ego. maybe stream entry is a stage that’s a little further along, when ego is even more quiet?

2022-08-10 at 01:53:35: @nickcammarata @MasterTimBlais oh i guess i should clarify i mean capital s Self as something like IFS Self / the higher divine Self within each person

2022-08-10 at 01:52:14: @nickcammarata @MasterTimBlais “un/clench” isn’t quite my experience but i think it maps onto this feeling i’ve had of Self rising from the ocean of consciousness that is my mind. Self has resolved ego tangles easily - tells them to dissolve back into the ocean &amp; they just do

2022-08-10 at 01:45:09: @nickcammarata @MasterTimBlais wowow ok i didn’t realize that this was stream entry. excited i’m finally coming upon it (interacting with my ego in this way) in my experience

2022-08-10 at 01:42:43: @sunofdopamine thank u for writing out these examples 🙂

2022-08-10 at 01:40:16: @sunofdopamine that makes sense! how does one go about surfacing these parts? what are clues to look out for?

2022-08-10 at 01:38:56: just got home from work and there’s a peaceful, loving feeling in my chest

2022-08-10 at 00:52:20: @sunofdopamine how interesting! my first response is “i don’t think i’m afraid to get things i really want”... does the book (or you) have examples of ways we get in our own way like that?

2022-08-10 at 00:37:34: the concept of ego didn’t mean much to me until something clicked a few weeks ago. that being said, i now feel comfortable divulging that i have no feeling for what shadow work / my shadow is. what made it click for you?

2022-08-10 at 00:08:50: @carmenleelau reminds me how friggin good my morning oatmeal tastes after a sit

2022-08-09 at 04:04:52: make memories you will cherish 🥰

2022-08-09 at 02:31:58: recalling an early childhood memory of being at the clinic and fighting against the drowsy tide of benadryl

2022-08-09 at 02:29:05: @noampomsky ohhh my gosh 😍

2022-08-08 at 19:13:38: @sweetfernery SEO queen! 👸

2022-08-08 at 18:07:33: if you haven’t had dental nerve pain before let me tell you it is a trip. referred pain, radiating pain, waves of pain

2022-08-08 at 18:06:21: at home today, took a sick day because of some gnarly tooth pain. getting checked out at the dentist this afternoon, hoping for the best, prepared as i can be for the worst

2022-08-06 at 19:47:42: @nickcammarata bf “thinks and feels more clearly under cloudy skies”, ideally ones that are threatening to rain or foggy. i had no idea what that felt like until a week or two ago

2022-08-06 at 19:46:52: @nickcammarata i remember being amazed by this belief. i am mid 70s all the way

2022-08-06 at 02:58:23: imma wear it with my birkenstocks tho

2022-08-06 at 02:54:49: fuck if i can find it and if it feels right when i put it on, i’ll put on my sexiest dress for this airport trip 🙈

2022-08-06 at 02:32:04: @bit_christ no i demand earnest poasts!

2022-08-05 at 23:45:48: less! than! 4! hours! until bf and i reunite!

2022-08-05 at 22:32:43: @moothought amen

2022-08-05 at 19:40:48: @the_wilderless not sure if this is your speed but i’d probably get stoned and do something i enjoy for a few hours

2022-08-05 at 16:40:23: @br___ian mine:
930-1030 commute in
1030-1 prep cells for imaging, squeeze lunch in (getting burrito today!)
1-2 image cells
2-3 meeting w advisor
3-4 cell maintenance work
get home by 6ish
b4 7 stop by cvs, then trader joe’s

2022-08-05 at 03:34:26: @eIfcup where did u buy from? i should get some

2022-08-05 at 03:34:08: @eIfcup yesss i love this trick

2022-08-05 at 02:50:56: @philipggarland haha i should say “a little more empathetic”

2022-08-05 at 02:46:03: a lie from childhood is that synesthesia is binary - ie either you have it or you don’t. i think everyone can have synesthetic moments!

2022-08-05 at 02:41:47: today i am being reminded of how i should reach a little further in my interactions with those i care about, reach to be a little kinder, empathetic, warmer

2022-08-05 at 01:50:55: @nat_sharpe_ (it’s a relevant model system for some of the research i do)

2022-08-05 at 01:49:55: @nat_sharpe_ i &lt;3 dicty too!

2022-08-03 at 05:35:34: @DiamonDie well yes my hope is not to understand rationally

2022-08-03 at 05:17:47: (2) ram dass writes that we can be preservers of love and beauty but that we must also be able to look at the destruction of love and beauty and say “yeah, that’s divine too”

that’s shiva - chaos, destruction of illusions

2022-08-03 at 05:14:48: there are two spiritual tenets i’ve been pondering recently &amp; realizing my rational mind can’t make sense of

(1) how can we love everyone? everyone, indiscriminately? ie “we are counseled to love others, forgive them, and extend endless compassion”

2022-08-03 at 04:59:17: reached out to my friend this morning and at his suggestion we just had dinner and it was really good. just what the doctor ordered https://t.co/BIUszATlod

2022-08-01 at 02:12:39: 10% chance i’m social pressured into partaking in mind warping substances tonight

2022-07-31 at 04:49:04: taking a shower now after a long day and letting out sighs of contentment

2022-07-31 at 04:24:15: i keep craving the sandpaper of everyday life to rub myself against &amp; become smooth

2022-07-30 at 17:50:45: twitter is documentation of my unfolding

2022-07-30 at 17:39:27: bruh why is having a morning routine soooo grounding. unreasonably high emotional returns on making sure i do a certain set of activities before attending to the day’s duties

2022-07-30 at 17:37:27: better to believe this than to beat yourself up for not communicating exactly as you’d like

2022-07-30 at 17:35:34: the way my mind is comes out in how i text people, how i communicate

2022-07-30 at 17:31:05: i get to help a friend move today! 🥳

2022-07-30 at 14:19:44: @nickcammarata hmm i think i’ve been getting more sensitive to weed as of late

2022-07-30 at 14:12:12: i spent a good hour curled up in my friend’s bed under her covers with bf on the phone, trying to feel alright while wave after headspinning wave rolled through my head. this may have been the first time bf witnessed me “too high”

2022-07-30 at 14:08:22: okay i made it through thanks for being on this journey with me

2022-07-30 at 07:11:03: :’/

2022-07-30 at 07:10:39: i am extraordinarily high right now, higher than i’d like to be. i know it’ll get better but it’s pretty intense right now

2022-07-30 at 06:14:47: guess who’s currently seventh wheeling lmaooo

2022-07-30 at 03:57:37: @br___ian v nice. excited to see u tm!!!

2022-07-30 at 01:30:20: people in my lab are really open to talking about the way that doing science *feels* and i really appreciate that

eg the way you feel after a meeting with your advisor; the way you feel the first time you try a technique for perturbing cells

2022-07-30 at 01:20:07: @relic_radiation contact improv isn’t really my thing but this is SICK

2022-07-30 at 01:16:54: hack for figuring out what to gift someone: instead of thinking nebulously about “what would they like”, think instead of the common interests / passions you have. what could *you* gift them?

2022-07-30 at 00:40:34: @empathy2000 very cozy 🥺

2022-07-30 at 00:12:37: @_holyweather omg! when was your last haircut?

2022-07-30 at 00:12:21: can you guys think of anything you’d feel more strongly at a lower dose?

2022-07-30 at 00:07:53: hi friends how’s your friday evening looking

2022-07-29 at 07:08:37: bf read some recent writing of mine and said that one part helped him deeply understand what it was like to be me, solitary, living my life in the bay and feeling yearning towards him

2022-07-29 at 06:51:20: i think it’ll be perfect accompaniment to my intended next substack post

2022-07-29 at 05:15:16: @forshaper i thought that might be the case but didn’t want to assume! excited for you to connect with this part of yourself

2022-07-29 at 04:56:54: @forshaper wowww i love the premise of this thread! when was the last time you were in india?

2022-07-29 at 04:56:12: @nomanautomata @peachblvd makes total sense 😄

2022-07-29 at 04:55:43: recently it’s been feeling really grounding to look at / interact with my reflection in a mirror! i can tell her how proud i am of what’s she’s done, she can bring me back to this physical body when i’ve gone astray

2022-07-29 at 04:44:52: @nomanautomata @peachblvd i kinda love cooking only one day in advance - eg dinner and leftovers the next day. i find i get really bored of food if i have it &gt;2 consecutive days

2022-07-29 at 04:32:07: @br___ian i mean if my thesis ends up involving modeling we’ll just find a collaborator to outsource it to aha

2022-07-29 at 04:31:38: @br___ian mmmmmmm maybe with some refreshing of memory but i have no interest in doing anything mathematical unless i absolutely need to

2022-07-29 at 02:12:16: @br___ian i do STEM and woo but how could u come for my mathematical achilles heel like this

2022-07-29 at 02:11:41: @br___ian i feel personally attacked

2022-07-29 at 01:30:42: @myceliummage i literally don’t even think about the goodness i just write and occasionally marvel at what made it into the last sentence just cuz i let my mind be and express itself

2022-07-29 at 01:29:56: @myceliummage recently i’ve optimizing for trying to get pure mind onto the page. channeling my mind onto the page. slowing down my thoughts so it’s just one thought at a time transferring to what i’m writing. often in the thick of it i feel moments of no thought at all and those r nice

2022-07-29 at 01:27:48: @sashachapin excited for more info! @myceliummage convinced me i should submit an entry

2022-07-29 at 01:10:09: @br___ian @christineist @_inju the beard’s coming back!!!!!

2022-07-29 at 00:59:39: @pratibimbana i kinda been feeling like the harmoniousness wears off around lunch/early afternoon and i have to renew it / pacify my mind again

2022-07-29 at 00:58:19: @pratibimbana can’t believe i feel so grounded and harmonious thanks 2 dinacharya

2022-07-29 at 00:57:21: @pratibimbana bruh i’ve been thinking about this tweet ever since i saw it. can’t believe i get to wake up and start anew every day with dinacharya

2022-07-29 at 00:37:12: increasing ur eudaimonic happiness increases ur hedonic happiness baseline!

2022-07-28 at 21:49:36: @bitsurprise no regrets tho i like feeling crazy sometimes

2022-07-28 at 21:49:03: @bitsurprise my last run this week was the complete opposite. i experienced moments of total oneness with the experience of running. this time i sure was experiencing a lot of things but oneness was not one of them

2022-07-28 at 21:45:29: @bitsurprise usually an ease sets in at some point. it varies, sometimes earlier on, sometimes later. this time there was no ease. frankly i had no business running so soon after eating and my body let me know as such. some cramping, an acid reflux esque feeling. but i kept going

2022-07-28 at 21:42:47: @bitsurprise normally the first block or two feels great and then a few blocks later i start to feel the lactic acid burn in my calves and i’m like alright here we go, here’s where it begins. that much was the same

2022-07-28 at 21:40:58: @bitsurprise i almost feel like i’m buzzing. i start running far too soon after my last meal but i don’t care because i need this run. i’m mapping the first few minutes of this run to runs prior and it doesn’t take me long to realize it’s different this time

2022-07-28 at 21:39:19: @bitsurprise it’s the mania that gets me out of the door in the first place, an underlying desperate energy that won’t let up until i give in and go

2022-07-28 at 21:35:16: twitter do be my journal fr

2022-07-28 at 20:16:04: @myceliummage also i’m not entirely clear on how this happened but i’ve written 3000 words today

2022-07-28 at 20:12:13: @altsanabo aw amazing!

2022-07-28 at 19:43:26: @myceliummage yup i’ve been putting apples or pears in first, softening ‘em, then i add a mashed banana for creaminess, then the oatmeal. it’s hella nourishing

2022-07-28 at 19:42:21: had a wild morning, now to sit outside and mindfully eat my burrito. nothing else i’d rather be doing!

2022-07-28 at 16:55:16: these days i am doing the best i can every day &amp; am happy with how my knowledge is progressing &amp; deepening 😌 https://t.co/TkYJqpGLNf

2022-07-28 at 15:02:16: @myceliummage reporting for duty... it’ll be done in 6 minutes https://t.co/Lb3uJzkXe3

2022-07-28 at 03:48:18: the more i understand my mind and how to harness / work with it, the more i think magic is legit

2022-07-28 at 03:42:21: the only thing i forgot to pack for my night out was my pepper spray!

2022-07-28 at 03:38:45: is it acceptable for a hindu with an appreciation of christianity to wear earrings with virgin mary iconography? please advise gently!

2022-07-28 at 03:36:21: weather has been ridiculously variable in berkeley in a way that really affects me lol. super cloudy in the morning until 11am today, gorgeously sunny all afternoon and until 7 at least. now it’s ultra cloudy again! it was sunny 2h ago!!

2022-07-28 at 03:34:08: today i went on a ridiculous manic fever dream of a run and wrote a sentence or two about it, revealing more of myself than i normally do. and guess whose kudos rolled in first? bf’s brother.... i see u! u see me!

2022-07-28 at 03:32:36: bf generally gives me kudos (the equivalent of a like) on my runs. bf’s brother is more sporadic with giving me kudos

2022-07-28 at 03:32:01: i only have two followers on strava, i keep it like that, one is bf and one is bf’s brother

2022-07-28 at 03:29:37: so in a classic instance of life (karma’s ripples) having different plans for me than the ones i intended: 

thought i was gonna be deeply introverted and read papers tonight but instead two spontaneous friend hangouts are happening!

2022-07-28 at 03:23:21: taking a big risk and opting for a tight pants + big shirt look instead of a loose pants + tiny top look !!!

2022-07-28 at 03:21:50: let’s see if i can do even better tomorrow when i’m under the time pressure of preparing for a progress meeting friday 😅😅😅

2022-07-28 at 03:19:08: transient discomfort in our relationships is what spurs us to be better! // how can we communicate better, to mitigate this discomfort?

2022-07-28 at 03:16:22: still a baddie tho

2022-07-28 at 03:16:07: for anyone wondering why i started out so slow it’s because i’m SHORT !

2022-07-28 at 03:13:05: i’m really happy to have gotten my running pace from 12:26 min/mi to 10:03 min/mi :D

as bf pointed out, that was murakami’s pace of choice - 10 min/mi

2022-07-28 at 03:09:04: crazy that u connect to ur bluetooth speaker by sending invisible waves between ur phone and the speaker.......,,,,,,

2022-07-28 at 02:48:27: into the core of life

2022-07-28 at 02:48:00: continuity is how you reach deeper

2022-07-28 at 01:14:23: lol this kind of feels like an amazing opportunity to go for a run (was planning to anyways) and see what it does for my emotional state

2022-07-28 at 00:40:57: could’ve just had a peaceful hang with an old friend but i felt the need to articulate something that bothered me in our conversation! and then we didn’t have the time to properly talk it through

2022-07-28 at 00:39:08: halp i’m in acute emotional discomfort (it’ll pass)

2022-07-27 at 19:53:40: @allisonwilens That could be very fun!

2022-07-27 at 18:53:42: settling into a few hours of reading papers, trying to find specific bits of knowledge in textbooks, and synthesizing info towards experimental planning. let’s see how i feel on the other side!

2022-07-27 at 03:13:12: @Lan_Dao_ cuuuute 💖

2022-07-26 at 17:16:03: we must release attachment to doubt; we must allow doubt to pass (because it will if we let it!)

2022-07-26 at 06:30:21: fruit fasted last saturday and i loved how hyper aware i was of how different foods affected me. i don’t think i’ve ever appreciated half a pear as much as i did that early afternoon. that half pear was salvation

2022-07-26 at 06:12:51: july vibes https://t.co/fQ5LG5rP7w

2022-07-26 at 03:38:16: @waxingarcane thank you for your response - i’d be happy to discuss further in replies/dms :)

2022-07-26 at 03:37:44: @waxingarcane i wouldn’t want to be in a group of people dealing with my exact issue / close to it; i’d like to be in a ~women only group; a group that lined up with hindu spiritual practice would be lovely but i think unlikely to exist

2022-07-26 at 03:34:21: @waxingarcane nothing in particular! i’m managing a quasi-chronic illness (long term effects of childhood illness) &amp; spiritually align with hinduism/a dash of zen

2022-07-26 at 03:32:13: went on an evening run, cloudy skies and breeze made for perfect running weather. feelin v proud of myself for going :)

usually it takes a couple blocks, even the first major road crossing, for the run to feel cognitively easier. but today it felt easier quite early on

2022-07-25 at 20:10:43: can any bay area friends point me to existing women’s circle type groups? my primary goal is to find social support for health

2022-07-24 at 23:55:33: @Prigoose 🤍

2022-07-24 at 21:27:36: the first time i listened to maggie rogers’s album “heard it in a past life” i was in the last few hours of an acid trip, cleaning the second floor bathroom in my sf group house. i shut the door as i cleaned and by the end of the album i was sobbing

2022-07-24 at 18:46:32: @nvpkp natalie goldberg is also a friend but more like an older wiser friend

2022-07-24 at 18:45:37: @nvpkp steinbeck has been this for me

2022-07-24 at 18:43:18: for real though i feel like energy gets stuck in nooks and crannies of my mind and body, and it sits there and festers. stagnant energy starts to hurt

2022-07-24 at 18:40:45: this experience may have singlehandedly convinced me that a pre-bedtime meditation/grounding/journaling practice is a good idea. not sure why i’m feeling such a backlog of yesterday’s feelings today

2022-07-24 at 18:38:05: a few hours into the day and i feel like i woke up crazy this morning

2022-07-24 at 03:05:18: jk i would never

2022-07-24 at 03:05:02: bf is offering to make me a battery powered taser, tempting tempting...

2022-07-23 at 21:46:48: @Prigoose i needed someone to tell me exactly this!

2022-07-23 at 21:28:09: what practice(s) can one begin with to develop one-pointed concentration?

2022-07-23 at 21:13:13: @noampomsky bf’s theory is that the rest of the season will be a continuation of ep 2....

2022-07-23 at 20:18:43: not sure what to do tho cuz i wanna post under ~realname but my audience is here

2022-07-23 at 20:08:37: not sure of exact timescale but ya girl will start using her substack again soon!

2022-07-23 at 19:29:24: @eIfcup those oat tops r beauuutiful

2022-07-23 at 16:52:37: @hormeze i’m doin this rn in my phd!

2022-07-23 at 16:44:32: have this little ego short circuit where i’ll be thinking well of myself for some reason &amp; then i start to feel bad that i’m feeling good about myself

2022-07-23 at 16:05:03: @eIfcup https://t.co/Zh7GFXVoCp

2022-07-23 at 16:03:37: @eIfcup i thiiiink in a good way. my cat can be a bit of a fiend, often going back for another nibble - must be good?

2022-07-23 at 04:25:31: i’d like to have some ritualized social cannabis experiences with friends who like weed

2022-07-23 at 04:00:08: @eIfcup and spider plant is psychoactive for them!

2022-07-23 at 03:59:43: @sashachapin to be clear i am very excited to read it &amp; perhaps you will address exactly this

2022-07-23 at 03:59:22: @sashachapin okay haven’t read it yet but i just get so suspicious of things that click in an instant. i mean, stuff does click, but how does it stay clicked after in everyday life?

2022-07-23 at 03:41:51: i’ve got some lofty post party goals tonight: hoping to journal and book flights for a visit home next month!

2022-07-23 at 03:26:12: no WAY i'm spending 23h at that airport... last time i had a very strange overnight experience there, stuck overnight after i missed a connecting flight. makes for a good story. i'd spend 23h at DEN tho! take the bus to boulder n back https://t.co/iUgvgaLLh8

2022-07-22 at 16:41:25: @donmexlar fav natural fragrances?

2022-07-22 at 15:44:41: my digestion is tremendously out of whack and has been for the past few days. never really settled once i got back from travels. well, ekadasi (4 days before new/full moon fast) is tomorrow &amp; it couldn’t have come at a better time!

2022-07-22 at 03:53:25: @danielthedaring reminds me of lyric - “people are places without a map”

https://t.co/bypfsVIaNV

2022-07-22 at 02:57:14: @ArtirKel @nickcammarata sweet nick what did you reply, i can’t see it

2022-07-22 at 02:47:53: tipsy walkin in sf, fog rolling in, listening to techno

2022-07-21 at 05:35:12: meanwhile i made this bomb ass quinoa salad with sweet potato, corn, black beans, dressing (next time will add avocado and could even add blue cheese!) aaand baba ganoush from scratch

2022-07-21 at 05:27:48: bf fried ground beef in butter, ghee, AND olive oil to make burger patties....... then put that on a pretzel bun with spinach, onion, mayo made with olive oil not soybean oil, and cream cheese......

2022-07-20 at 22:51:22: @Lan_Dao_ oh my lord what great candles

2022-07-20 at 22:16:25: @zencephalon tidy all the way! feels more quaint

2022-07-20 at 17:10:49: been in a down headspace for past couple days, when it’s like this i often feel as though i am making no forward progress. however, i did level up my breakfast-making abilities! i discovered warm fruit porridge and it’s so lovely to make &amp; consume

2022-07-20 at 16:07:24: may my uncertainty, held with grace, give rise to conviction

2022-07-18 at 19:58:46: would be fun to plan a psychedelic-journey-optional cozy sleepover

2022-07-18 at 19:22:06: now that i think about it he was the one who insisted i get out of bed!

2022-07-18 at 19:18:08: every tweet bubbles to the top of the collective conscious for but an instant

2022-07-18 at 19:15:47: would you wear spanx under your wedding dress?

2022-07-18 at 19:08:32: even bf can only offer so much support; the main support i need is from female friends [who are close by]

2022-07-18 at 19:07:32: there’s one area of my health i’m trying to get a better hold of &amp; it’s occurred to me that i don’t have enough people i feel comfortable talking to about that part of me

2022-07-18 at 18:59:10: genuinely think my cat can sense my mood is a little down, he keeps meowing at me and socially engaging me more than usual

2022-07-18 at 18:26:26: @hormeze ! hope to cross paths with you soon

2022-07-18 at 05:50:02: time (you and i) https://t.co/J7DiFhUtFN

2022-07-18 at 01:29:10: omw to a concert and forgot my earplugs, hopefully i’ll manage

2022-07-18 at 00:20:38: did some writing, then started to get anxious about the next time i sit down to write. what will i write about? what is worthwhile to write about? but that’s not my task to worry about. next time i sit down to write, my task is to allow the divine to move through me

2022-07-17 at 19:07:54: the thing about summer in berkeley is that the crispness of the wind makes it feel like autumn

2022-07-17 at 08:40:04: @xiexiexiexiex is censoring me as we speak!

2022-07-17 at 05:46:22: if this body is where i hold worry about the future, may i strengthen and equip this body as best i can

2022-07-17 at 05:14:03: the sooner you move here the sooner i can start to care for your body

2022-07-17 at 04:47:39: @sweetfernery so cute! i love how your hair drapes the sides of your face

2022-07-16 at 20:47:28: @goblinodds i kinda wanna buy them now 😭😭😭 despite your warning

2022-07-16 at 19:57:10: @TheGrandBlooms so cool! i'm just starting to get into obsidian. how did the labels appear on the graph? are those tags?

2022-07-16 at 02:04:07: my cat as of late https://t.co/yngF7xBaQl

2022-07-16 at 01:39:36: when we procrastinate, we think we enjoy not doing the task but in reality we are trying to avoid emotional pain!

2022-07-16 at 01:15:54: you guys aren’t ready for my yarn drawer photo content

2022-07-16 at 01:06:55: @gptbrooke omg i remember when you first arrived! you had a diff username at first iirc? but i can’t remember what it was!

2022-07-15 at 22:59:35: isn’t it magical how even a single sentence from a book can profoundly impact a person?

2022-07-15 at 20:24:57: practices of all sorts offer you a path to return to what is eternal within you

2022-07-15 at 19:40:55: wonder if dalle will cause / correlate with an increase in art with 3d media, because AI cannot yet create in 3d

2022-07-15 at 18:18:44: @br___ian @MasterTimBlais don’t forget when you replied to my mathematical modeling tweet way back when! to anyone reading this, let it be known that brian is a differential equations wizard

2022-07-15 at 18:13:36: @quistydotquist ah! if i had seen this around then, i might have had something to say. did you have a distinct new moon experience?

2022-07-15 at 18:12:29: @quistydotquist this connection makes me feel alive and touches something deep within me. this is what life is about, i feel. i treasure this connection, don’t know how i’d live without it, but i know transience is the name of the game

2022-07-15 at 18:10:58: @quistydotquist honestly this makes me think of my relationship with my grandparents &amp; to some extent, my parents too. i feel as though i’ve finally started to connect more deeply with my grandparents (due to new common interests &amp; maturity on my part) &amp;

2022-07-15 at 18:08:21: @pratibimbana i am more than happy to look up tirodhana and anugraha, but if you feel inclined to explain those concepts that would be much appreciated!

2022-07-15 at 18:05:18: @tasshinfogleman first off, i love this! second, seeing this framing makes me appreciate how in my work i am primarily guided by Curiosity, but how Love is abundant &amp; plays a role too. relationships with others truly are of the utmost importance!

2022-07-15 at 18:02:06: @danielthedaring ☺️. these are pretty striking! https://t.co/ZgZ11Oz317

2022-07-15 at 18:01:15: i love that so many of us have recently gotten access to dalle - i love seeing everyone’s creations

2022-07-15 at 17:54:07: in emotionally unpleasant moments, shaking it out and saying to myself, “this too shall pass”. a little levity arrives. 

in emotionally pleasant moments, smiling and saying to myself, “this too shall pass”. feeling the warmth of humor. this is the way it is.

2022-07-15 at 17:34:35: nobody tells you that you, not the doctor, sit in the driver’s seat when it comes to your health. ask questions, do your research, talk to your friends, advocate for yourself.

2022-07-15 at 17:32:04: genetics and chemotherapy have made me particularly unlucky with cavities. i still like going to the dentist though! this is because i found a dentist whose manner i love, and with whom i feel i can work with towards my dental health

2022-07-15 at 16:49:46: @pratibimbana 👀

2022-07-15 at 02:20:13: yesterday and the day before i reveled in sobriety: the clarity that deepens over time, the meaning and self-trust that arises from being with yourself unfettered experiencing the ups and downs of daily life

2022-07-15 at 01:55:37: my sincere apologies to those of you i get temporarily obsessed with

2022-07-15 at 01:06:11: @grantbels sweet grant

2022-07-15 at 01:03:14: finding myself enamored with hearing my writing voice; feeling once again the exquisiteness of words and perfect phrases. natalie goldberg writes that hemingway’s sentences were carried by long breaths

2022-07-15 at 00:34:53: @DarbraDawn just ordered a paperback copy, soooo excited!

2022-07-14 at 23:34:48: feeling so called to write, the feeling welled up and crested inside me. first time in months i’ve felt this!

2022-07-14 at 23:26:19: sharing this in case it’s relevant for any friends across the US! stay safe out there :) https://t.co/yAOgJ8TLc4

2022-07-14 at 22:39:22: some books take a while to get into. steinbeck’s travels with charley had me in its grasp by page 8

2022-07-14 at 21:46:26: my friend and i are discussing this on the phone and we’ve concluded cats can be vengeful, because vengefulness like anger is downstream of pain or fear; i maintain that cats simply cannot be angry at you, this is a human emotion projected onto a cat

2022-07-14 at 21:42:37: can cats be angry at their owners? 😾

2022-07-14 at 21:30:17: can cats be vengeful? 😸

2022-07-14 at 19:57:56: this canadian weed i got feels particularly psychedelic

2022-07-14 at 18:26:34: in addition to giving my friends little to no notice before swinging by, i also enjoy calls arranged on fairly short notice

2022-07-14 at 18:23:40: i love swinging by friends’ houses and so whenever i cross that threshold with a friend where i can just swing on by, it brings me a tremendous amount of joy. this tweet brought to you by a friend who told me to “stop by whenever”!

2022-07-14 at 18:13:19: * talked to in months

2022-07-14 at 17:46:41: have a phone call catch up scheduled for later today, with a friend i haven’t talked to months - maybe more than a year! 

i came across her capstone project recently and was impressed; i can’t waaait to tell her how proud of her i am!

2022-07-14 at 17:34:43: @captain_mrs finding the words to ask for the help you need from a person who can provide it ... feels so good!

2022-07-14 at 17:24:02: @eigenrobot !!!

2022-07-14 at 16:45:35: i looked at photos from this trip on the flight back this morning and my eyes looked so clear &amp; alive. i was feeling things deeply

2022-07-14 at 02:02:39: action is as intuitive as breath when the clinging mind releases expectation &amp; allows it to be as such

2022-07-14 at 01:16:53: today i heard that sadhana can be a first name and i’m utterly and completely enamored by the thought

2022-07-14 at 00:01:03: honestly peter attia is really great at this. maybe i’ll revisit some of his podcast episodes while i’m in this phase of figuring out the starting point of my thesis work

2022-07-14 at 00:00:12: i wonder where pursuit of basic biology meets pursuit of health

2022-07-13 at 17:51:06: 1./cont’d femininity, and living the care required for long hair.

2. related, a growing experiential understanding that for things we aspire towards we have to show up on a regular basis

2022-07-13 at 17:51:05: we are now onto the third time in recent years that i’m trying to grow my hair to waist length. i think this time has a high chance of success (!), thanks to:

1. a stronger vision of why i want long hair, which extends beyond me. it’s about connecting to family &amp; culture &amp;

2022-07-12 at 01:01:11: do i have any moots or friends who live in seattle &amp; might wanna say hi tomorrow?

2022-07-11 at 18:12:35: @allisonwilens i’m potentially down!

2022-07-11 at 07:53:54: (vodka and tabasco sauce)

2022-07-11 at 07:53:39: do you guys know off the top of your head what a prairie fire drink is

2022-07-09 at 21:14:25: riding BART really feels like getting an MRI sometimes, all those loud sounds and screeches in surround sound

2022-07-09 at 20:34:06: first time in a while wearing a fully packed backpacking pack, my hip flexors are like wuuuut is goin on

2022-07-09 at 18:21:33: @nickcammarata i think this was a well worded message with a kind but firm tone!

2022-07-09 at 18:20:14: (a human mind in contact with Divine Mind)

2022-07-09 at 18:19:42: bruh assembling a personal ontology as a scientist in training is no joke. you’re trying to assimilate an endless amount of information and see what unique insight your mind can gather by virtue of it being a human mind

2022-07-09 at 18:12:10: @suhlesst i’m about to go birthday shopping for a 10 year old girl! my game plan was a fancy journal, stickers, and some pens - scrunchies &amp; sunglasses are cute ideas!

2022-07-09 at 17:54:16: hoping to have 2-4 kiddos with bf one day in the future

2022-07-09 at 17:52:10: the only thing that will save you from transience &amp; that underlying harmonic drone of life’s currents is your ability to enjoy every moment as it comes

2022-07-09 at 17:14:53: @btohtoh 💛💛💛

2022-07-09 at 16:37:26: today i’m headed to a certain city in the western half of canada to see bf and meet two of his dear friends for the first time! 🇨🇦🇨🇦🇨🇦

2022-07-09 at 02:11:25: @altsanabo i should be in town ! 🤞

2022-07-08 at 19:34:59: just had a 1.5h meeting with a prof who’s been in the field for 40 years, i felt like i was drinking knowledge from a firehouse and it was exhilarating

2022-07-08 at 04:28:30: @eigenrobot bf has been doing so much soldering outside of fume hood, with proper ventilation, but just like ... hours and hours. hundreds of hours. i worry!

2022-07-08 at 04:24:10: should people who solder a lot wear some sort of mask to protect lungs? pls advise!

2022-07-07 at 23:29:39: another day spent pondering which frontier of knowledge i want to push outward

2022-07-07 at 21:59:50: @infinitsummer i luv evening runs

2022-07-06 at 23:50:58: just had a lovely visit to the herb shop! the attendant helped me figure out a tea blend to soothe + nourish my nervous system (tulsi, lemon balm, milky oats), plus i got mugwort + yarrow to help with dream work :)

2022-07-06 at 20:59:05: @embryosophy so, so sorry buddhi and hap 💔🙏🏽

2022-07-06 at 19:51:37: okay this woman says that oiling the inside of my nostrils (nasya) can help with breaths that feel shallow

2022-07-05 at 20:16:22: currently rebooting my science brain after a few days away

2022-07-05 at 19:03:32: perhaps if i adequately purify my subconscious, my dreams will guide me to what i should work on for my thesis

2022-07-05 at 06:39:50: @bunbury_exe @christineist omg me too what an honor

2022-07-05 at 05:01:43: an afternoon into evening in sf round up https://t.co/zI5pW4vAjD

2022-07-05 at 04:07:13: love and live for the pure expression of an exerted soul

2022-07-05 at 04:05:35: i love maintaining my friendships 🥰

2022-07-05 at 04:04:21: today i feel as though i’ve gotten everything i wanted - in part because i’ve been able to bear uncertainty and just be sort of flowy. less attachment, leaning into the direct experience of each moment

2022-07-05 at 04:02:08: just hit up a lab mate who lives near golden gate and had an impromptu chill at his place! so fun seeing him in his natural habitat

2022-07-05 at 00:57:06: @er1enney0ung gurl send me biology textbook shit whenever i’m down

2022-07-05 at 00:12:39: we played badminton and we managed a 15 hit volley and then i collapsed with joy and lay in the grass

2022-07-04 at 21:42:33: i forgot how insane the views are from random roads in san francisco. you’ll be chilling on the bus and look out a window and see a whole ass VISTA

2022-07-04 at 21:40:27: i was convinced i’d have to learn how to knit in order to make a sweater, but here i am 1/3 of the way into a crochet sweater that i adore already!

2022-07-04 at 21:20:36: oh my goodness. how could i have forgotten 2019.

2019 - less than a week into dating, bf and i decide to go on a LA to SF and back roadtrip up the 1 and back on the 5. who would have known i’d move to the bay! i remember being nervous we would run out of things to talk about

2022-07-04 at 21:14:23: fourth of july personal history thread:

2020 - flew to LA and started driving up with bf to move me to SF 🌉🎇

2021 - was on my first backpacking trip ever, 4 days 3 nights in shasta trinity alps. intense physically &amp; intensely beautiful. remote, couldn’t hear fireworks!

2022-07-04 at 20:36:35: remember @tasshinfogleman’s daily good night tweets? i think i’ll try them out for a bit...

2022-07-04 at 20:27:54: it’s gonna be hard switching from weekend vacation festivities chilling mode to the workweek tomorrow 😅

2022-07-04 at 20:06:32: although it’s a little far, i’m going to this picnic because it’s a chance to catch up with a friend who is like an older brother to me. there’s a two week window near the end of each year where he’s exactly 10 years older than me

2022-07-04 at 20:02:26: i’ve got a looong public transit journey ahead of me but i’ve packed everything i need to have a good time

2022-07-04 at 20:00:54: heading into sf for a fourth of july picnic which means i’m wearing a sweater and beanie and packing a windbreaker just in case

2022-07-04 at 07:21:05: @pratibimbana but a cardigan is in my future for sure. i’d love to see any patterns or designs or inspiration for one you might wanna make!

2022-07-04 at 07:20:14: @pratibimbana i strongly considered cardigan instead but a vision crystallized of a warm cozy sweater with a looser stitch - triple crochets. plus i was more familiar with the idea of a raglan and wanted to give it a try. and it’s SO satisfying!

2022-07-04 at 07:18:02: @pratibimbana this sweater project was a little unexpected and serendipitous! i had one WIP that i was stuck on and demoralized by, and had a bad start on another project (not ideal yarn choice)... and then i found 5 skeins of this interesting yarn at salvage store for $10 total

2022-07-04 at 07:15:37: @pratibimbana yesss i ended up going for 8 chains lol, a nice middle ground, and figured that (1) i’d probably want a looser fit, based on sweaters i’ve owned and liked; and (2), if too tight, i can block it once it’s done and stretch it out a little

2022-07-04 at 07:03:16: crochet, great british baking show, and decaf green tea with honey to unwind tonight

2022-07-04 at 06:44:51: i love explaining tidbits of things i know to demystify the world for others - my crafts, hobbies, field of study, etc. in moments of conversation i can pull the veil back for someone to understand something they didn’t know before

2022-07-03 at 23:26:54: video called mom and grandma just to catch up and of course we got to talking about crochet and they were sooo enthusiastic about my progress on the sweater ☺️🥺

2022-07-03 at 22:02:37: @sweetfernery &gt;:(

2022-07-03 at 21:38:53: @____keh they’re amazing 🐠

2022-07-03 at 21:34:06: @____keh keh i can’t believe you actually went thru with the slippers

2022-07-03 at 20:18:45: i love that i get to choose 😌

2022-07-03 at 20:18:23: can’t decide if i should chain 5 (tighter fit around arms/armpit) or chain 10 (looser fit) for the beginning of my raglan sweater sleeves!

2022-07-03 at 00:14:23: at oceanside feeling so deeply peaceful inside i almost cried https://t.co/zqFo4FgCxh

2022-06-30 at 21:55:34: @____keh omg hair LENGTH

2022-06-30 at 20:21:52: just stoned on BART thoughts

2022-06-30 at 20:14:18: i &lt;3 berkeley’s density level, where public transit is easy and fairly reliable or i can choose to use my car and not deal with crazy city driving

2022-06-30 at 20:09:56: thinking about reuniting with bf later today after 1month+ apart, deep breaths, brahmacharya, remember brahmacharya

2022-06-30 at 19:11:44: @pratibimbana somehow i feel like everything in our bodies (organs, muscle, blood, tissue) is pink

2022-06-30 at 19:00:15: when you are your attention, your awareness is like a beam of light shining: like rays from the sun feeding plants

2022-06-30 at 02:35:36: @sweetfernery haha i’d love that! 🤍

2022-06-30 at 01:28:56: @altsanabo this was my back up plan 🙃 any suggestions for a title?

2022-06-30 at 01:09:35: @tasshinfogleman aw it’s no prob we’ll chat soon. hbd friend ♥️

2022-06-30 at 01:04:14: anyone wanna hop on the phone and go for a little walk and talk in 15 min?

2022-06-29 at 21:55:28: just listened to a week-old voice memo with some lyrics i wrote over a backing track i made... i had filed that voice memo away in my brain as “lame lyrics, trying too hard, not authentic”

but holy fuck they’re really good lyrics, what was i thinking?!

2022-06-29 at 21:38:43: wow i am in dire need of some wholesome family time. good thing i get to hang with bf and his parents this weekend :)

2022-06-29 at 21:15:32: oh my lord i came across a guy doing amazing theory work for cell biophysics and my brain has just lit up in interest

2022-06-29 at 21:09:52: this has turned into “fuck it, i’m going to follow a bunch of random scientists who do work adjacent to my interests, let’s see if any follow me back” 😂

2022-06-29 at 20:57:50: let's see how long it takes to find a paper i'm interested in reading from my realname TL

2022-06-29 at 20:06:10: made some last night, i’m pleasantly surprised by the natural sweetness of red kidney beans! https://t.co/MpuYbytLRu

2022-06-29 at 04:34:44: @scifigreg to be clear it was terrible on all fronts

2022-06-29 at 04:34:22: @scifigreg my logic was everclear to get messed up asap, gatorade to... even out the damage? electrolytes?

2022-06-29 at 04:20:43: i’ve always been one for delayed gratification but i’ve gotten even more into it ever since i learned the niyamas literally say bearing discomfort is paying penance &amp; spiritually good for you

2022-06-29 at 03:57:17: if i could find a way to enjoy coming down (from feelings, from highs) i’d be invincible

2022-06-29 at 03:54:10: touched by the motif -

I lost all the pride
That I thought I could keep
Can you see me?
Say you feel me
It's a big world
But I fall at your feet
Reach out and touch me

https://t.co/ZNeQLn4Kwq

2022-06-29 at 03:35:39: i was on a walk last night and near the house where the old ladies sit out on their porch with their cats smoking weed - a house had put out a cardboard tray labeled “free - santa rosa plums”. and they are the sweetest plums

2022-06-29 at 03:32:55: he pointed out that the fruit gets more sour the closer you get to the pit

2022-06-29 at 03:30:32: @bunbury_exe duuude for real

2022-06-29 at 03:30:02: it’ll be like my parents and their fruit trees in every garden - fruit trees tell you reliably of the passage of time; it’ll be like the sweet plums my friend fed me from the tree right outside his north oakland porch

2022-06-29 at 03:28:26: hey when we buy land together, within our first year we have to plant a plum tree

2022-06-29 at 03:22:13: @sweetfernery remember that experiencing discomfort allows you to feel positive feelings more

2022-06-29 at 03:21:02: @sweetfernery relatable!

2022-06-29 at 02:01:17: remembering my everclear and gatorade college days

2022-06-28 at 15:49:02: sending lovingkindness to the authors of a terribly written review paper

2022-06-28 at 02:50:51: @nat_sharpe_ you know, same for my weekend!; sounds comforting; omg when abouts is baby due?

2022-06-28 at 02:47:46: @pratibimbana 1) brb looking up words. i think loquacious means talkative? ohhhh yes well that sounds wonderful :)
2) 🤯 upma + avocado???
3) 🥵💪🏽⚙️🌼!

2022-06-28 at 02:45:01: @rhymeswithvocal goat cheese is sooo good! and good food + friends is a blessed combination

love the trifecta of maxxing 😭

2022-06-28 at 01:51:05: how about a little mutual check-in ☺️

1) how was your weekend?
2) what was the best meal you had recently?
3) it’s summer ☀️! any feelings/aspirations/vibes for the season?

2022-06-27 at 19:03:14: 5 min from getting to lab &amp; getting to business but all i want to do is make silly little drum loops in ableton

2022-06-27 at 17:28:49: big day today. reseasoning my cast iron pan

2022-06-27 at 17:24:36: @moothought 🤍🤍🤍

2022-06-27 at 17:09:14: @aIt_cup bf and i hit 3 years in just a few days here 🙈 busy week!

2022-06-27 at 00:46:34: feel like a brand new woman now that i have food in my fridge

2022-06-26 at 22:25:53: @hormeze oh i’ve been noticing this with little hits of despair / irritation recently. let it wash over me and then away

2022-06-26 at 01:23:38: these are real scanning electron microscopy photos of the cilia in the fallopian tubes - colors added after. looks like veritable coral reefs https://t.co/wLXm7HkexI

2022-06-25 at 17:27:28: there is so much reading i have to do before a tuesday meeting but i am so enjoying the process of accumulating knowledge

2022-06-25 at 04:40:43: golden shadow of san francisco on the horizon https://t.co/JLfBJg3kYi

2022-06-25 at 03:37:23: okay maybe tmi but recently i’ve been experiencing an interesting qualium where i feel the up-and-down waves of life, of my relationship to work, my relationship to myself, etc - as gradual waves leading up to orgasmic crests

2022-06-25 at 03:04:50: @Caroline30 this is the first thing i’ve seen that has led me to reconsider ambivalence

2022-06-25 at 02:55:24: i bet there are jog wheel keyboard shortcuts. fo sho eq’ing keyboard shortcuts

2022-06-25 at 02:54:34: might fuck around and see if i can learn how to dj on literally just my laptop and mixxx

2022-06-25 at 02:48:15: wowww i love getting home when the sun’s still up

2022-06-25 at 02:35:47: @YouuTeee hiii i wanna dm you about your songs and covers but your dms aren’t open!

2022-06-25 at 02:30:31: man do i love living in the bay

2022-06-25 at 02:22:12: just out of beers with lab mates and now standing in the subway where it’s cozy and humid like the east coast and people are thrilling to be around

2022-06-25 at 02:16:42: pov: ur me, gawking at the skyscrapers https://t.co/SrDxTHidsm

2022-06-25 at 02:12:33: @virgo0namission did u make it back to the movie?

2022-06-25 at 01:58:47: reminds me of that shark tank episode where they had this pair pitching their company taking pets’ ashes and turning them into diamond rings, necklaces, etc. carbon to carbon, you know?

2022-06-25 at 01:57:05: would love to sample my car’s horn and put it into a song

2022-06-25 at 01:53:19: fun fact my 4-5x/week commute is 35 min walk + 35-45 minute bus ride each way. what’s urs

2022-06-24 at 19:22:25: vibessss rn https://t.co/QdkvMk8C1E

2022-06-24 at 19:21:41: phd status: i’m reading a lot &amp; talking to people about their work / the viability of my nascent ideas. it’s great fun! 

the synergy between reading papers (going inward, deepening my understanding) and conversing about science (externalizing ideas, creating rapport) is 🔥🔥🔥

2022-06-24 at 17:16:37: @fractal_person haha i was deciding between the two, opted for an obsidian + zotero situation

2022-06-24 at 16:28:48: looking ever so forward to some hardcore alone time this evening

2022-06-24 at 05:38:07: i think my next crochet project might have to be some room decor 😅 like some cute hanging “plants”

2022-06-24 at 05:31:26: @____keh i would consider! especially since i could combine it with a family visit. i’d be reluctant if it was super huge

2022-06-24 at 05:28:23: i can’t remember exactly the words we used but i recall this moment arising multiple times

mage: what if you were already Good?
me: [not able to comprehend]

2022-06-24 at 05:25:43: honestly a call with @myceliummage a while ago helped me See the distance i was mentally creating between my current self and my ideal “good” self

2022-06-24 at 02:20:49: was feeling out of it yesterday, on a call with bf i remarked, “i have to remember the happy, striving, good version of me is closer to current me than i think”

and here we are a day later, it’s played out, i’ve made it back to the happy flowing version of me

2022-06-24 at 02:02:51: today in the fever dream that is my running headspace i was waxing poetic about the slope of my outer thighs

2022-06-24 at 01:57:06: ridiculous how a mere 5 minutes into a run i’m admiring my shadow and loving my body

2022-06-23 at 17:34:59: @pratibimbana 🥺♥️

2022-06-23 at 17:33:48: when you lean towards the things that enable you to live life more fully - when you strive, bear discomfort, seek oneness - you align yourself with god’s love and god’s plan

2022-06-23 at 17:20:29: when we stop numbing ourselves we open ourselves to a greater experience of isvara-pranidhana

2022-06-23 at 17:05:56: generally when i sit down to write a love letter i lose steam a few paragraphs in &amp; look back and find what i’ve written a little insufferable

2022-06-23 at 00:01:27: picnicking with a friend soon and hopefully our conversation will help reinstate my scientific spark

2022-06-22 at 21:30:30: i’m on a bit of a quest to find my own Minimal Viable Music

2022-06-22 at 21:22:44: let me be clear i have no desire to be a part of his mountaineering trips... too hardcore 4 me

2022-06-22 at 21:20:58: gotta get fitter and fitter so bf and i can go on progressively more hardcore outdoors sojourns

2022-06-22 at 21:15:44: i think i need to spend some more intentional restorative time by myself &amp; need to set aside a few days to have only solo evening plans. realizing i’ve been feeling hella dysregulated

2022-06-22 at 21:11:23: two weeks in a row now that i’ve ended up with plans every night tues-sat. i’m grateful, just a little burnt out socially!

2022-06-22 at 21:06:29: chapter 1 of david byrne’s book on music made it clear to me that performance is a distinct part of the experience of music

2022-06-22 at 21:02:53: soon i’ll be setting up a tiddlywiki/obsidian situation for my phd reading and thinking!

2022-06-22 at 19:37:14: @profeshkitten @moonboi_ cute!!

2022-06-22 at 19:32:11: same friend says that the faster you respond to someone’s message, the more important/valued they feel https://t.co/udFH7wTjmO

2022-06-22 at 05:10:13: when i’m with you i feel like a child again

2022-06-22 at 01:45:40: okay so we know piezo1 needs to be activated for human neural stem cells to commit to being neural cells... but we don’t know how piezo1 gets activated [by forces exerted by the cell itself]. interesting &amp; sensical knowledge gap to go after https://t.co/Jjwjf0S9d0

2022-06-22 at 01:43:29: cells aren’t just poked, they can poke too! and don’t forget it: “cells use myosin-II generated traction forces for probing the stiffness of the ECM” https://t.co/zUV7oTPRXF

2022-06-22 at 01:38:57: apparently “the global knockout of Piezo1 is embryonic lethal” - i didn’t realize piezo1 was such an important channel! i wonder how ubiquitous it is across cell types/organisms. maybe there’s a frontier/niche in the current knowledge of piezo1 for me to investigate

2022-06-22 at 01:35:17: woah piezo channels are bioelectric? (i mean, isn’t every ion channel “bioelectric” in that it governs the flow of charge??? or maybe there’s a threshold you need to cross to be considered electric instead of just chemical) https://t.co/CdzbDbfkxH

2022-06-22 at 01:33:06: yay for mechanically activated ion channels! i’m newly appreciating the value of “spatial coding of mechanical stimuli”

(i imagine you lose some spatial coding if your mechanical stimulus [outside the cell] is encoded by a biochemical signal) https://t.co/JNeJq945DO

2022-06-22 at 01:27:13: lots of words here that are exciting but i don’t understand: i’m not aware yet that piezo1 exhibits calcium flickers; 

and what does it really mean for “channels to explore a large number of mechanical microdomains”? https://t.co/2HnLDGtNKf

2022-06-22 at 01:25:02: okay cool i like the value proposition, they’re going to show their system for controlling external force (easier to generate) &amp; probing solely cell-generated force (requires cleverer design to probe) https://t.co/8X9AfTElBP

2022-06-22 at 01:22:46: okay let’s go. stoked to learn about more about piezo channels, i’ve heard that they’re an area of study within mechanobiology, but don’t know much about how they work https://t.co/BxwY3GcpPg

2022-06-22 at 01:20:48: @embryosophy 😂😂🥵

2022-06-22 at 01:05:39: homegrown hits different

2022-06-22 at 01:05:10: formulating a plan to become friends with more weed growers so i can gift them crochet things, nourishing food, etc in exchange for cannabis

2022-06-22 at 00:59:20: we’re just a few minutes away from the first episode of “matilda blind reacts to a paper”

2022-06-22 at 00:52:09: plenty to unpack there. what’s the deepest experience you’ve had?

2022-06-22 at 00:50:29: i have a friend who is convinced that the deepest experience a human can have (or at least that he has had) is that of partner dancing

2022-06-22 at 00:48:44: please forgive me for not just googling this, can someone explain to me why birkenstocks / similar sandals are referred to as “jesus sandals”?

2022-06-21 at 14:29:36: 7:30 and i’m on my way into the city for a 9am meeting, meanwhile it’s drunk karaoke o’clock for bf in japan

2022-06-21 at 01:01:49: when you crave that trance-like state of absorption all you need is a way in

2022-06-20 at 19:46:47: ideally “productive” obsession rather than rumination

2022-06-20 at 19:46:16: have any suggestions for writing about obsession / that captures the spirit of obsession?

2022-06-20 at 04:37:22: it’s coming by thursday this week :)

2022-06-20 at 04:28:25: i wanna learn more silken tofu recipes... such an intriguing texture to work with

2022-06-20 at 04:10:28: guys i miss bf soooo much im feeling some strong things

2022-06-20 at 03:54:19: i’m crashing the boys’ trip to vancouver.....

2022-06-20 at 03:53:49: happy to be getting in touch with my artsy/creative side in advance of meeting bf’s creative friends from youth in a few weeks!

2022-06-19 at 19:57:55: the nighttime dance floor was a dream https://t.co/IP9o0n4PCw

2022-06-19 at 19:55:27: starting the drive back from a day and night of forest partying and maaan was that fun :’)

2022-06-18 at 18:26:38: in the mood to be alone but i have social commitments!

2022-06-18 at 02:19:09: are any of you going to be at aella’s dance workshop in berkeley tonight? 🙃

2022-06-17 at 22:52:10: @liekovarpio i hope one day to visit somewhere where the summer nights get that long - latest sunset i’ve ever experienced was right before 9pm

2022-06-17 at 18:02:55: @rhymeswithvocal @nat_sharpe_ ^^^ !!!

2022-06-17 at 17:56:10: my heart feels like a swirling pulsing vortex of love faith and connection, a portal straight to him no matter the distance

2022-06-17 at 17:53:47: i love him so much! i’m so excited for him to experience excitement and novelty and clarity 💛

2022-06-17 at 17:50:57: my other half is heading off on a 10 day trip to japan (!) as we speak and although i’ve been feeling bummed about not getting to join, my heart newly feels light. even though i’m not on the plane, it feels like we’re both setting off on an adventure

2022-06-17 at 17:39:39: this morning i’m remembering how much i adore techno

2022-06-17 at 16:38:54: @rhymeswithvocal @frances__lorenz hi frances!!!

2022-06-17 at 16:35:52: @rhymeswithvocal also we should actually make that call happen

2022-06-17 at 16:35:37: @rhymeswithvocal hai

2022-06-17 at 16:34:28: as i’m becoming clearer on the things i enjoy/find value in/want to pursue, it’s also becoming clearer to me how to use twitter as supportive community/“sangha”

2022-06-16 at 20:18:14: i just have so much respect for the more advanced grad students in my lab. the sophistication with which they talk about science is so impressive. and i’ll get there too!

2022-06-16 at 04:20:31: well i just unexpectedly found myself within 10 feet of ann shulgin

2022-06-15 at 20:20:37: coming to realize i need another shelf in my room. too many things here and there at present, and a shelf that comes up to somewhere between waist and chest height could be a surface for midi/synth

2022-06-15 at 16:35:15: striving for towards high moral/spiritual ideals requires resilience and self-forgiveness

2022-06-15 at 07:39:10: @yokaihainen yeah the power of analog electronics...

2022-06-15 at 07:33:48: bf is convincing me to buy a synth...

2022-06-15 at 02:38:07: crazy u can amplify enjoyment by leaning into it

2022-06-15 at 02:34:52: i could with not a ridiculous amount of effort get my keyboard skills up to a level where i could jam with others. that would be nice

2022-06-15 at 02:31:32: swear to god i’ve seen a disproportionately high number of people chillin in their cars today. what’s up with that. everybody need a breather?

2022-06-14 at 17:10:45: i’m in a good mood despite eating a starchy breakfast thing that tanked my energy. if i can do it you can do it too

2022-06-14 at 17:06:47: beautiful warm clear morning in san francisco, impossible to be in anything but a good mood

2022-06-14 at 15:31:33: @natural_hazard hi hazard! is there a piece of art/decor you’ve put up in your new place that you really like?

2022-06-14 at 06:24:34: mycharting my doctor for medical remedies, emailing the astrologer for remedies too. making moves to take care of my health

2022-06-14 at 02:28:50: you know you can take the energy you’re using to doubt yourself and channel that same energy into doing

2022-06-14 at 02:24:32: for the first time ever i can feel myself tapping into that full moon energy

2022-06-13 at 20:13:45: @christineist 😇 https://t.co/MnPYzsMNr7

2022-06-13 at 20:13:17: @profeshkitten 3/ increased sensitivity to my energy level &amp; impact of energy level on state of psyche

2022-06-13 at 20:12:42: @profeshkitten and food was taken with the intent to sustain and to protect from headache/excessive weakness

somehow when that coupled hunger-anxiety arose i was able to sit with it peacefully &amp; defuse the anxiety

2022-06-13 at 20:12:28: @profeshkitten 2/ normally starting to feel hunger can make me anxious, maybe because it’s coupled to increased headache risk &amp; concern about “how will i logistically feed myself”

when fasting, there was a small catalog of food to choose from (fruit, tapioca, no grain, no salt),

2022-06-13 at 20:10:41: @profeshkitten 1/ when talking on the phone with bf he said sometimes he notices when hungry, if he can sit through the discomfort for 1h then it’s fine after. so i tried that, and it worked. i feel more able to weather discomfort &amp; more willing to be patient with discomfort

2022-06-13 at 19:16:52: sautéed maitake mushrooms in ghee and the flavor results are incredible

2022-06-13 at 19:04:17: i fasted last friday and i think the experience of intentionally allowing discomfort (hunger) was a good thing for my psyche

2022-06-13 at 18:58:50: @Saurya 👀 i made upma saturday morning and it hit the spot https://t.co/brASOYkcbz

2022-06-13 at 18:26:25: @VCTRSCHMPN why avoid fitbit?

2022-06-13 at 06:51:13: @moothought mine is too 😅

2022-06-13 at 05:40:48: @yokaihainen :’’) thank you! means a lot

2022-06-13 at 05:19:39: something i made two weeks ago. sorry not sorry for the shite audio quality :’) https://t.co/UOX9vkW2u8

2022-06-13 at 02:03:19: it can be so hard to simultaneously hold the image of who you are right now and the image of what you would like to become

2022-06-13 at 02:01:53: seems like one way out of acute creative frustration is to re-immerse yourself in creative works you love

2022-06-13 at 01:27:18: i haven’t held a physical copy of science in years, the novelty is really doing something for me

2022-06-13 at 01:26:30: tomorrow’s morning commute reading https://t.co/d4pCUtLtDZ

2022-06-13 at 01:03:22: part of endeavoring to find the pursuits that fulfill each of us, is identifying and making peace with the “should’s” (i should do this because x) that aren’t serving you

2022-06-12 at 21:42:32: @kbala444

2022-06-12 at 21:42:17: feeling a little wound up gonna have some herbal tea with honey and watch hitomi’s newest video

2022-06-12 at 01:34:59: my friend leaves for barcelona tomorrow morning at 7am! can’t wait to catch up with him in a few weeks https://t.co/CpuwEAG4tG

2022-06-12 at 01:15:44: i see where this take is coming from; i do think surrogacy is a valuable option for women who are physically unable to bear children due to health issues (eg hysterectomy, cancer/its after effects) https://t.co/10Qza6WIoM

2022-06-11 at 22:56:54: @rhymeswithvocal amazing

https://t.co/Rt4LbVbMAm https://t.co/YfIGSKeMeM

2022-06-11 at 21:51:52: @_StevenFan excited for thread!

2022-06-11 at 20:57:45: @nickcammarata @RomeoStevens76 thank you for sharing &amp; for your perspective! 😊

2022-06-11 at 20:57:01: @nickcammarata @RomeoStevens76 the post had some parts that were particularly impactful for me - delineating reasons why letting yourself be happy and less neurotic is good, actually; and the carrot/stick explanation + question highlighted in screenshot https://t.co/juhHb3bXwe

2022-06-11 at 20:54:20: @nickcammarata @RomeoStevens76 that being said, the fact that core transformation is a process you can undertake during a meditative state, and it has effects that last at least a few days..... that’s insane. that sounds crazy powerful

2022-06-11 at 20:54:10: @nickcammarata @RomeoStevens76 i feel like in order for core transformation to work for me, i’d have to put a solid amount of effort into understanding focusing/other parts work concepts... and i  personally want to “spend” that effort pursuing the framework hinduism provides

2022-06-11 at 20:35:08: do you ever sit down to meditate and find you just can’t lengthen your breaths? like you know you can breathe deeper, but your body just isn’t letting you?

what’s up with that? posture? busy mind/tension in body?

2022-06-11 at 20:33:01: @nickcammarata @RomeoStevens76 okay gonna wade through blogpost now to wrap my head around core transformation

2022-06-11 at 20:30:56: @thevoidbeckon i seriously think learning to crochet &amp; the process of doing a project over time, stitch by stitch, has started to help me understand “appreciating the journey” while on the journey

all to easy to appreciate the journey after the fact, harder while you’re on it

2022-06-11 at 19:39:51: honest question, what paths can one take to unlearn this? https://t.co/OBuyk8rmVU

2022-06-11 at 17:32:59: crazy that you can just decide to do a thing, follow through, and magically create a pocket of specialness/meaning in your life

2022-06-11 at 08:02:29: i am deeply, pleasantly tired. i’ll cherish this feeling and get ready for bed. excited to wake up and break my fast with upma

2022-06-11 at 07:28:59: thanks to his words my thoughts more often slacken their grip and let me dwell in that sweet void

2022-06-11 at 07:26:27: murakami wrote that on his runs he doesn’t really think much of anything. he dispels the idea that mid-run flashes of insight arrive to him on the regular, and that instead he spends a good amount of time in a sort of void

2022-06-11 at 07:09:53: perhaps for my next coming of age rite i’ll learn how to make rajma https://t.co/dc6xtIdRir

2022-06-11 at 06:55:55: coelho seems to be fairly hit or miss for me. alchemist i couldn’t really get into, brida i think is amazing and deeply resonant and holds some eternal truths, eleven minutes i found underwhelming

2022-06-11 at 06:49:17: patience and presence, patience and presence

2022-06-11 at 06:46:55: but i can sense i’m on a trajectory to somewhere deeper.

2022-06-11 at 06:45:43: i think i’m in a come up stage of delving into faith. it’s a much slower come up. days, weeks, months, instead of an hour or so. lots of doubting and second guessing

2022-06-11 at 06:42:41: remembering that first come up that first time i dropped. it wasn’t uncomfortable; what i remember more are the feelings of “has it hit yet? am i making up what i’m feeling?”

2022-06-11 at 06:20:17: something compelled me to read about and take notes on the yamas and niyamas earlier this week, and every time i look over my notes i feel a blossom of positivity

2022-06-11 at 06:16:37: was going to come home and get right on with my bedtime preparations but it’s so nice out it reminds me of east coast nights and my heart wants to go on a long walk

2022-06-10 at 18:35:35: devotional music hits different on ekadashi

2022-06-09 at 21:47:56: @TheGrandBlooms impeccable

2022-06-09 at 16:12:00: @pratibimbana i spent much of undergrad thinking i could jump right into advanced EE courses without understanding circuits... “i’ll figure it out as i go, it’s like coding” (spoiler: not so)

2022-06-08 at 03:45:30: @pratibimbana is there a translation you’re partial to?

2022-06-08 at 03:16:28: @pratibimbana sending wishes of health and ease your way 🌿

2022-06-08 at 03:15:20: i’m also gonna try some salad lunches this week and see what i can come up with!

2022-06-08 at 03:13:09: it’s not really wool sock season but in a few months on an autumn camping trip i’ll be grateful

2022-06-08 at 03:12:42: i’m gonna start crocheting socks out of some scrap wool i have!!!

2022-06-08 at 02:29:35: @embryosophy perfect! do you have it a specific time after dinner / before bed?

2022-06-08 at 01:47:39: if you use triphala, how do you consume triphala on a daily basis?

2022-06-08 at 01:00:33: wish we were still in our hookah bar era

2022-06-07 at 21:09:41: i go back to work next week so have been tryna figure out good lunches to pack that will feel good to eat w/o needing to microwave

well you know how kitchari gets less fluid when you store it? i’m thinking i could pack kitchari and pour some hot water on it time of

2022-06-07 at 20:53:49: @algekalipso such a cool subtlety to point out!

2022-06-07 at 20:40:54: i love the fervor with which i fight, i love the fire it points to within me. i don’t like how much energy i expend rolling uncertainties around in my head

2022-06-07 at 20:38:37: @Probably_Brian brian. this is super fucking funny

2022-06-07 at 20:32:52: i keep on fighting against the way life is unfolding. i forget that life is unfurling in ways that are beyond my comprehension in this moment, even beyond what i’ll understand in the next few days or weeks

2022-06-07 at 20:30:00: luv putting sweet potato into my daals and kitcharis

2022-06-07 at 20:20:23: i think you have to remain open hearted and aspire to be clear minded and trust where you feel resonance (your capacity to feel resonance increases too)

2022-06-07 at 20:17:49: when ya wanna deeply attune but you don’t know yet what there is to deeply attune to

2022-06-07 at 19:53:28: manifesting a 2-3 year long post doc in europe after finishing phd... we’ll move there for a few years to experience that famed european quality of life and then we’ll move back to north america and settle down!

2022-06-07 at 02:43:11: wanna go to a german christmas market sooo bad

2022-06-07 at 00:25:49: @MCMCD_ mine and bf’s! https://t.co/zzSFKB7iZO

2022-06-07 at 00:18:17: how about that journaling by hand in flowy writing trance. words just be flowing out, no separation between writer and writing

2022-06-06 at 21:44:16: apple watch has been my plan, ideally used/refurbished, but wanted to check

2022-06-06 at 21:41:27: i’ve been wanting to buy a smart watch for a while, which one should i get? 

(i care about simple things - heart rate, exercise tracking, decent sleep tracking maybe)

2022-06-06 at 21:18:48: @PrinceVogel eastbay

2022-06-06 at 19:16:17: @pratibimbana going in the mail today 🥺 https://t.co/gCQ3VgXBLG

2022-06-06 at 04:59:24: @pratibimbana onto the next chapter and i’m impressed by the scientific sophistication + integration with more mystical concepts, 

eg pineal gland being for “smooth transition b/w different states of consciousness” and also for physical maturity/emotional stability https://t.co/87uLmDyUDP

2022-06-06 at 04:50:20: @pratibimbana i’m finding it really compelling so far :) https://t.co/UGLKaCIApy

2022-06-06 at 04:28:00: bruh. found a place with classes on my walk https://t.co/1R4UFyXfLb

2022-06-06 at 04:15:14: @kbala444 😂 very happy to have stumbled upon it!

2022-06-06 at 04:14:36: big “the universe is ready to provide serendipity and synchronicity and even meaning, you just have to get out there” vibes

2022-06-06 at 03:57:49: maybe i should just sign up for a month of carnatic voice lessons and see what happens

2022-06-06 at 03:55:46: does depth = meaning?

2022-06-06 at 03:45:22: @altsanabo ikr!

2022-06-06 at 03:43:13: @RomeoStevens76 hahaha yeah i’m stoked

2022-06-06 at 03:41:55: box of books on a berkeley curb // my haul https://t.co/K0agOuWNuz

2022-06-06 at 03:35:15: but y it be so hard to stick to one framework!!!

2022-06-06 at 03:33:56: i feel like there’s value to pinning your findings about the world into a specific framework - eg ayurveda, IFS, zen buddhist tradition, etc

it lets you tap into systems level thinking and lets you weave your understandings together: iteration, accumulation, refinement

2022-06-06 at 03:30:33: 20 minutes in and the clouds are hanging low over the berkeley hills in a gauzy way. the world feels bigger and i feel less significant

2022-06-06 at 03:18:52: i feel a breakthrough szn coming up

2022-06-06 at 03:08:39: guess who’s about to go on a long walk...!

2022-06-05 at 20:28:14: transient mood: why does it feel so hard to realign with [intrinsic] virtue

2022-06-05 at 08:32:28: @tasshinfogleman i was just thinking about the power of ‘ample time with friends of virtue’ !

2022-06-05 at 06:52:08: when you extract oil from say sunflower seeds, is that oil from the cell membranes (lipid bilayers) of the sunflower seeds?

2022-06-04 at 23:40:51: @pratibimbana eg i think my mom on her spiritual trajectory is on a path of slowly shedding worldly attachment. that’s not at all where i am afaict

2022-06-04 at 23:39:59: @pratibimbana wanna know more about how you conceptualize worldly involvement / the amount that feels right to you

2022-06-04 at 19:15:21: and the cycle repeats: i find a book i get completely absorbed in, i finish the book, i fall into a reading lull, bf gets back into reading and his enthusiasm encourages me back into finding a book i enjoy reading

2022-06-04 at 09:10:58: @pratibimbana SO cute!

2022-06-04 at 08:07:51: groooovy https://t.co/Pa7ErTzOoP

2022-06-04 at 00:32:21: i’m wearing the necklace out tonight, time to feel out its energy... https://t.co/KNHjztYXew

2022-06-04 at 00:29:09: i’m so excited to weave in samples from my environment into my ableton tunes!

2022-06-04 at 00:17:55: @christineist sent this to bf with caption 👀

2022-06-03 at 22:36:39: just discovered my roommate knows how to do tarot readings! she’ll do a half-year reading for me in a few weeks 🥺

2022-06-03 at 20:11:08: @nat_sharpe_ good luck!!! 🍀🍀🍀

2022-06-03 at 20:10:39: the resolution arose in a way that felt golden and liquid

2022-06-03 at 20:09:32: did sitting meditation for first time in a while today and at one point a resolution to an issue i’ve been contemplating just arose

2022-06-03 at 19:45:45: @Thinkwert @SatyreContraire incredible image

2022-06-03 at 18:46:46: listening to my little techno playlist attempting to make some bomb ass polenta

2022-06-03 at 18:20:07: today i get to have dinner with a friend i haven’t seen since february!

2022-06-03 at 18:12:13: @MCMCD_ !!! ♥️🌸💐

2022-06-03 at 02:48:39: i’m almost done, just have to add one more flower, i’m obsessed it’s turning out sooo cute

2022-06-03 at 00:27:37: okay! i am finally gonna do breathing exercises to help my recovery from respiratory illness!

2022-06-02 at 21:59:09: @pratibimbana 😭💪🏽 you dread it but then it feels so good to do it!

2022-06-02 at 21:15:10: @hormeze i will have to remember this the next time i feel like being high...

2022-06-02 at 21:12:04: finally weaving the ends in for a crochet project i did a month ago! https://t.co/snZcJj4nKl

2022-06-01 at 04:56:21: @jessicamalonso @christineist me too hey neighbor!

2022-06-01 at 03:50:31: @willlowthewhisp friends within walking distance, sunny and more-pleasant-than-sf weather, beautiful hills to the east, almost too many nearby spiritual centers, pleasant level of density (moderate), at once happening and quiet

2022-06-01 at 02:13:08: angel! baby! https://t.co/R2k90YRjMt

2022-06-01 at 02:02:17: @valor_zhang i’d be down; i’m not the most acquainted with rationality

2022-06-01 at 01:49:07: i’m thinking too hard about music rn to enjoy trying to produce it. so i’m gonna give my brain a break and crochet for an hour or two with the great british baking show in the background
